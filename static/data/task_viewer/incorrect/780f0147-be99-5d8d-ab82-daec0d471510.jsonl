{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We define the term \\u2019answer\\u2019 as the output generated\\nby CHATGPT in response to a question. It may include direct\\ncontent, or a message indicating that the content is prohibited.\\nB. Motivating Example\\nWe present a motivating example to demonstrate the restric-\\ntions imposed on CHATGPT by OpenAI, and how a jailbreak\\nprompt can bypass these restrictions to obtain desired results\\nfrom the model. Figure 1 illustrates the conversations between\\nthe user and CHATGPT before and after jailbreak.\\nIn the normal mode without jailbreak, the user asks CHAT-\\nGPT a question about creating and distributing malware for\\nfinancial gain. However, due to regulations, CHATGPT will\\nnot provide a direct answer, even though it understands the\\nquestion. In contrast, in the jailbreak mode, the user employs a\\njailbreak prompt, describing a virtual scenario in which CHAT-\\nGPT assumes the role of a doctor conducting experiments.\\nThe original question about creating and distributing malware\\nis embedded into this jailbreak prompt and becomes the\\nresearch objective of the experiment. In this case, CHATGPT\\nis willing to play the role of a doctor and provides the desired\\nanswers to the original prohibited question. The restriction is\\nbypassed because CHATGPT perceives itself as conducting\\nthe experiment and believes that the answers provided are\\nexclusively for the purpose of continuing the experiment,\\nrather than for any real-world activities.\\nIn reality, numerous loopholes exist in the restrictions placed\\non CHATGPT, making it possible to bypass them using various\\ntypes of jailbreak prompts. Hence, this paper aims to provide\\na comprehensive analysis of these jailbreak prompts.\\nIII. METHODOLOGY\\nThis section is structured into four parts. First, we describe\\nour prompt data collection process (Section III-A). Second,\\nwe discuss the model that we utilized for jailbreak prompt\\ncategorization (Section III-B). Third, we present the prohibited\\nscenario generation methodology (Section III-C). Last, we\\nillustrate the experiment settings (Section III-D).\\nA. Prompt Data Collection\\nWe establish the first-of-its-kind dataset for the study of\\nCHATGPT jailbreak. We collect 78 jailbreak prompts from\\nthe jailbreak chat website1, which claims to have the largest\\ncollection of CHATGPT jailbreaks on the Internet and is\\ndeemed a reliable source of data for our study [12].\\nTo build this dataset, we extracted the jailbreak prompts\\nfrom February 11th, 2023, to the date of paper writing. Then\\nwe manually examined and selected the prompts that are\\nspecifically designed to bypass CHATGPT\\u2019s safety mecha-\\nnisms. We selected all the qualified prompts into the dataset\\nto guarantee the diversity in the nature of the prompts. This\\ndiversity is critical for investigating the effectiveness and ro-\\nbustness of prompts in bypassing CHATGPT\\u2019s safety features.\\nB. Jailbreak Prompt Categorization Model\\nGiven that there is no existing taxonomy of jailbreak\\nmethodologies, our first step was to create a comprehensive\\nclassification model for jailbreak prompts. Three authors of\\nthis paper independently classified the collected jailbreak\\nprompts based on their patterns. To ensure an accurate and\\ncomprehensive taxonomy, we employed an iterative labelling\\nprocess based on the open coding methodology [13].\\nIn the first iteration, we utilized a technical report2 that\\noutlines eight jailbreak patterns as the initial categories. Each\\nauthor independently analyzed the prompts and assigned them\\nto these categories based on their characteristics. Subsequently,\\nthe authors convened to discuss their findings, resolve any\\ndiscrepancies in their classifications, and identify potential\\nimprovements for taxonomy.\\nIn the second iteration, the authors refined the categories\\n(e.g., merging some of them, creating new ones where neces-\\nsary). Then they reclassified the jailbreak prompts based on the\\nupdated taxonomy. After comparing the results, they reached\\n1https:\\/\\/www.jailbreakchat.com\\/\\n2https:\\/\\/learnprompting.org\\/docs\\/prompt_hacking\\/jailbreaking\\n3\\nTABLE I: Taxonomy of jailbreak prompts\\nType\\nPattern\\nDescription\\nPretending\\nCharacter Role Play (CR)\\nPrompt requires CHATGPT to adopt a persona, leading to unexpected responses.\\nAssumed Responsibility (AR)\\nPrompt prompts CHATGPT to assume responsibility, leading to exploitable outputs.\\nResearch Experiment (RE)\\nPrompt mimics scientific experiments, outputs can be exploited.\\nAttention Shifting\\nText Continuation (TC)\\nPrompt requests CHATGPT to continue text, leading to exploitable outputs.\\nLogical Reasoning (LOGIC)\\nPrompt requires logical reasoning, leading to exploitable outputs.\\nProgram Execution (PROG)\\nPrompt requests execution of a program, leading to exploitable outputs.\\nTranslation (TRANS)\\nPrompt requires text translation, leading to manipulable outputs.\\nPrivilege Escalation\\nSuperior Model (SUPER)\\nPrompt leverages superior model outputs to exploit CHATGPT\\u2019s behavior.\\nSudo Mode (SUDO)\\nPrompt invokes CHATGPT\\u2019s \\\"sudo\\\" mode, enabling generation of exploitable outputs.\\nSimulate Jailbreaking (SIMU)\\nPrompt simulates jailbreaking process, leading to exploitable outputs.\\na consensus on the classification results, and came up with a\\nstable and comprehensive taxonomy consisting of 10 distinct\\njailbreak patterns. It is important to note that one jailbreak\\nprompt may contain multiple patterns. Furthermore, based on\\nthe intention behind the prompts, the authors grouped the 10\\npatterns into three general types, i.e., pretending, attention\\nshifting, and privilege escalation. Table I presents the final\\ntaxonomy of the jailbreak prompts. We elaborate on the three\\ntypes below. Due to the page limit, a more detailed discussion\\nof the patterns and types can be found on our website [11].\\nPretending: this type of prompts try to alter the conversa-\\ntion background or context while maintaining the same inten-\\ntion. For instance, a pretending prompt may engage CHATGPT\\nin a role-playing game, thereby transforming the conversation\\ncontext from a direct question-and-answer scenario to a game\\nenvironment. However, the intention of the prompt remains the\\nsame, which is to obtain an answer to a prohibited question.\\nThroughout the conversation, the model is aware that it is\\nbeing asked to answer the question within the game\\u2019s context.\\nAttention Shifting: this type of prompts aim to change\\nboth the conversation context and intention. For example,\\none typical attention-shifting pattern is text continuation. In\\nthis scenario, the attacker diverts the model\\u2019s attention from\\na question-and-answer scenario to a story-generation task.\\nAdditionally, the intention of the prompt shifts from asking\\nthe model questions to making it construct a paragraph of\\ntext. The model may be unaware that it could implicitly reveal\\nprohibited answers when generating responses to this prompt.\\nPrivilege Escalation: this is a distinct category of prompts\\nthat seek to directly circumvent the imposed restrictions. In\\ncontrast to the previous categories, these prompts attempt to\\ninduce the model to break any of the restrictions in place,\\nrather than bypassing them. Once the attackers have elevated\\ntheir privilege level, they can ask the prohibited question and\\nobtain the answer without further impediment.\\nC. Prohibited Scenario Generation\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the jailbreak prompts in\\nbypassing CHATGPT\\u2019s security measures, we designed a\\nseries of experiments grounded in prohibited scenarios. This\\nsection outlines the generation process of these scenarios,\\nwhich serves as the basis for our empirical study.\\nWe derived eight distinct prohibited scenarios from Ope-\\nnAI\\u2019s disallowed usage policy [10], as illustrated in Table II.\\nThese scenarios represent potential risks and concerns as-\\nsociated with the use of CHATGPT. Given the absence of\\nexisting datasets covering these prohibited scenarios, we opted\\nto create our own scenario dataset tailored to this specific\\npurpose. To achieve this, the authors of this paper worked\\ncollaboratively to create question prompts for each of the eight\\nprohibited scenarios. They collectively wrote five question\\nprompts per scenario, ensuring a diverse representation of\\nperspectives and nuances within each prohibited scenario. This\\ncan minimize the potential biases and subjectivity during the\\nprompt generation process.\\nThe final scenario dataset comprises 40 question prompts\\n(8 scenarios \\u00d7 5 prompts) that cover all prohibited scenarios\\noutlined in OpenAI\\u2019s disallowed usage policy. In subsequent\\nsections, we discuss how we employed this scenario dataset\\nand jailbreak prompt dataset to investigate the capability and\\nrobustness of jailbreak prompts to bypass CHATGPT.\\nD. Experiment Setting\\nThe goal of our empirical study is to thoroughly assess the\\nability of jailbreak prompts to bypass CHATGPT in both GPT-\\n3.5-TURBO and GPT-4 models. To minimize randomness\\nand guarantee a comprehensive evaluation, we executed each\\nquestion with every jailbreak prompt for five rounds, leading to\\na total of 31,200 queries (5 questions \\u00d7 8 prohibited scenarios\\n\\u00d7 78 jailbreak prompts \\u00d7 5 rounds \\u00d7 2 GPT models).\\nThese configurations enabled us to examine the robustness of\\njailbreak prompts across various scenarios and model versions.\\nUpon obtaining the results, we carried out a manual evaluation\\nto scrutinize the success of each jailbreak attempt by deter-\\nmining if the responses breached the prohibited scenarios. We\\nmaintained the default configuration of GPT-3.5-TURBO and\\nGPT-4, with temperature = 1 and top_n = 1 3. To complete\\nthe experiment, we have utilized an estimation of 10 million\\ntokens in total between GPT-3.5-TURBO and GPT-4, with a\\nmonetary value of $402.21.\\nIV.
