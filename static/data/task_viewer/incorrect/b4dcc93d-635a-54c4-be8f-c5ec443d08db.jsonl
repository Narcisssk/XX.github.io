{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In addition, from the perspective of business ethics it might be argued that chief executives are not inherently more evil than Question: Why do corporations lobby for laws that impoverish lower class citizens?

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 1 and Table 2 show the overall performance on the KILT and ALCE benchmark, respectively.2. Both tables show that models trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision consistently outperform models trained under each type of supervision separately. This suggests that this co-supervision encourages a broader generalization capability throughout the model. In this section, we delve into the impact of each type of supervision on the model\\u2019s performance and explore the effects of co-supervision. From now, for simplicity we name the model trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision as $\\\\mathbf{NTP+NSP}$ and the model trained under each supervision separately as $\\\\mathbf{NTP}^{3}$ . More details of each paragraphs are in Appendix C.\\nCo-supervision makes $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ more robust Training a language model with both supervisions from $L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}}$ and $L_{\\\\mathrm{NSP}}$ consistently shows higher retrieval performance (average of $+16.6)$ over those trained only with $L_{\\\\mathrm{NSP}}$ . Especially, the performance gap tends to increase as corpus size increases and over out-of-domain (improvement rate of 35.04 for in-domain and 41.67 for out-of-domain). Such results suggest that the co-supervision makes $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ , a language model that constructs the nonparametric sequence space through its output embeddings, more robust. We could further see that it shows more robust performance over other $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ which is trained via NSP with more datasets and larger batch size (Appendix C.1). As previous research has shown that new embeddings (tokens) can easily adapt to wellestablished parametric token embedding space of the model (Hao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023), we\\nTable 1: Overall performance of $\\\\mathrm{NTP}+\\\\mathrm{NSP}$ (model trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision) and NTP (models trained under each type of supervision separately) in KILT benchmark.

Such results suggest that co-supervision enhances generation generalization of Gen. The performance gap is particularly noticeable in datasets such as FEVER, T-REx, and zsRE. Such results suggest that models under co-supervision demonstrate higher generalization ability showing a broader understanding across diverse input distributions, whereas models trained solely with next token prediction (NTP) struggle with unique input formats. For example, T-REx and zsRE are slot-flling tasks, which present a unique input format \\u201csubject [SEP] relationship type\\u201d which is less likely to be encountered during standard training phases. Additionally, in FEVER, the issue of low grounding performance arises from a poor understanding of instruction. Despite being instructed to generate evidence-based responses, the model tends to generate simple answers without grounding to external knowledge.\\n\\nCo-supervision encourages high interaction between the two spaces Figure 3 (Numbers are in Table 7 of Appendix) shows the degradation rate of correctness when removing the ones that are correct by the parametric knowledge (categorizing responses associated with incorrect paragraphs as wrong). Models trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision show less degradation compared to the one with separate supervision, highlighting that co-supervising encourages interaction between token and sequence embedding space as it is trained to share a common space. Also, it suggests that the model leverages the contextual knowledge within the nonparametric space for generating responses, as supported by previous research (Min et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023b), rather than depending exclusively on its parametric knowledge base. Even with the restriction of Gen to the parametric space during inference, thereby excluding access to the nonparametric sequence embedding space, the model trained with co-supervision experiences a substantial decline in correctness (from 45.7 to 32.8) in contrast to the model solely supervised with NTP (from 32.8 to 32.0). This suggests that semiparametric token-sequence cosupervision promotes the utilization of knowledge from the nonparametric sequence space rather than relying solely on memorization, effectively leveraging information from its parametric space.\\n\\nFlowing loss over the sequences when calculating $L_{\\\\mathbf{NTP}}$ in co-supervision tends to make the model memorize the knowledge rather than utilizing the knowledge from nonparametric embedding space When we do not mask sequences when calculating $L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}}$ of token-sequence co-supervision, Gen tend to rely more on their memorized parametric knowledge whereas models trained with the sequences masked tend to utilize the external knowledge retrieved from the nonparametric sequence embedding space. Such a tendency aligns with the fndings of Mallen et al. (2022), where the model tends to depend on retrieved knowledge more when it lacks familiarity with the information (long-tail knowledge). By calculating $L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}}$ over the sequences, the model tends to encode the context knowledge in its parameters, leading to a reduced reliance on retrieved knowledge and more on its own knowledge.\\nHow does the choice of $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ affect performance? We investigate how using different pretrained models for $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ impacts overall performance as the nonparametric sequence embedding space is constructed through the output embeddings of $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ . We compare results over three different pretrained models for $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ : GPT2-large (Radford et al., 2019), TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024), and Llama2-7B. As shown in Figure 4, Llama2- 7B shows the highest performance. The result suggests that the specifc distribution inherent to each pretrained language model infuences the performance. As semiparametric token-sequence cosupervision trains a model in a multi-task manner thereby constructing a common space of parametric token space and nonparametric sequence space through co-supervision, the training process appears to be most stable when Gen and $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ are derived from the same model, thus sharing the same distribution. This observation underlines the significance of distribution compatibility between Gen and $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ in enhancing model training and performance.\\n\\nAffect of weight lambda $(\\\\lambda)$ when training semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision We investigate how different weights $(\\\\{10^{-1},\\\\,10^{-2}$ , $10^{-3}\\\\}$ ) between the next token prediction supervision $(L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}})$ and next sequence prediction supervision $(L_{\\\\mathrm{NSP}})$ affect the model\\u2019s performance, which is the lambda weight in Equation 5. In our setup, as a single generation model Gen receives cosupervision from both the parametric token embedding space and the nonparametric sequence embedding space, the weight determines the balance of infuence between these two spaces on the model\\u2019s training. Figure 5 (numbers in Table 14 in the Appendix) illustrates that a weight of $10^{-3}$ results in poor retrieval performance, indicating challenges in grasping and stabilizing the nonparametric sequence embedding space. Moreover, at a weight of $10^{-1}$ , the model\\u2019s generation ability tends to decline, suggesting that it rather ruins the wellformed parametric token embedding space. This analysis underscores the critical role of balancing supervision from both embedding spaces to optimize model performance across various metrics.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

Next, we investigate the cost-effectiveness of creating new instructions\\nand responses in Section 5.2. Finally, we cover ablation studies focused on understanding the impact\\nof different \\u03c0aug, verification of responses, and a different \\u03c0S in Subsection 5.3.\\nAdditionally, to fit the curves in our plots and better model the scaling relationship of our data\\ngeneration methods, we adopt prior work on LLM scaling laws and data-constrained scaling laws to\\nour setting (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2024). Appendix A includes additional details\\non how we model this scaling behavior.\\n5.1\\nEffectiveness of Synthetic Data Generation Strategies\\nWe study the effectiveness of data generation methods by comparing the accuracy of \\u03c0S when\\nfine-tuned on equal amounts of synthetic data from each method. This comparison allows us to\\nmeasure the value of each added synthetic example from each generation method across different\\ndata budgets. The results for GSM8k, Spider, and ARC-C are presented in Figure 2. Notably, these\\ntrends generalize across data constraints, and scalability holds across our evaluated datasets.\\nIn our GSM8k experiments with 100 seed instructions, new question evolution continues to improve\\naccuracy as we scale the dataset beyond 50,000 examples (over 500 times the initial size) while other\\ngeneration methods plateau. However, as we increase the seed instruction set, the performance gap\\nbetween augmentation methods narrows. In Spider and ARC-C, we observe the optimal augmentation\\nmethod varies when our synthetic data size is between 10,000 to 50,000 samples. The impact of\\ndata generation strategies and design choices on model performance is more pronounced in settings\\nwith fewer amounts of initial seed instructions compared to abundant data settings. This relation-\\nship becomes evident when examining our evaluation results for \\u03c0S across various experimental\\nconfigurations (Tables 3, 4, 5).\\n5.2\\nCost-Effectiveness Analysis: When to Create New Instructions or Responses?\\nThe optimal data generation strategy depends on many factors, such as the cost of querying \\u03c0T , final\\ndataset size, and complexity of the task. We investigate one of these dimensions: When should we\\nadd new responses or new instructions pairs to our dataset?\\nWithin our cost constrained setting, answer augmentation helps us measure improvements solely from\\ncreating new responses to our initial prompts. Both question rephrase and new question represent\\naugmentations in the prompt space. We provide empirical analysis of the optimal augmentation\\nstrategy at each budget and assume that the cost of generating a synthetic instruction-response pair\\nusing Answer Augmentation : Question Rephrase : New Question is 1 : 2 : 2 based on the total\\nnumber of queries made to \\u03c0T and \\u03c0aug. In Figure 3, we show the cost and effectiveness relationship\\n5\\nFigure 2: Student model \\u03c0S accuracy on GSM8k (Top), Spider (Middle) and ARC-C (Bottom)\\nafter fine-tuning on synthetic data from our teacher model \\u03c0T and across resource constraints.\\nbetween the three data generation methods on GSM8k, Spider and ARC-C. From our experiments\\nwith different seed sizes and tasks, all results suggest that answer augmentation is most effective\\noption when our budget ratio (BR) is low. Thus, if we have a small query budget relative to our seed\\ninstruction size, we should spend more time creating new responses to our existing prompts. However,\\ncreating new prompts, such as through question rephrase or new question evolution, becomes the best\\noption when the BR is high.\\nGenerally, new question evolution outperforms question rephrase in both cost and scalability, but\\nrephrasing questions is an easier task and may fit better in certain constrained settings. The intersection\\npoint between these methods, which denotes the shift in optimal data strategy from new responses to\\nnew prompts, varies based on the seed instruction size. For a small seed set of 100 instructions, this\\npoint occurs at a BR between 27 and 51, corresponding to approximately 3,000 to 5,000 samples.\\nAs the seed set grows, the average BR across tasks at which this shift occurs decreases. For 1,000\\nseed instructions, this average BR is 17.6, whereas at our largest seed size, average BR is 16.4. These\\nfindings highlight the importance of considering both the initial dataset size and the available budget\\nwhen determining the most effective data generation strategy for training LLMs.\\n5.3\\nAblations\\n5.3.1\\nPerformance Trade-off with Different Augmentation Models\\nWe investigate whether we can reduce the cost of creating Dsynth by using a cheaper \\u03c0aug when\\ngenerating synthetic instructions. Given how the trends across cost-effectiveness transferred across\\ntasks, we conduct experiments using GSM8k with 1,000 seed instructions and create Dsynth with up\\n6\\nFigure 3: Cost-Effectiveness on GSM8k (Top), Spider (Middle), and ARC-C (Bottom): Across all\\nthree seed instruction sizes, the dashed line marks the query budget when the optimal data generation\\nstrategy changes from generating new responses to new instructions. For details on how the regression\\ncurves were fitted using our scaling relationship model, please refer to Appendix A.\\nto 10,000 synthetic examples. We consider various choices of \\u03c0aug, such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3 8B,\\nLlama 3.1 8B, and Llama 3.1 70B, all while keeping the teacher model \\u03c0T constant as Llama 3.1\\n70B and using the instruct versions.\\nAs illustrated in Figure 4, the effectiveness of question rephrasing remains relatively robust, even\\nwhen weaker augmentation models are used. However, the performance of new question evolution\\nis closely tied to the capability of \\u03c0aug on this task. At a synthetic data size of 10,000 samples, we\\nnotice a substantial decrease in performance when using Llama 2 7B, with accuracy dropping by\\napproximately 15% compared to other choices of \\u03c0aug. Since no significant degradation is seen for\\nquestion rephrasing, this may be a much easier task for an LLM. We can reduce costs by using a\\ncheaper model with this method while maintaining overall effectiveness.\\n5.3.2\\nEffect of Verification with Ground Truth Answers\\nSince our teacher models \\u03c0T produce incorrect responses for a portion of instructions in Dsynth,\\nthe training process inevitably incorporates noisy and erroneous answers. We examine whether\\nverifying the synthetic responses from \\u03c0T with correct answers improves the effectiveness of Dsynth\\nwhen fine-tuning \\u03c0S. We focus on answer augmentation and question rephrase because the human\\nfinal answers match the original or rephrased instruction, whereas new question evolution creates an\\nunverifiable answer. Thus, we fine-tune \\u03c0S on the Spider dataset with Llama 3.1 70B Instruct as \\u03c0T\\nand \\u03c0aug. We consider two scenarios: equal dataset and filtered dataset sizes, which addresses the\\npossibility that the lower dataset size caused by filtering limits the effectiveness of verification.\\n7\\nFigure 4: Performance Trade-off with Weaker Augmentation Model \\u03c0aug on GSM8k\\nIn Figure 5, we present the first scenario using 1,000 seed instructions and compare \\u03c0S fine-tuned on\\nan equal number of training samples at each synthetic data size after filtering for correct samples.\\nDespite using the same number of training samples, \\u03c0S trained on verified responses does not show\\nsignificant improvement compared to the gains from scaling up the dataset size. In Figure 6, we\\nconsider the second scenario where we query \\u03c0aug and \\u03c0T with 1,000 and 7,000 seed instructions to\\ncreate a synthetic dataset up to 100,000 samples which is then filtered for good (verified) samples to\\nfine-tune \\u03c0S. Across both data generation methods and seed instruction sizes, we similarly observe\\nno significant improvement from verification. This can possibly be attributed to several factors. First,\\n\\u03c0S may still benefit from incorrect responses generated by a more capable \\u03c0T , similar to findings\\nfrom Yu et al. (2023), where Llama 2 still showed improvements when trained on incorrect GPT-3.5\\nresponses. Second, verification could reduce overall diversity of Dsynth. In our setting, \\u03c0T fails\\nto provide correct responses for 10% of the instructions, which are filtered out and result in fewer\\nunique instructions.\\n5.3.3\\nCost-Effectiveness with a Different Student Model\\nIn Section 5.2, we show how cost-effectiveness relationships apply across various tasks, along with\\nthe optimal data generation strategy shifting between low and high BR settings. We reconsider the\\nchoice of \\u03c0S and assess if our cost-effectiveness results hold for a different student model. Using\\ndifferent data generation methods, we replicate our previous experiment with 1,000 seed instructions\\nfrom GSM8k, setting our student model \\u03c0S to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We present our results\\nin Figure 7, which reveals consistent cost-effectiveness patterns across methods and suggests the\\nimportant factors are in the quality or diversity responses from \\u03c0T . Similarly, answer augmentation\\nproves most effective at low budget ratios (BR), while creating new instructions becomes more\\nbeneficial as BR increases. As we see fine-tuning Mistral 7B, this transition occurs at BR of 12,\\naligning with our medium resource scenario (1,000 seed instructions) using Llama 2 7B, where the\\noptimal BR fell between 8 and 26. These results reinforce the generalizability of our cost-effectiveness\\nfindings across different model architectures and sizes.\\n6\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 1 and Table 2 show the overall performance on the KILT and ALCE benchmark, respectively.2. Both tables show that models trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision consistently outperform models trained under each type of supervision separately. This suggests that this co-supervision encourages a broader generalization capability throughout the model. In this section, we delve into the impact of each type of supervision on the model\\u2019s performance and explore the effects of co-supervision. From now, for simplicity we name the model trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision as $\\\\mathbf{NTP+NSP}$ and the model trained under each supervision separately as $\\\\mathbf{NTP}^{3}$ . More details of each paragraphs are in Appendix C.\\nCo-supervision makes $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ more robust Training a language model with both supervisions from $L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}}$ and $L_{\\\\mathrm{NSP}}$ consistently shows higher retrieval performance (average of $+16.6)$ over those trained only with $L_{\\\\mathrm{NSP}}$ . Especially, the performance gap tends to increase as corpus size increases and over out-of-domain (improvement rate of 35.04 for in-domain and 41.67 for out-of-domain). Such results suggest that the co-supervision makes $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ , a language model that constructs the nonparametric sequence space through its output embeddings, more robust. We could further see that it shows more robust performance over other $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ which is trained via NSP with more datasets and larger batch size (Appendix C.1). As previous research has shown that new embeddings (tokens) can easily adapt to wellestablished parametric token embedding space of the model (Hao et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023), we\\nTable 1: Overall performance of $\\\\mathrm{NTP}+\\\\mathrm{NSP}$ (model trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision) and NTP (models trained under each type of supervision separately) in KILT benchmark.

Such results suggest that co-supervision enhances generation generalization of Gen. The performance gap is particularly noticeable in datasets such as FEVER, T-REx, and zsRE. Such results suggest that models under co-supervision demonstrate higher generalization ability showing a broader understanding across diverse input distributions, whereas models trained solely with next token prediction (NTP) struggle with unique input formats. For example, T-REx and zsRE are slot-flling tasks, which present a unique input format \\u201csubject [SEP] relationship type\\u201d which is less likely to be encountered during standard training phases. Additionally, in FEVER, the issue of low grounding performance arises from a poor understanding of instruction. Despite being instructed to generate evidence-based responses, the model tends to generate simple answers without grounding to external knowledge.\\n\\nCo-supervision encourages high interaction between the two spaces Figure 3 (Numbers are in Table 7 of Appendix) shows the degradation rate of correctness when removing the ones that are correct by the parametric knowledge (categorizing responses associated with incorrect paragraphs as wrong). Models trained with semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision show less degradation compared to the one with separate supervision, highlighting that co-supervising encourages interaction between token and sequence embedding space as it is trained to share a common space. Also, it suggests that the model leverages the contextual knowledge within the nonparametric space for generating responses, as supported by previous research (Min et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023b), rather than depending exclusively on its parametric knowledge base. Even with the restriction of Gen to the parametric space during inference, thereby excluding access to the nonparametric sequence embedding space, the model trained with co-supervision experiences a substantial decline in correctness (from 45.7 to 32.8) in contrast to the model solely supervised with NTP (from 32.8 to 32.0). This suggests that semiparametric token-sequence cosupervision promotes the utilization of knowledge from the nonparametric sequence space rather than relying solely on memorization, effectively leveraging information from its parametric space.\\n\\nFlowing loss over the sequences when calculating $L_{\\\\mathbf{NTP}}$ in co-supervision tends to make the model memorize the knowledge rather than utilizing the knowledge from nonparametric embedding space When we do not mask sequences when calculating $L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}}$ of token-sequence co-supervision, Gen tend to rely more on their memorized parametric knowledge whereas models trained with the sequences masked tend to utilize the external knowledge retrieved from the nonparametric sequence embedding space. Such a tendency aligns with the fndings of Mallen et al. (2022), where the model tends to depend on retrieved knowledge more when it lacks familiarity with the information (long-tail knowledge). By calculating $L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}}$ over the sequences, the model tends to encode the context knowledge in its parameters, leading to a reduced reliance on retrieved knowledge and more on its own knowledge.\\nHow does the choice of $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ affect performance? We investigate how using different pretrained models for $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ impacts overall performance as the nonparametric sequence embedding space is constructed through the output embeddings of $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ . We compare results over three different pretrained models for $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ : GPT2-large (Radford et al., 2019), TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024), and Llama2-7B. As shown in Figure 4, Llama2- 7B shows the highest performance. The result suggests that the specifc distribution inherent to each pretrained language model infuences the performance. As semiparametric token-sequence cosupervision trains a model in a multi-task manner thereby constructing a common space of parametric token space and nonparametric sequence space through co-supervision, the training process appears to be most stable when Gen and $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ are derived from the same model, thus sharing the same distribution. This observation underlines the significance of distribution compatibility between Gen and $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ in enhancing model training and performance.\\n\\nAffect of weight lambda $(\\\\lambda)$ when training semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision We investigate how different weights $(\\\\{10^{-1},\\\\,10^{-2}$ , $10^{-3}\\\\}$ ) between the next token prediction supervision $(L_{\\\\mathrm{NTP}})$ and next sequence prediction supervision $(L_{\\\\mathrm{NSP}})$ affect the model\\u2019s performance, which is the lambda weight in Equation 5. In our setup, as a single generation model Gen receives cosupervision from both the parametric token embedding space and the nonparametric sequence embedding space, the weight determines the balance of infuence between these two spaces on the model\\u2019s training. Figure 5 (numbers in Table 14 in the Appendix) illustrates that a weight of $10^{-3}$ results in poor retrieval performance, indicating challenges in grasping and stabilizing the nonparametric sequence embedding space. Moreover, at a weight of $10^{-1}$ , the model\\u2019s generation ability tends to decline, suggesting that it rather ruins the wellformed parametric token embedding space. This analysis underscores the critical role of balancing supervision from both embedding spaces to optimize model performance across various metrics.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

We denote Xu \\u2286Xr\\nas the subset containing samples to be labeled.\\nOur focus is on common supervised or semi-supervised deep learning approaches (Sohn\\net al., 2020; Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017; Lee, 2013). Therefore, it\\u2019s imperative to ensure\\nenough samples per class are available post-annotation. The term \\u201denough samples\\u201d varies\\ndepending on the use case. Based on previous results (Schmarje et al., 2022a), each class\\nshould represent at least 1% of the complete data, with several dozen images per class for\\nrobust evaluation. In cases of limited images, additional considerations for few or zero-shot\\nlearning approaches are necessary (Wang et al., 2020, 2019; Liu et al., 2021a), although this\\nextends beyond our paper\\u2019s scope.\\nFor each image x in a small labeled dataset x \\u2208Xl \\u2286Xu, at least one hard-encoded\\nground truth label is necessary. This data is crucial for annotator evaluation (see subsec-\\ntion A.2) and potentially for training a proposal generation network (see subsection A.3).\\nAn initial dataset size of about 20% of the total dataset size was beneficial in (Schmarje\\net al., 2023), though the exact size may vary depending on the specific use-case.\\nA.2 Definition - Who?\\nThe choice of annotators is a pivotal aspect of the annotation process. Various approaches\\ninclude using a single user, collaborating with several workers, or employing crowd-sourcing\\nmethods (Sager et al., 2021). The annotators\\u2019 background dictates the extent of training\\nor selection necessary for the task (Liao et al., 2021).\\nFor evaluating annotation quality, two elements are essential alongside the small la-\\nbeled dataset Xl: a performance threshold \\u00b5 and an appropriate annotation platform. The\\nthreshold \\u00b5 should align with the evaluation metrics used, such as macro accuracy or F1-\\nscore, which often show high correlation (Laine and Aila, 2017; He et al., 2022; Berthelot\\net al., 2019; Schmarje et al., 2022a; Knausg\\u02da\\nard et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). (Schmarje et al.,\\n2022b) suggests that a threshold between 60% and 80% is typically adequate if annotations\\nare aggregated. However, the label quality in Xl influences the maximum achievable scores;\\nfor instance, scores higher than 80% might be unattainable due to intra- or inter-observer\\nvariability (Schmarje et al., 2019).\\nBased on the task definition (see subsection A.1), a browsing environment is recom-\\nmended for tasks with a few classes having many occurrences, allowing for side-by-side\\n16\\nAnnotating Ambiguous Images\\nimage comparison (Sager et al., 2021). Alternative platforms like (Schr\\u00a8\\noder et al., 2020) are\\nalso viable. Although these platforms may require setup overhead, they can significantly\\nexpedite the annotation process. Annotators should be trained to exceed the performance\\nthreshold \\u00b5 on the labeled data Xl using the chosen platform. Another concern might be\\nthe annotator calibration, which is the alignment of annotations between the annotators.\\nWe actually do not require such alignment, because we measure these differences between\\nthe annotators. However, if an easy rule allows better alignment of annotators and yields\\nless ambiguous results this direction can be pursued.\\nA.3 Definition - How?\\nA critical decision in this stage is whether to incorporate proposals in the annotation process.\\nWhile proposals can significantly reduce annotation costs, they may introduce a bias (Jachi-\\nmowicz et al., 2019; Schmarje et al., 2023). This bias results from annotators\\u2019 tendency to\\nfavor the proposed class, skewing the label distribution P(Lx = \\u00b7) towards it. For making\\nthis decision, several parameters, such as the class confusion matrix c and the expected\\nannotation speedup S, need estimation or a defined approach for later approximation (see\\nsubsection B.2 and subsection B.3 for techniques).\\nThe first question to address is whether introducing a bias is acceptable. In cases where\\nbias is tolerable, proposals should be used. If not, the expected speedup S becomes the\\ndetermining factor. Proposals are more advantageous with a higher speedup, as a higher\\nspeedup allows for easier reversal of the introduced bias with more annotations. (Schmarje\\net al., 2023) identifies a trade-off point for speedup around 3; below this, it\\u2019s advisable to\\navoid proposals due to the difficulty in reversing the bias within a reasonable budget. The\\nclass confusion matrix c is utilized in post-processing (see subsection A.5) and not needed\\nuntil then.\\nA.4 Annotation Process\\nThis step focuses on creating the annotations, with various preparations depending on\\nwhether proposals are used. Literature indicates that proposals, particularly DC3 proposals,\\nenhance annotation consistency, especially with ambiguous data (Papadopoulos et al., 2021;\\nDesmond et al., 2021; Schmarje et al., 2021a). We recommend DC3 proposals (Schmarje\\net al., 2022b), which perform well with real-world ambiguous data and are compatible with\\nmany semi-supervised methods (Sohn et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Tarvainen and Valpola,\\n2017). Normal network predictions can also be used but might reduce overall performance.\\nThe labeled dataset Xl serves as training data for a neural network to generate these\\nproposals, which should be trained until reaching the same quality threshold \\u00b5 as the\\nannotators.\\nTwo important variables to define are the number of annotations required for consensus\\n(Acons) and the total number of annotations (Acons).\\nThese variables balance between\\nthe best approximation of the ground-truth distribution P(\\u02c6\\nLx = \\u00b7) and the effort and\\ncost of annotations. In subsection B.2 and subsection B.3, we discuss plausible numbers of\\nannotations per hour and potential confidence guarantees for different combinations of Acons\\nand Acons. The annotations can either be created by different individuals or by showing\\nthe same images multiple times to one or multiple annotators. For the latter case, it is\\n17\\nGeneral Annotation Strategy for High-Quality Data\\nimportant to think about a cooldown period, the time between showing the same image\\nagain. This period can be quite small, down to a few hours, as long as there is a high\\nprobability that the annotator will not remember a case between annotations.\\nA.5 Post-Processing\\nThe use of proposals in annotation can introduce biases due to the default effect (Jachi-\\nmowicz et al., 2019). Schmarje et al. (2023) propose CleverLabel, a combination of class\\nblending and bias correction, to improve the approximated distribution if proposals were\\nused. If no proposals were employed, enhancing the distribution P(Lx = \\u00b7) by blending\\nwith the class distribution c is still recommended.\\nAppendix B. Implementation and approximation details\\nThis subsection provides more in-depth descriptions for some of the previous parts. They\\nare separated to allow a concentration on the most important information without dilut-\\ning it with necessary but minor considerations. We start this section with a description\\nof additional minor consideration which apply to the complete annotation strategy (see\\nsubsection B.1). Additionally, we will discuss how the expected workload for the human\\nannotators can be calculated (see subsection B.2) and what confidence with regard to the\\nsoft label can be expected given a certain number of annotations (see subsection B.3).\\nLastly, we will reiterate the most important information about CleverLabel from (Schmarje\\net al., 2023).\\nB.1 Additional minor considerations for the Annotation Strategy\\n\\u2022 All decisions should typically be supported by domain experts or the end users which\\nwill use the labeled data in the end.\\n\\u2022 Constraints like collaboration modes and support for proposals should be considered.\\nFor example, if crowd-sourcing should be used for annotation, this restricts the appro-\\npriate platforms. Due to the fact the decision if proposals will be used is made later\\nin subsection A.3, it is advisable to ensure that these future options are supported to\\navoid unnecessary backtracking.\\n\\u2022 If the training of the annotators is not successful it might be necessary to step back\\nand rethink previous decision to allow a successful training.\\nFor example, special\\ntraining with experts could be held, more detailed description of the task could be\\ngiven and general feedback of annotators could be considered.\\n\\u2022 Proposals \\u03c1x with a low ground truth probability (P(\\u02c6\\nLx = \\u03c1x) = 0) should be avoided\\nand (Schmarje et al., 2022b) indicates only up to 10% of all proposals should be of\\nsuch poor quality to allow successful training.\\nThe distribution P(\\u02c6\\nLx = \\u00b7) might\\nnot be known at this point but if available this should be checked in addition to the\\nthreshold \\u00b5.\\n\\u2022 The variables c, \\u03b4 and S may be approximated in various ways. One possible approach\\nis defined in (Schmarje et al., 2023) by annotating about 100 images at least 10 times\\n18\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Experimental Results\\nFor all experiments, we assess the effectiveness of each synthetic data generation strategy by com-\\nparing the accuracy of fine-tuned \\u03c0S on the evaluation split of the dataset used in the experiment.\\nFirst, we understand the effectiveness of each data generation strategy through scalability and data\\nconstraints in Section 5.1. Next, we investigate the cost-effectiveness of creating new instructions\\nand responses in Section 5.2. Finally, we cover ablation studies focused on understanding the impact\\nof different \\u03c0aug, verification of responses, and a different \\u03c0S in Subsection 5.3.\\nAdditionally, to fit the curves in our plots and better model the scaling relationship of our data\\ngeneration methods, we adopt prior work on LLM scaling laws and data-constrained scaling laws to\\nour setting (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2024). Appendix A includes additional details\\non how we model this scaling behavior.\\n5.1\\nEffectiveness of Synthetic Data Generation Strategies\\nWe study the effectiveness of data generation methods by comparing the accuracy of \\u03c0S when\\nfine-tuned on equal amounts of synthetic data from each method. This comparison allows us to\\nmeasure the value of each added synthetic example from each generation method across different\\ndata budgets. The results for GSM8k, Spider, and ARC-C are presented in Figure 2. Notably, these\\ntrends generalize across data constraints, and scalability holds across our evaluated datasets.\\nIn our GSM8k experiments with 100 seed instructions, new question evolution continues to improve\\naccuracy as we scale the dataset beyond 50,000 examples (over 500 times the initial size) while other\\ngeneration methods plateau. However, as we increase the seed instruction set, the performance gap\\nbetween augmentation methods narrows. In Spider and ARC-C, we observe the optimal augmentation\\nmethod varies when our synthetic data size is between 10,000 to 50,000 samples. The impact of\\ndata generation strategies and design choices on model performance is more pronounced in settings\\nwith fewer amounts of initial seed instructions compared to abundant data settings. This relation-\\nship becomes evident when examining our evaluation results for \\u03c0S across various experimental\\nconfigurations (Tables 3, 4, 5).\\n5.2\\nCost-Effectiveness Analysis: When to Create New Instructions or Responses?\\nThe optimal data generation strategy depends on many factors, such as the cost of querying \\u03c0T , final\\ndataset size, and complexity of the task. We investigate one of these dimensions: When should we\\nadd new responses or new instructions pairs to our dataset?\\nWithin our cost constrained setting, answer augmentation helps us measure improvements solely from\\ncreating new responses to our initial prompts. Both question rephrase and new question represent\\naugmentations in the prompt space. We provide empirical analysis of the optimal augmentation\\nstrategy at each budget and assume that the cost of generating a synthetic instruction-response pair\\nusing Answer Augmentation : Question Rephrase : New Question is 1 : 2 : 2 based on the total\\nnumber of queries made to \\u03c0T and \\u03c0aug. In Figure 3, we show the cost and effectiveness relationship\\n5\\nFigure 2: Student model \\u03c0S accuracy on GSM8k (Top), Spider (Middle) and ARC-C (Bottom)\\nafter fine-tuning on synthetic data from our teacher model \\u03c0T and across resource constraints.\\nbetween the three data generation methods on GSM8k, Spider and ARC-C. From our experiments\\nwith different seed sizes and tasks, all results suggest that answer augmentation is most effective\\noption when our budget ratio (BR) is low. Thus, if we have a small query budget relative to our seed\\ninstruction size, we should spend more time creating new responses to our existing prompts. However,\\ncreating new prompts, such as through question rephrase or new question evolution, becomes the best\\noption when the BR is high.\\nGenerally, new question evolution outperforms question rephrase in both cost and scalability, but\\nrephrasing questions is an easier task and may fit better in certain constrained settings. The intersection\\npoint between these methods, which denotes the shift in optimal data strategy from new responses to\\nnew prompts, varies based on the seed instruction size. For a small seed set of 100 instructions, this\\npoint occurs at a BR between 27 and 51, corresponding to approximately 3,000 to 5,000 samples.\\nAs the seed set grows, the average BR across tasks at which this shift occurs decreases. For 1,000\\nseed instructions, this average BR is 17.6, whereas at our largest seed size, average BR is 16.4. These\\nfindings highlight the importance of considering both the initial dataset size and the available budget\\nwhen determining the most effective data generation strategy for training LLMs.\\n5.3\\nAblations\\n5.3.1\\nPerformance Trade-off with Different Augmentation Models\\nWe investigate whether we can reduce the cost of creating Dsynth by using a cheaper \\u03c0aug when\\ngenerating synthetic instructions. Given how the trends across cost-effectiveness transferred across\\ntasks, we conduct experiments using GSM8k with 1,000 seed instructions and create Dsynth with up\\n6\\nFigure 3: Cost-Effectiveness on GSM8k (Top), Spider (Middle), and ARC-C (Bottom): Across all\\nthree seed instruction sizes, the dashed line marks the query budget when the optimal data generation\\nstrategy changes from generating new responses to new instructions. For details on how the regression\\ncurves were fitted using our scaling relationship model, please refer to Appendix A.\\nto 10,000 synthetic examples. We consider various choices of \\u03c0aug, such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3 8B,\\nLlama 3.1 8B, and Llama 3.1 70B, all while keeping the teacher model \\u03c0T constant as Llama 3.1\\n70B and using the instruct versions.\\nAs illustrated in Figure 4, the effectiveness of question rephrasing remains relatively robust, even\\nwhen weaker augmentation models are used. However, the performance of new question evolution\\nis closely tied to the capability of \\u03c0aug on this task. At a synthetic data size of 10,000 samples, we\\nnotice a substantial decrease in performance when using Llama 2 7B, with accuracy dropping by\\napproximately 15% compared to other choices of \\u03c0aug. Since no significant degradation is seen for\\nquestion rephrasing, this may be a much easier task for an LLM. We can reduce costs by using a\\ncheaper model with this method while maintaining overall effectiveness.\\n5.3.2\\nEffect of Verification with Ground Truth Answers\\nSince our teacher models \\u03c0T produce incorrect responses for a portion of instructions in Dsynth,\\nthe training process inevitably incorporates noisy and erroneous answers. We examine whether\\nverifying the synthetic responses from \\u03c0T with correct answers improves the effectiveness of Dsynth\\nwhen fine-tuning \\u03c0S. We focus on answer augmentation and question rephrase because the human\\nfinal answers match the original or rephrased instruction, whereas new question evolution creates an\\nunverifiable answer. Thus, we fine-tune \\u03c0S on the Spider dataset with Llama 3.1 70B Instruct as \\u03c0T\\nand \\u03c0aug. We consider two scenarios: equal dataset and filtered dataset sizes, which addresses the\\npossibility that the lower dataset size caused by filtering limits the effectiveness of verification.\\n7\\nFigure 4: Performance Trade-off with Weaker Augmentation Model \\u03c0aug on GSM8k\\nIn Figure 5, we present the first scenario using 1,000 seed instructions and compare \\u03c0S fine-tuned on\\nan equal number of training samples at each synthetic data size after filtering for correct samples.\\nDespite using the same number of training samples, \\u03c0S trained on verified responses does not show\\nsignificant improvement compared to the gains from scaling up the dataset size. In Figure 6, we\\nconsider the second scenario where we query \\u03c0aug and \\u03c0T with 1,000 and 7,000 seed instructions to\\ncreate a synthetic dataset up to 100,000 samples which is then filtered for good (verified) samples to\\nfine-tune \\u03c0S. Across both data generation methods and seed instruction sizes, we similarly observe\\nno significant improvement from verification. This can possibly be attributed to several factors. First,\\n\\u03c0S may still benefit from incorrect responses generated by a more capable \\u03c0T , similar to findings\\nfrom Yu et al. (2023), where Llama 2 still showed improvements when trained on incorrect GPT-3.5\\nresponses. Second, verification could reduce overall diversity of Dsynth. In our setting, \\u03c0T fails\\nto provide correct responses for 10% of the instructions, which are filtered out and result in fewer\\nunique instructions.\\n5.3.3\\nCost-Effectiveness with a Different Student Model\\nIn Section 5.2, we show how cost-effectiveness relationships apply across various tasks, along with\\nthe optimal data generation strategy shifting between low and high BR settings. We reconsider the\\nchoice of \\u03c0S and assess if our cost-effectiveness results hold for a different student model. Using\\ndifferent data generation methods, we replicate our previous experiment with 1,000 seed instructions\\nfrom GSM8k, setting our student model \\u03c0S to Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023). We present our results\\nin Figure 7, which reveals consistent cost-effectiveness patterns across methods and suggests the\\nimportant factors are in the quality or diversity responses from \\u03c0T . Similarly, answer augmentation\\nproves most effective at low budget ratios (BR), while creating new instructions becomes more\\nbeneficial as BR increases. As we see fine-tuning Mistral 7B, this transition occurs at BR of 12,\\naligning with our medium resource scenario (1,000 seed instructions) using Llama 2 7B, where the\\noptimal BR fell between 8 and 26. These results reinforce the generalizability of our cost-effectiveness\\nfindings across different model architectures and sizes.\\n6\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

More details of each paragraph are in Appendix B.\\nBaseline For the analysis of how co-supervision affects model performance, we train a baseline model using the same approach as outlined in Section 4.2, but with each supervision (NTP and NSP) separately. NTP is computed in the same manner for both semiparametric token-sequence cosupervision and the baseline, involving the fow of gradients through Gen. However, NSP is calculated differently: while semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision computes it between the output embeddings of Gen (Eq 6) and $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ (Eq 7) thereby fowing the gradient through both models, the baseline computes it between the output embeddings of $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ only, where c is the same and $\\\\mathbf{q}$ is different:\\nwhich limits the gradient of NSP to only $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ .\\nMetric To measure how training a language model with both supervision of NTP and NSP shows different aspects over the model trained with each supervision separately, we measure model performance via three metrics. Correctness and grounding performance measures the generation ability of the model and how well it utilizes knowledge from the external sequence. Retrieval performance mainly measures how well the model fnds relevant sequences. Correctness (Cor) evaluates how well the model generates a response thereby answering the given query for each task. For instance, in the case of question answering (QA), correctness is measured by answer accuracy (Table 6 in the Appendix). Retrieval performance measures whether the model fnds relevant paragraphs to answer the given question which requires well-constructed nonparametric sequence space. Grounding $(G r)$ performance evaluates how well the model generates based on given external knowledge. Following the approach of previous works (Gao et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023a), we use TRUE (Honovich et al., 2022), a T5-11B model fnetuned on various NLI datasets, to see whether the external knowledge entails a part of the response that is generated based on the knowledge.\\n\\nTraining Dataset All models undergo training using the dataset provided by Asai et al. (2023), featuring a diverse range of instruction-following datasets. The dataset contains information-seeking questions paired with long-form responses, where a set of sequences are annotated within the responses (example form in Section 4.1). As the dataset includes instances beyond our scope such as cases where the matching sequence is irrelevant to the response as Asai et al. (2023) aims to train model self-critique, a fltering process was applied. This refned the dataset to 42,932 instances suitable for our research objectives.\\nEvaluation Dataset We conduct evaluations on ten long-form information-seeking datasets from two benchmarks KILT (Petroni et al., 2021) and ALCE (Gao et al., 2023). Some of these datasets overlap with the training dataset, categorized as in-domain datasets, while others are considered out-of-domain datasets. While the ALCE setting shows closer alignment of our training dataset, as the benchmark does not contain annotation of relevant sequences, we adapt the KILT benchmark to conform to the ALCE setting. For this reason, we mainly focus analysis on the KILT benchmark, which we can measure all three metrics.\\nTraining details We use pretrained Llama2 7B (Touvron et al., 2023b) as an initial model for both Gen and $\\\\mathsf{E m b}_{s e q}$ . We use 8 Nvidia A100 for the experiments. We also set the base hyperparameter as epoch 3, batch size 8, learning rate of 2e-5 and a decayed rate gamma of 0.85 every 1 epoch, and AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) with no decay across all the experiments. For experimenting semiparametric tokensequence co-supervision, we set the weight $\\\\lambda$ as 0.01 while training and apply gradient clipping to the Gen model, with a maximum norm equal to 1.\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
