{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"GLM leverages the alignment information to improve the model\\u2019s understanding of the graph structure and enhance its (the model\\u2019s) performance in AMR parsing. Unfortunately, as discussed in the previous section, this constitutes a form of leakage at inference time. Therefore, following the idea of Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015, KD), we set the fne-tuned GLM as a teacher model, which receives both the sentence and WAG as inputs, and our plain BART parser as the student (see Section 4.1). Then, the knowledge acquired by the teacher model is transferred to the student model, which only has access to the sentence. This enables the utilization of WAGs during training while avoiding their use during inference. Hence, our objective is to achieve the following:\\n\\nwhere $p$ and $q$ are probabilities of the student and the teacher, respectively, and $w$ is the WAG, used only at training time.\\nAs is common in KD, we employ Kullback\\u2013Leibler divergence to match the student and the teacher probabilities:\\nwhere $C$ is the number of classes, i.e. our token vocabulary. Usually, the loss $L_{n l l}^{D}$ for the original task is added to the total loss, thus becoming:\\nwhere $\\\\delta_{t}^{i}(k)$ is 1 when $k$ is a target class at step $t$ and 0 otherwise; $\\\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter.\\nThere are only architectural differences between the teacher and the student model at the encoder, since the teacher additionally includes the structural adapters. Therefore, we copy the GLM decoder to the student model and freeze the decoder parameters.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We anticipate that, in our experimentation, KD will have failed to properly transfer the structural information to the student model. Therefore, we propose a single model approach that can be trained by performing two forward passes at each training step, one with and one without the WAG structural information (see Figure 4 and Algorithm 2). We force the two passes to learn the same distribution by adding a Kullback\\u2013Leibler divergence loss to the output logits. As a result, the total loss becomes:\\nwhere $L_{l e a k}$ is the loss for the frst pass (basically, GLM), with leaked information, $L_{n l l}^{D}$ is the loss for the second pass (basically, BART), which is the original negative log-likelihood loss, and fnally $L_{K L}$ is the above-described Kullback\\u2013Leibler divergence loss. $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\beta$ are hyperparameters to control each loss scale.\\nThe above formulation implements what is called self-knowledge distillation (Hahn and Choi, 2019, SKD). Specifcally, in our work we project the knowledge via leveraging data leakage in the frst pass rather than computing soft target probabilities. Moreover, we calculate KL divergence for all classes to obtain more knowledge. Finally, based on the intuition that there is not enough information to distill at the beginning of training, we schedule a gradual decrease of $L_{l e a k}$ \\u2019s multiplier $\\\\beta$ .\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We test on two AMR benchmark datasets: i) AMR 2.0, which has 36521, 1368, and 1371 sentenceAMR pairs in the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, and ii) AMR 3.0, which contains 55635, 1722, and 1898 sentence-AMR pairs in the training, validation, and test sets, respectively (see Appendix E).
