{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, little is known about their robustness to minority subgroups defned by the labels and attributes of a dataset. In this paper, we investigate the effects of 18 different compression methods and settings on the subgroup robustness of BERT language models. We show that worst-group performance does not depend on model size alone, but also on the compression method used. Additionally, we fnd that model compression does not always worsen the performance on minority subgroups. Altogether, our analysis serves to further research into the subgroup robustness of model compression.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"In recent years, the feld of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen a surge in interest in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). These applications range from simple document classifcation to complex conversational chatbots. However, the uptake of LLMs has not been evenly distributed across society. Due to their large inference cost, only a few well-funded companies may afford to run LLMs at scale. To address this, many have turned to model compression to create smaller language models (LMs) with near comparable performance to their larger counterparts.\\nThe goal of model compression is to reduce a model\\u2019s size and latency while retaining overall performance. Existing approaches such as knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) have produced scalable task-agnostic models (Turc et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2020). Meanwhile, other approaches have shown that not all transformer heads (Michel et al., 2019) or embeddings (Gee et al., 2022) are essential. Although model compression has been proven to work well in practice, little is known about its infuence on subgroup robustness.\\n\\nIn any given dataset, subgroups exists as a combination of labels (e.g. hired or not hired) and attributes (e.g. male or female) (Sagawa et al., 2020; Bartlett et al., 2022). A model is said to be subgroup robust if it maximizes the lowest performance across subgroups (Gardner et al., 2023). Due to the unbalanced sample size of each subgroup, the conventional approach to training via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) (Vapnik, 1999) produces models with a higher performance on majority subgroups (e.g. hired male), but a lower performance on minority subgroups (e.g. hired female).\\n\\nGiven the increasing role of LLMs in everyday life, our work seeks to address a gap in the existing literature regarding the subgroup robustness of model compression in NLP. To that end, we explore a wide range of compression methods (Knowledge Distillation, Pruning, Quantization, and Vocabulary Transfer) and settings on 3 textual datasets \\u2014 MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018), CivilComments (Koh et al., 2021), and SCOTUS (Chalkidis et al., 2022). The code for our paper is publicly available1.\\nThe remaining paper is organized as follows. First, we review related works in Section 2. Then, we describe the experiments and results in Sections 3 and 4 respectively. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section 5.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"Most compression methods belong to one of the following categories: Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), Pruning (Han et al., 2015), or Quantization (Jacob et al., 2017). Additionally, there exists orthogonal approaches specifc to LMs such as Vocabulary Transfer (Gee et al., 2022). Previous works looking at the effects of model compression have focused on the classes or attributes in images.\\nHooker et al. (2021) analyzed the performance of compressed models on the imbalanced classes of CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA. Magnitude pruning and post-training quantization were considered with varying levels of sparsity and precision respectively. Model compression is found to cannibalize the performance on a small subset of classes to maintain overall performance.\\n\\nHooker et al. (2020) followed up by analyzing how model compression affects the performance on sensitive attributes of CelebA. Unitary attributes of gender and age as well as their intersections (e.g. Young Male) were considered. The authors found that overall performance was preserved by sacrifcing the performance on low-frequency attributes.\\nStoychev and Gunes (2022) expanded the previous analysis on attributes to the fairness of facial expression recognition. The authors found that compression does not always impact fairness in terms of gender, race, or age negatively. The impact of compression was also shown to be nonuniform across the different compression methods considered.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the frst to investigate the effects of model compression on subgroups in a NLP setting. Additionally, our analysis encompasses a much wider range of compression methods than were considered in the aforementioned works.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Models\",\"section_content\":\"We utilize 18 different compression methods and settings on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). An overview of each model\\u2019s size and parameters is shown in Table 1.\\nKnowledge Distillation (KD). We analyze seven models (BERTMedium, $\\\\mathtt{B E R T}_{S m a l l}$ $\\\\mathrm{BERT}_{M i n i}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{T i n y}$ , DistilBERT, $\\\\mathrm{TinyBERT_{6}}$ , $\\\\mathrm{TinyBERT_{4}}$ ) distilled from the uncased version of $\\\\mathrm{BERT}_{B a s e}$ using 3 different distillation methods (Turc et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2020). Each model is loaded from HuggingFace2 with its pre-trained weights.\\n\\nPruning. We analyze structured pruning (Michel et al., 2019) on BERT following a three-step training pipeline (Han et al., 2015). Four different levels of sparsity $(\\\\mathbf{BERT}_{P R20}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{P R40}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{P R60}$ , $\\\\mathbf{BERT}_{P R80})$ are applied by sorting all transformer heads using the L1-norm of weights from the query, key, and value projection matrices. Structured pruning is implemented using the NNI library3.\\nQuantization. We analyze 3 quantization methods supported natively by PyTorch \\u2014 Dynamic Quantization $(\\\\mathbf{BERT}_{D Q})$ , Static Quantization $({\\\\tt B E R T}_{S Q})$ ), and Quantization-aware Training $({\\\\tt B E R T}_{Q A T})$ . Quantization is applied to the linear layers of BERT to map representations from FP32 to INT8. The calibration required for $\\\\tt B E R T_{S Q}$ and $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{Q A T}$ is done using the training set.\\nVocabulary Transfer (VT). We analyze vocabulary transfer using 4 different vocabulary sizes $(\\\\mathbf{BERT}_{V T100}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{V T75}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{V T50}$ , $\\\\mathrm{BERT}_{V T25}\\\\$ ) as done by Gee et al. (2022). Note that $\\\\mathrm{BERT}_{V T100}$ does not compress the LM, but adapts its vocabulary fully to the in-domain dataset, thus making tokenization more effcient.\\nthe datasets to SCOTUS from the FairLex benchmark (Chalkidis et al., 2022).\\nFurther details regarding the subgroups in each dataset are shown in Appendix A.1.\\nMultiNLI. Given a hypothesis and premise, the task is to predict whether the hypothesis is contradicted by, entailed by, or neutral with the premise (Williams et al., 2018). Following Sagawa et al. (2020), the attribute indicates whether any negation words (nobody, no, never, or nothing) appear in the hypothesis. We use the same dataset splits as Liu et al. (2021).\\nCivilComments. Given an online comment, the task is to predict whether it is neutral or toxic (Koh et al., 2021). Following Koh et al. (2021), the attribute indicates whether any demographic identities (male, female, LGBTQ, Christian, Muslim, other religion, Black, or White) appear in the comment. We use the same dataset splits as Liu et al. (2021).\\nSCOTUS. Given a court opinion from the US Supreme Court, the task is to predict its thematic issue area (Chalkidis et al., 2022). Following Chalkidis et al. (2022), the attribute indicates the direction of the decision (liberal or conservative) as provided by the Supreme Court Database (SCDB). We use the same dataset splits as Chalkidis et al. (2022).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"In this work, we presented an analysis of existing compression methods on the subgroup robustness of LMs. We found that compression does not always harm the performance on minority subgroups.

Altogether, our analysis serves to further research into the subgroup robustness of model compression.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"In recent years, the feld of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen a surge in interest in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). These applications range from simple document classifcation to complex conversational chatbots. However, the uptake of LLMs has not been evenly distributed across society. Due to their large inference cost, only a few well-funded companies may afford to run LLMs at scale. To address this, many have turned to model compression to create smaller language models (LMs) with near comparable performance to their larger counterparts.\\nThe goal of model compression is to reduce a model\\u2019s size and latency while retaining overall performance. Existing approaches such as knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) have produced scalable task-agnostic models (Turc et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2020). Meanwhile, other approaches have shown that not all transformer heads (Michel et al., 2019) or embeddings (Gee et al., 2022) are essential. Although model compression has been proven to work well in practice, little is known about its infuence on subgroup robustness.\\n\\nIn any given dataset, subgroups exists as a combination of labels (e.g. hired or not hired) and attributes (e.g. male or female) (Sagawa et al., 2020; Bartlett et al., 2022). A model is said to be subgroup robust if it maximizes the lowest performance across subgroups (Gardner et al., 2023). Due to the unbalanced sample size of each subgroup, the conventional approach to training via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) (Vapnik, 1999) produces models with a higher performance on majority subgroups (e.g. hired male), but a lower performance on minority subgroups (e.g. hired female).\\n\\nGiven the increasing role of LLMs in everyday life, our work seeks to address a gap in the existing literature regarding the subgroup robustness of model compression in NLP. To that end, we explore a wide range of compression methods (Knowledge Distillation, Pruning, Quantization, and Vocabulary Transfer) and settings on 3 textual datasets \\u2014 MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018), CivilComments (Koh et al., 2021), and SCOTUS (Chalkidis et al., 2022). The code for our paper is publicly available1.\\nThe remaining paper is organized as follows. First, we review related works in Section 2. Then, we describe the experiments and results in Sections 3 and 4 respectively. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section 5.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"Most compression methods belong to one of the following categories: Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), Pruning (Han et al., 2015), or Quantization (Jacob et al., 2017). Additionally, there exists orthogonal approaches specifc to LMs such as Vocabulary Transfer (Gee et al., 2022). Previous works looking at the effects of model compression have focused on the classes or attributes in images.\\nHooker et al. (2021) analyzed the performance of compressed models on the imbalanced classes of CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and CelebA. Magnitude pruning and post-training quantization were considered with varying levels of sparsity and precision respectively. Model compression is found to cannibalize the performance on a small subset of classes to maintain overall performance.\\n\\nHooker et al. (2020) followed up by analyzing how model compression affects the performance on sensitive attributes of CelebA. Unitary attributes of gender and age as well as their intersections (e.g. Young Male) were considered. The authors found that overall performance was preserved by sacrifcing the performance on low-frequency attributes.\\nStoychev and Gunes (2022) expanded the previous analysis on attributes to the fairness of facial expression recognition. The authors found that compression does not always impact fairness in terms of gender, race, or age negatively. The impact of compression was also shown to be nonuniform across the different compression methods considered.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the frst to investigate the effects of model compression on subgroups in a NLP setting. Additionally, our analysis encompasses a much wider range of compression methods than were considered in the aforementioned works.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Models\",\"section_content\":\"We utilize 18 different compression methods and settings on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). An overview of each model\\u2019s size and parameters is shown in Table 1.\\nKnowledge Distillation (KD). We analyze seven models (BERTMedium, $\\\\mathtt{B E R T}_{S m a l l}$ $\\\\mathrm{BERT}_{M i n i}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{T i n y}$ , DistilBERT, $\\\\mathrm{TinyBERT_{6}}$ , $\\\\mathrm{TinyBERT_{4}}$ ) distilled from the uncased version of $\\\\mathrm{BERT}_{B a s e}$ using 3 different distillation methods (Turc et al., 2019; Sanh et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2020). Each model is loaded from HuggingFace2 with its pre-trained weights.\\n\\nPruning. We analyze structured pruning (Michel et al., 2019) on BERT following a three-step training pipeline (Han et al., 2015). Four different levels of sparsity $(\\\\mathbf{BERT}_{P R20}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{P R40}$ , $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{P R60}$ , $\\\\mathbf{BERT}_{P R80})$ are applied by sorting all transformer heads using the L1-norm of weights from the query, key, and value projection matrices. Structured pruning is implemented using the NNI library3.\\nQuantization. We analyze 3 quantization methods supported natively by PyTorch \\u2014 Dynamic Quantization $(\\\\mathbf{BERT}_{D Q})$ , Static Quantization $({\\\\tt B E R T}_{S Q})$ ), and Quantization-aware Training $({\\\\tt B E R T}_{Q A T})$ . Quantization is applied to the linear layers of BERT to map representations from FP32 to INT8. The calibration required for $\\\\tt B E R T_{S Q}$ and $\\\\mathsf{B E R T}_{Q A T}$ is done using the training set.\\nVocabulary Transfer (VT).

Given a hypothesis and premise, the task is to predict whether the hypothesis is contradicted by, entailed by, or neutral with the premise (Williams et al., 2018). Following Sagawa et al. (2020), the attribute indicates whether any negation words (nobody, no, never, or nothing) appear in the hypothesis. We use the same dataset splits as Liu et al. (2021).\\nCivilComments. Given an online comment, the task is to predict whether it is neutral or toxic (Koh et al., 2021). Following Koh et al. (2021), the attribute indicates whether any demographic identities (male, female, LGBTQ, Christian, Muslim, other religion, Black, or White) appear in the comment. We use the same dataset splits as Liu et al. (2021).\\nSCOTUS. Given a court opinion from the US Supreme Court, the task is to predict its thematic issue area (Chalkidis et al., 2022). Following Chalkidis et al. (2022), the attribute indicates the direction of the decision (liberal or conservative) as provided by the Supreme Court Database (SCDB).

(2022).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"In this work, we presented an analysis of existing compression methods on the subgroup robustness of LMs. We found that compression does not always harm the performance on minority subgroups.
