{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. IN THE RESPONSE, YOU SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN ONE TURN, THAT IS TO SAY, YOU SHOULD OUTPUT EXACTLY ONE THOUGHT AND ONTE ACTION. Now, let's start!\n"}

Given that our work focuses on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we select various task types that require reasoning abilities, including logical reasoning, mathematical reasoning, reading comprehension, and natural language inference (NLI). We also consider programbased reasoning (i.e., P-CoT) for math problem solving following Gao et al. (2023), where we execute the generated Python program to obtain the answer.\\nRegarding mathematical reasoning, we choose GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021), two widely used datasets. For the logical reasoning, we utilize the BoardgameQA (BGQA, Kazemi et al., 2023), which is a challenging reasoning task containing contradictory information from various sources. We select its \\u201cmain\\u201d subset and \\u201cconflict\\u201d subset. For NLI, we select the commonly used datasets SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018), and acquire their rationales from CoT-Collection (Kim et al., 2023). For reading comprehension, we choose race $@$ Middle and race $@$ High (Lai et al., 2017), two challenging reading comprehension tasks, and obtain their rationales from CoT-Collection (Kim et al., 2023).\\n\\nModels and baselines. For CoT reasoning, we choose Llama2-Base-7B (Touvron et al., 2023) as our backbone model because it is widely used. We include few-shot CoT, SFT and RL as our baselines. For P-CoT reasoning, we choose Llama2-Base-7B (Touvron et al., 2023), Glactica (Taylor et al., 2022), and Codellama-7B (Roziere et al., 2023) as our backbone. We include few-shot P-CoT, SFT and RL as baselines. We also consider recently proposed methods\\/models that require data augmentation, including MAmmoTH-Coder (7B & 34B, Yue et al., 2023), Tora and Tora-coder (7B & 13B, Gou et al., 2023).\\nImplementation details. Our training is done with eight A100-80GB GPUs and using DeepSpeed framework (Rasley et al., 2020). For few-shot CoT, we run five times with different demonstrations and report the average performance. For SFT, we set the learning rate to $2e\\\\mathrm{~-~}5$ . For each RL-related method, we first perform SFT to warm-up and then perform RL. We set the partial reward $\\\\epsilon$ to 0.1 for SVAMP and 0.2 for GSM8K. For CoT experiments, we set $\\\\beta$ to 0.05 in math reasoning and set $\\\\beta$ to 0.3 in other tasks; for P-CoT experiments, we set $\\\\beta$ to 0.01. For mathematical tasks, we perform 50 epochs for RL and report the best performance, including CoT and P-CoT. For other tasks, we perform 5 epochs for RL and report the best performance.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2. Experimental Results\",\"section_content\":\"Results on CoT reasoning. The main results are demonstrated in Table 2. Generally, we can find that: (1) RL methods consistently perform better than prompt-based methods and SFT, showing that by continuously performing exploration and learning, models can refine their reasoning capabilities over time, similar to (Luo et al., 2023). (2) ${\\\\bf R}^{3}$ outperforms other baselines in all tasks, with an average improvement of 5.4 over SFT and 4.1 over RL, indicating that our method can provide stable and significant optimization. However, staged RL is only a bit better than the RL baseline, possibly due to overfitting and ineffective stage-to-stage adaptation mentioned before.\\nSpecifically, our method can enhance different reasoning ability of models. For example, on mathematical tasks, ${\\\\bf R}^{3}$ shows significant improvements compared to SFT and RL Baselines, suggesting that our method effectively helps models to acquire and refine structured and formal reasoning abilities through exploration. Our method also allows models to handle reasoning tasks with contradictory information (BGQA), demonstrating a notable enhancement in their defeasible reasoning ability (i.e., reasoning with conflicting information guided by preference, Pollock, 1987; Hecham et al., 2018; Maher et al., 2020).\\n\\nResults on P-CoT reasoning. The evaluating results on program-based reasoning is shown in table 3. We can find that: (1) ${\\\\bf R}^{3}$ outperforms other baselines on P-CoT reasoning across all three models. On average, it exceeds SFT by 11.4 points and surpasses the RL Baseline by 4.2 points. This demonstrates that our method is not only highly effective but also versatile and adaptable, capable of extending to various reasoning styles like programs. (2) Compared to other methods that require data augmentation, e.g., MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2023), Tora and Tora-code (Gou et al., 2023), Codellama- $\\\\cdot7\\\\mathrm{B}+\\\\mathrm{R}^{3}$ achieves the better results in 7Bsized models and matches up well with larger models and closed-source model GPT-3.5-Turbo. (3) When our method is applied to models like Tora and Tora-code, which were trained with additional data during SFT, it still yields significant performance gain using only the original data in the reinforcement learning phase, demonstrating its adaptability and wide applicability.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"B.
