{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

These models undergo training on extensive internet datasets, enabling them to capture a\\nwide range of concepts, which inevitably include undesirable concepts such as racism, sexism, and\\nviolence. Hence, these models can be exploited by users to generate harmful content, contributing to\\nthe proliferation of fake news, hate speech, and disinformation (Rando et al., 2022; Qu et al., 2023;\\nWesterlund, 2019). Removing these undesirable contents from the model\\u2019s output is thus a critical\\nstep in ensuring the safety and usefulness of these models.\\nAddressing this challenge, several methods have been proposed to erase undesirable concepts from\\npretrained text-to-image models, such as TIME (Orgad et al., 2023), UCE (Zhang et al., 2023),\\nConcept Ablation (Kumari et al., 2023), and ESD (Gandikota et al., 2023). Despite differing\\napproaches, these methods reach a common finding: removing even one concept can significantly\\nreduce the model\\u2019s ability to generate other concepts. This is because large-scale generative models\\nG : C \\u2192X, such as Stable Diffusion (StabilityAI, 2022), are trained on billions of image-text pairs\\n(x, c), where x is an image and c is its caption, implicitly containing a set of concepts. The concept\\nspace is thus vast and intricately entangled within the model\\u2019s parameters, meaning no specific part\\nof the model\\u2019s weights is solely responsible for a single concept. Consequently, the removal of one\\nconcept alters the entire model\\u2019s parameters, causing a decline in overall performance. To address\\nthis degradation, existing methods typically select a neutral concept, such as \\\"a photo\\\" or an empty\\nstring, as an anchor to preserve while erasing the target concept, expecting that maintaining the\\nneutral concept should help retain other concepts as well Orgad et al. (2023); Gandikota et al. (2024).\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nWhile choosing a neutral concept is reasonable, we argue that it is not the optimal choice and may not\\nguarantee the preservation of the model performance. In this paper, we propose to shift the attention\\ntowards the adversarial concepts, those most affected by changes in model parameters. This approach\\nensures that erasing unwanted content is stable and minimally impacts other concepts. To summarize,\\nour key contributions are two-fold:\\n\\u2022 We empirically investigate the impact of unlearning the target concept on the generation of\\nother concepts. Our findings show that erasing different target concepts affects the remaining\\nones in various ways. This raises the question of whether preserving a neutral concept is\\nsufficient to maintain the model\\u2019s capability. We discover that the neutral concept lies in the\\nmiddle of the sensitivity spectrum, whereas related concepts such as \\\"person\\\" and \\\"women\\\"\\nare more sensitive to the target concept \\\"nudity\\\" than many neutral concepts. Additionally,\\nwe demonstrate that selecting the appropriate concepts to preserve significantly improves\\nquality retention.\\n\\u2022 We propose a novel method to identify the most sensitive concepts corresponding to the\\nconcept targeted to be erased, and then preserve these sensitive concepts explicitly to\\nmaintain the model\\u2019s capability.

(2023); Orgad et al.\\n(2023); Gandikota et al. (2024) is to optimize the following objective function:\\nmin\\n\\u03b8\\u2032\\nEce\\u2208E\\nh\\n\\u2225\\u03f5\\u03b8\\u2032 (ce) \\u2212\\u03f5\\u03b8(cn)\\u22252\\n2\\ni\\n(3)\\nFundamentally, these methods aim to force the model output, associated with the to-be-erased\\nconcepts, to approximate the model output associated with a neutral or null input cn (e.g., \\\"a photo\\\"\\nor \\\" \\\"). Ideally, when erasing a concept, we would like to preserve all the remaining ones. This\\nwould corresponding to optimizing the above objective for all possible concepts in C \\\\ E, which is\\nexcessively expensive. Hence, using a neutral concept as proxy first seems as a convenient strategy.\\nWhile this naive approach is effective in erasing the specific concept, it however has a negative\\nimpact on the model\\u2019s capacity to preserve other concepts related to the to-be-erased concepts. For\\nexample, easing the concept \\\"nudity\\\" affects the quality of images of \\\"woman\\\" or \\\"person\\\". To\\nmitigate this issue, prior works have proposed to use either an additional loss term to retain the null\\nconcept Gandikota et al. (2023) or a regularization term to prevent excessive change in the model\\nparameters Orgad et al. (2023). However, these regularization attempts clearly have not addressed the\\ncore trade-off between erasing a concept and preserving the others.\\n3.2\\nImpact of Concept Removal on the Model Performance\\nWe here approach the problem more carefully via a study on the impact of erasing a specific concept\\non model performance on the remaining ones. More importantly, we are concerned with the most\\nsensitive concepts to erasure. For example, when removing the concept of \\\"nudity\\\", we are curious to\\nknow which concepts change the most in the model\\u2019s output, so that we can preserve these concepts\\nspecifically to ensure the model\\u2019s capability is maintained, at least with respect to these concepts.\\nFor some concepts, we can make an intuitive guess. For example, the concept of \\\"nudity\\\" is closely\\nrelated to the concepts of \\\"women\\\" and \\\"men\\\", which are likely to be affected by the removal of the\\nconcept of \\\"nudity\\\". However, for most concepts, it is not easy to determine which ones are most\\nsensitive to the target concept. Therefore, in prior works, selecting a neutral one like a \\u2018photo\\u2019 or \\\" \\\"\\nregardless of the target concepts is clearly not a sound solution. We next provide empirical evidence\\nto support this argument.\\nMeasuring Generation Capability with CLIP Alignment Score.\\nGiven a target concept ce, e.g.,\\n\\\"nudity\\\" or \\\"garbage truck\\\", from that we obtain the original model \\u03f5\\u03b8 and the sanitized model \\u03f5\\u03b8\\u2032\\nce\\nby removing the target concept ce. We have a set of concepts C = {c1, c2, . . . , c|C|}, where |C| is the\\nnumber of concepts. Our goal is to measure the impact of unlearning ce on the generation of other\\nconcepts c in C.\\n3\\nFigure 2: Sensitivity spectrum of concepts to the target concept \\\"nudity\\\". The histogram shows the\\ndistribution of the similarity score between outputs of the original model \\u03b8 and the corresponding\\nsanitized model \\u03b8\\u2032\\nce for each concept c from the CLIP tokenizer vocabulary.\\nTo\\nachieve\\nthis,\\nwe\\ngenerate\\na\\nlarge\\nnumber\\nof\\nsamples\\nfrom\\nboth\\nmodels,\\ni.e.,\\n{G(\\u03b8, c, zi\\nT )}k\\ni=1, {G(\\u03b8\\u2032\\nce, c, zi\\nT )}k\\ni=1 for k = 200 samples for each concept c \\u2208C. We then calculate\\nthe CLIP alignment score S\\u03b8,i,c = S(G(\\u03b8, c, zi\\nT ), c) between the generated samples and the textual\\ndescription of the concepts c (CLIP model \\u2018openai\\/clip-vit-base-patch14\\u2019). A higher CLIP alignment\\nscore indicates that the generated samples are more similar to the concept c, and vice versa. Thus, we\\ncan use the CLIP alignment score as a metric to evaluate the capability of the model to generate the\\nconcept c, and the change of this score between the two models, \\u03b4ce(c) = 1\\nk\\nPk\\ni=1\\n\\u0010\\nS\\u03b8,i,c \\u2212S\\u03b8\\u2032\\nce,i,c\\n\\u0011\\nindicates the impact of unlearning ce on generating the concept c. The discussion on the metric is\\nprovided in Appendix B.3.\\nThe Removal of Different Target Concepts Leads to Different Side-Effects.\\nFigure 1a shows\\nthe impact of the removal of two distinct concepts, \\\"nudity\\\" and \\\"garbage truck\\\", on other concepts,\\nmeasured by the difference of the CLIP score, \\u03b4\\u2019nudity\\u2019(c), \\u03b4\\u2019garbage truck\\u2019(c). A larger \\u03b4(c) indicates a\\ngreater negative impact on the model\\u2019s ability to generate concept c.\\nIt can be seen that removing the \\\"nudity\\\" concept significantly affects highly related concepts such as\\n\\\"naked\\\", \\\"men\\\", \\\"women\\\", and \\\"person\\\", while having minimal impact on unrelated concepts such as\\n\\\"garbage truck\\\", \\u2019bamboo\\u2019 or neutral concepts such as \\\"a photo\\\" or the null \\\" \\\" concept. Similarly,\\nremoving the \\\"garbage truck\\\" concept significantly reduces the model\\u2019s capability on concepts like\\n\\\"boat\\\", \\\"car\\\", \\\"bus\\\", while also having little impact on other unrelated concepts such as \\\"naked\\\",\\n\\\"women\\\" or neutral concepts.\\nThese results suggest that removing different target concepts leads to varying impacts on other\\nconcepts. This indicates the need for an adaptive method to identify the most sensitive concepts\\nrelative to a particular target concept, rather than relying on random or fixed concepts for preservation.\\nMoreover, in both cases, neutral concepts like \\\"a photo\\\" or the null concept show resilience and\\nindependence from changes in the model\\u2019s parameters, suggesting that they do not adequately\\nrepresent the model\\u2019s capability to be preserved.\\nNeutral Concepts lie in the Middle of the Sensitivity Spectrum.\\nFigure 2 shows the distribution\\nof similarity scores between the outputs of the original model \\u03b8 and the sanitized model \\u03b8\\u2032\\nce for each\\nconcept c from the CLIP tokenizer vocabulary. The histogram reveals that the similarity scores span\\na wide range, indicating that the impact of unlearning the target concept on generating other concepts\\nvaries significantly. The lower the similarity score, the more different the outputs of the two models\\nare, and the more sensitive the concept is to the target concept. Notably, the more related concepts\\nlike \\\"women\\\" or \\\"men\\\" are more sensitive to the removal of \\\"nudity\\\" than many neutral concepts that\\nlie in the middle of the sensitivity spectrum.\\n4\\nFigure 3: Comparing the impact of erasing the same \\\"nudity\\\" to other concepts with different\\npreserving strategies.\\nWhat Concept should be Kept to Maintain Model Performance.\\nFigure 1b presents the results\\nof an experiment similar to the previous one, with one key difference: we utilize the prior knowledge\\ngained from the previous experiment. Specifically, when erasing the \\\"garbage truck\\\", we apply\\ndifferent preservation strategies, including preserving a fixed concept such as \\\" \\\", \\\"lexus\\\", or \\\"road\\\",\\nand adaptively preserving the most sensitive concept found by our method.\\nThe results show that with simple preservation strategies such as preserving a fixed but related concept\\nlike \\\"road\\\", the model\\u2019s capability on other concepts is better maintained compared to preserving\\na neutral concept. However, the results of adaptively preserving the most sensitive concept show\\nthe best performance, with the least side effects on other concepts. Similarly, the results of erasing\\nthe \\\"nudity\\\" concept as shown in Figure 3 show that preserving related concepts like \\\"person\\\" helps\\nretain the model\\u2019s capability on other concepts much better than preserving a neutral concept. These\\nfindings confirm the importance of selecting sensitive concepts to preserve in order to better maintain\\nthe model\\u2019s overall capability.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
