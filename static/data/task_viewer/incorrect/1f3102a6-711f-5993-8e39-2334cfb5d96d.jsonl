{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

For held-in evaluation, we compute the average\\nscore of four datasets, including COCO Caption, OKVQA, A-OKVQA, and TextCaps. For held-out\\nevaluation, we show five datasets from different tasks.\\n3.2\\nAblation Study on Instruction Tuning Techniques\\nTo investigate the impact of the instruction-aware visual feature extraction (Section 2.3) and the\\nbalanced dataset sampling strategy (Section 2.4), we conduct ablation studies during the instruction\\ntuning process. As illustrated in Table 2, the removal of instruction awareness in visual features\\ndowngrades performance significantly across all datasets. The performance drop is more severe\\nin datasets that involve spatial visual reasoning (e.g., ScienceQA) or temporal visual reasoning\\n(e.g., iVQA), where the instruction input to the Q-Former can guide visual features to attend to\\ninformative image regions. The removal of the data balancing strategy causes unstable and uneven\\ntraining, as different datasets achieve peak performance at drastically different training steps. The\\nlack of synchronized progress over multiple datasets harms the overall performance.\\n3.3\\nQualitative Evaluation\\nBesides the systematic evaluation on public benchmarks, we further qualitatively examine Instruct-\\nBLIP with more diverse images and instructions. As illustrated in Figure 1, InstructBLIP demonstrates\\nits capacity for complex visual reasoning. For example, it can reasonably infer from the visual scene\\nwhat could have happened and deduce the type of disaster from the location of the scene, which\\nit extrapolates based on visual evidence like the palm trees. Moreover, InstructBLIP is capable\\nof connecting visual input with embedded textual knowledge and generate informative responses,\\nsuch as intruducing a famous painting. Furthermore, in descriptions of the overall atmosphere,\\nInstructBLIP exhibits the ability to comprehend metaphorical implications of the visual imagery.\\n7\\n40\\n45\\n50\\n55\\n46.1\\n46.3\\n45.5\\n46.8\\n52.9\\n60\\n75\\n90\\n105\\n67.8\\n92.5\\n89.0\\n93.7\\n93.8\\nBLIP-2 Zero-shot\\nTrain w\\/ Plain Input\\nEval w\\/ Instruction\\nTrain w\\/ Dataset Name\\nEval w\\/ Instruction\\nTrain w\\/ Dataset Name\\nEval w\\/ Dataset Name\\nInstructBLIP\\nMulti-task\\nHeld-out Avg.\\nHeld-in Avg.\\nFigure 4: Comparison of instruction tuning and multitask training based on BLIP-2 FlanT5XL\\nbackbone. For held-in evaluation, we compute the average score across all held-in datasets. For\\nheld-out evaluation, we compute the average score across GQA, TextVQA, VSR, HatefulMemes,\\nIconQA, ScienceQA, iVQA, VizWiz.\\nFinally, we show that InstructBLIP can engage in multi-turn conversations, effectively considering\\nthe dialog history when making new responses.\\nIn Appendix B, we qualitatively compare InstructBLIP with concurrent multimodal models (GPT-\\n4 [36], LLaVA [28], MiniGPT-4 [37]). Although all models are capable of generating long-form\\nresponses, InstructBLIP\\u2019s outputs generally contains more proper visual details and exhibits logically\\ncoherent reasoning steps. Importantly, we argue that long-form responses are not always preferable.\\nFor example, in Figure 2 of the Appendix, InstructBLIP directly addresses the user\\u2019s intent by\\nadaptively adjusting the response length, while LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 generate long and less\\nrelevant sentences. These advantages of InstructBLIP are a result of the diverse instruction tuning\\ndata and an effective architectural design.\\n3.4\\nInstruction Tuning vs. Multitask Learning\\nA direct analogue to instruction tuning is multitask learning, a widely used method that involves\\nthe simultaneous training of multiple datasets with the goal of improving the performance of each\\nindividual dataset. To investigate whether the improvement in zero-shot generalization mainly comes\\nfrom the instruction format or merely from multi-task learning, we conduct a comparative analysis.\\nFollowing [1], we consider two multitask training approaches. In the first approach, the model is\\ntrained using the vanilla input-output format of the training datasets without instructions. During\\nevaluation, instructions are still provided to the model to specify which task to perform. However,\\nan exception is made for image captioning, as the model performs better when receiving the image\\nas the only input. For the second approach, we take a step toward instruction tuning by prepending\\na [Task:Dataset] identifier to the text input during training. For example, we prepend [Visual\\nquestion answering:VQAv2] for the VQAv2 dataset. During evaluation, we explore both instruc-\\ntions and the identifier. Particularly, for held-out datasets, we only use the task name as the identifier\\nsince the model never sees the dataset name.\\nIn Figure 4, we show the results for zero-shot, multitask training, and instruction tuning. All models\\nare based on the BLIP-2 FlanT5XL backbone and adhere to the identical training configurations in\\nSection 2. Overall, we make two observations. First, instruction tuning and multitask learning exhibit\\nsimilar performance on the held-in datasets. This suggests that the model can fit these two different\\ninput patterns comparably well, as long as it has been trained with such data. Second, instruction\\ntuning yields a significant improvement over multitask learning on unseen held-out datasets, whereas\\nmultitask learning performs on par with the original BLIP-2. This indicates that instruction tuning is\\nthe key to zero-shot generalization.\\n8\\nScienceQA\\n(image-context)\\nOCR-VQA\\nOKVQA\\nA-OKVQA\\nDirect Answer\\nMulti-choice\\nVal\\nTest\\nVal\\nTest\\nPrevious SOTA\\nLLaVA [28]\\n89.0\\nGIT [39]\\n70.3\\nPaLM-E (562B) [38]\\n66.1\\n[40]\\n56.3\\n[41]\\n61.6\\n[40]\\n73.2\\n[41]\\n73.6\\nBLIP-2 (FlanT5XXL)\\n89.5\\n72.7\\n54.7\\n57.6\\n53.7\\n80.2\\n76.2\\nInstructBLIP (FlanT5XXL)\\n90.7\\n73.3\\n55.5\\n57.1\\n54.8\\n81.0\\n76.7\\nBLIP-2 (Vicuna-7B)\\n77.3\\n69.1\\n59.3\\n60.0\\n58.7\\n72.1\\n69.0\\nInstructBLIP (Vicuna-7B)\\n79.5\\n72.8\\n62.1\\n64.0\\n62.1\\n75.7\\n73.4\\nTable 3: Results of finetuning BLIP-2 and InstructBLIP on downstream datasets.

Compared to most previous methods (e.g., Flamingo, BLIP-2) which increase the input\\nimage resolution and finetune the visual encoder on downstream tasks, InstructBLIP maintains the\\nsame image resolution (224\\u00d7224) as used in instruction tuning and keeps the visual encoder frozen\\nduring finetuning. This significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters from 1.2B to 188M,\\nthus greatly improves finetuning efficiency.\\nThe results are in Table 3. Compared to BLIP-2, InstructBLIP leads to better finetuning performance\\non all datasets, validating InstructBLIP as the better initialization for task-specific finetuning. Instruct-\\nBLIP sets new state-of-the-art finetuning performance on ScienceQA (image-context), OCR-VQA,\\nA-OKVQA, but is outperformed on OKVQA by PaLM-E [38] with 562B parameters.\\nAdditionally, we observe that the FlanT5-based InstructBLIP is superior at multi-choice tasks,\\nwhereas Vicuna-based InstructBLIP is generally better at open-ended generation tasks. This disparity\\ncan be primarily attributed to the capabilities of their frozen LLMs, as they both employ the same\\nimage encoder. Although FlanT5 and Vicuna are both instruction-tuned LLMs, their instruction data\\nsignificantly differ. FlanT5 is mainly finetuned on NLP benchmarks containing many multi-choice\\nQA and classification datasets, while Vicuna is finetuned on open-ended instruction-following data.\\n4\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

The default configuration, which obtains the best results, uses the\\nnavigation goal, velocity, and acceleration as ego status inputs. Its camera FOV is around 140\\u25e6and\\nLiDAR range is 32m to the front (F), back (B), left (L), and right (R). It uses both auxiliary tasks.\\nthe same architecture as TransFuser but replaces the LiDAR input with a learned embedding, hence\\nrequiring only camera inputs. Moreover, we provide two state-of-the-art end-to-end architectures\\nfor open-loop trajectory prediction on nuScenes. (5) UniAD [21] incorporates a wide range of tasks,\\nsuch as mapping, tracking, motion, and occupancy prediction in a semi-sequential architecture, which\\nprocesses feature representations through several transformer decoders culminating in a trajectory\\nplanning module. (6) PARA-Drive [50] uses the same auxiliary tasks, but parallelizes the network\\narchitecture, such that the auxiliary task heads are trained in parallel with a shared encoder. Both\\nUniAD and PARA-Drive use a BEVFormer backbone [31], which encodes the eight surround-\\nview 1920 \\u00d7 1080 camera images over four temporal frames into a BEV feature representation.\\nImplementation details for all methods are provided in the supplementary material.\\nResults. We show our results on navtest in Table 1. The Constant Velocity model is a lower\\nbound, as the agent is used to identify trivial driving scenes excluded from the benchmark. The Ego\\nStatus MLP achieves a PDMS of 65.6, showing the value of the acceleration and navigation goal for\\navoiding collisions and driving off-road. However, we observe a clear gap between agents relying\\nsolely on the ego status and those considering sensor data, in contrast to results on nuScenes [32]. All\\nsensor agents achieve a PDMS of over 83, where TransFuser and PARA-Drive marginally perform\\nbest, with a PDMS of 84.0. Surprisingly, the camera-only LTF achieves similar results (83.8). UniAD\\nreaches a PDMS of 83.4, which, together with PARA-Drive, do not surpass the performance of\\nTransFuser and LTF, despite the need for more demanding training, e.g., 80 GPUs for 3 days to train\\nPARA-Drive versus 1 GPU for 1 day for TransFuser on the navtrain split. Due to the definition\\nof at-fault collisions, which discard certain rear-collisions into the ego vehicle, we suspect that\\nsurround-view cameras used by UniAD and PARA-Drive, and LiDAR input of TransFuser, are less\\nimportant than the wide-angle front camera which is the only input of LTF. The 10 PDMS discrepancy\\nto the human operator demonstrates that navtest poses challenges even to well-studied end-to-end\\narchitectures. Specifically, the drivable area compliance (DAC) and ego progress (EP) subscores\\nremain the most challenging. Notably, EP cannot be solved purely by human imitation, given that the\\nmaximum progress estimate used for normalization is based on a privileged rule-based motion planner.\\nInterestingly, all agents achieve near-perfect comfort scores, indicating that smooth acceleration and\\njerk profiles are learned naturally from human imitation.\\nAnalyzing TransFuser. In Table 2, we compare several training settings for TransFuser. For\\nthe three training seeds in configs A1-A3, we observe a standard deviation of \\u00b1 0.56 in PDMS,\\nwhich is relatively small compared to variance among training seeds for closed-loop simulations in\\nCARLA [17]. Further, unlike CARLA, NAVSIM is deterministic, and we obtain identical scores\\nwhen repeating evaluations of a deterministic driving agent. Discarding velocity and acceleration\\n(B1) lowers PDMS by 1.5 \\u22122.6, whereas only removing the acceleration (B2) lowers the score by\\n1.0 \\u22122.1. We conclude that while TransFuser benefits from the ego status, it is not purely relying\\non the kinematic state for planning. Next, only considering the front camera (C1) with a 60\\u25e6FOV\\nleads to a small drop in almost all subscores, compared to our default setting of three cropped and\\n8\\nconcatenated images with a FOV of 140\\u25e6. However, expanding the FOV with additional cameras\\ndoes not result in substantially improved scores. Interestingly, restricting the LiDAR range to 16m\\nin all directions (D1), results in a score of 79, which is lower than dropping LiDAR altogether (see\\nLTF in Table 1). Expanding the LiDAR range to 64m in the forward direction (D2) or all directions\\n(D3) does not provide significant improvements. We suspect that changes in the LiDAR range overly\\nsimplify or complicate the auxiliary 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation tasks, which\\noperate in the LiDAR coordinate frame, hindering effective imitation learning. We check the impact\\nof the auxiliary tasks by excluding them, where performance drops without BEV Segmentation (E1).\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nPDM Score\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n#Teams\\nConstant Velocity\\nTransFuser\\nFigure 5: NAVSIM Challenge.\\nCVPR 2024 NAVSIM Challenge.

As a lower bound, we consider the (1) Constant Velocity baseline detailed in Section 3.1.\\nWe include an (2) Ego Status MLP as a second \\\"blind\\\" agent, which leverages an MLP for trajectory\\nprediction given only the ego velocity, acceleration and navigation goal. As an established architecture\\non CARLA, we evaluate our reimplementation of (3) TransFuser [12], which uses three cropped\\nand downscaled forward-facing cameras, concatenated into a 1024 \\u00d7 256 image, and a rasterized\\nBEV LiDAR input for predicting waypoints. It performs 3D object detection and BEV semantic\\nsegmentation as auxiliary tasks. We then consider (4) Latent TransFuser (LTF) [12], which shares\\n7\\nConfig\\nParameter\\nSetting\\nNC \\u2191\\nDAC \\u2191\\nTTC \\u2191\\nComf. \\u2191\\nEP \\u2191\\nPDMS \\u2191\\nA1\\nDefault config\\nSeed 1\\n98.0\\n91.3\\n94.2\\n100\\n78.1\\n83.3\\nA2\\nSeed 2\\n97.7\\n92.8\\n92.8\\n100\\n79.2\\n84.0\\nA3\\nSeed 3\\n97.9\\n93.0\\n93.1\\n100\\n79.3\\n84.4\\nB1\\nEgo status\\nGoal only\\n96.8\\n91.9\\n91.3\\n98.6\\n77.3\\n81.8\\nB2\\nGoal and velocity only\\n96.7\\n92.3\\n91.0\\n100\\n77.8\\n82.3\\nC1\\nCamera FOV\\n60\\u25e6(1 camera)\\n96.7\\n90.2\\n90.9\\n100\\n75.8\\n80.3\\nC2\\n160\\u25e6(3 cameras)\\n97.6\\n91.4\\n92.7\\n100\\n78.1\\n82.8\\nC3\\n240\\u25e6(5 cameras)\\n97.8\\n92.5\\n93.0\\n100\\n79.2\\n84.1\\nD1\\nLiDAR range\\nF:16, B:16, L:16, R:16\\n96.9\\n88.3\\n91.2\\n100\\n74.6\\n79.1\\nD2\\nF:64, B:32, L:32, R:32\\n97.8\\n92.7\\n93.4\\n100\\n79.3\\n84.3\\nD3\\nF:64, B:64, L:64, R:64\\n96.8\\n90.3\\n91.5\\n100\\n76.5\\n81.0\\nE1\\nSupervision\\nNo BEV segmentation\\n97.4\\n90.5\\n92.2\\n100\\n77.1\\n81.6\\nE2\\nNo 3D detection\\n97.8\\n92.7\\n92.9\\n100\\n79.2\\n84.0\\nTable 2: TransFuser Ablations. The default configuration, which obtains the best results, uses the\\nnavigation goal, velocity, and acceleration as ego status inputs. Its camera FOV is around 140\\u25e6and\\nLiDAR range is 32m to the front (F), back (B), left (L), and right (R). It uses both auxiliary tasks.\\nthe same architecture as TransFuser but replaces the LiDAR input with a learned embedding, hence\\nrequiring only camera inputs. Moreover, we provide two state-of-the-art end-to-end architectures\\nfor open-loop trajectory prediction on nuScenes. (5) UniAD [21] incorporates a wide range of tasks,\\nsuch as mapping, tracking, motion, and occupancy prediction in a semi-sequential architecture, which\\nprocesses feature representations through several transformer decoders culminating in a trajectory\\nplanning module. (6) PARA-Drive [50] uses the same auxiliary tasks, but parallelizes the network\\narchitecture, such that the auxiliary task heads are trained in parallel with a shared encoder. Both\\nUniAD and PARA-Drive use a BEVFormer backbone [31], which encodes the eight surround-\\nview 1920 \\u00d7 1080 camera images over four temporal frames into a BEV feature representation.\\nImplementation details for all methods are provided in the supplementary material.\\nResults. We show our results on navtest in Table 1. The Constant Velocity model is a lower\\nbound, as the agent is used to identify trivial driving scenes excluded from the benchmark. The Ego\\nStatus MLP achieves a PDMS of 65.6, showing the value of the acceleration and navigation goal for\\navoiding collisions and driving off-road. However, we observe a clear gap between agents relying\\nsolely on the ego status and those considering sensor data, in contrast to results on nuScenes [32]. All\\nsensor agents achieve a PDMS of over 83, where TransFuser and PARA-Drive marginally perform\\nbest, with a PDMS of 84.0. Surprisingly, the camera-only LTF achieves similar results (83.8). UniAD\\nreaches a PDMS of 83.4, which, together with PARA-Drive, do not surpass the performance of\\nTransFuser and LTF, despite the need for more demanding training, e.g., 80 GPUs for 3 days to train\\nPARA-Drive versus 1 GPU for 1 day for TransFuser on the navtrain split. Due to the definition\\nof at-fault collisions, which discard certain rear-collisions into the ego vehicle, we suspect that\\nsurround-view cameras used by UniAD and PARA-Drive, and LiDAR input of TransFuser, are less\\nimportant than the wide-angle front camera which is the only input of LTF. The 10 PDMS discrepancy\\nto the human operator demonstrates that navtest poses challenges even to well-studied end-to-end\\narchitectures. Specifically, the drivable area compliance (DAC) and ego progress (EP) subscores\\nremain the most challenging. Notably, EP cannot be solved purely by human imitation, given that the\\nmaximum progress estimate used for normalization is based on a privileged rule-based motion planner.\\nInterestingly, all agents achieve near-perfect comfort scores, indicating that smooth acceleration and\\njerk profiles are learned naturally from human imitation.\\nAnalyzing TransFuser. In Table 2, we compare several training settings for TransFuser. For\\nthe three training seeds in configs A1-A3, we observe a standard deviation of \\u00b1 0.56 in PDMS,\\nwhich is relatively small compared to variance among training seeds for closed-loop simulations in\\nCARLA [17]. Further, unlike CARLA, NAVSIM is deterministic, and we obtain identical scores\\nwhen repeating evaluations of a deterministic driving agent. Discarding velocity and acceleration\\n(B1) lowers PDMS by 1.5 \\u22122.6, whereas only removing the acceleration (B2) lowers the score by\\n1.0 \\u22122.1. We conclude that while TransFuser benefits from the ego status, it is not purely relying\\non the kinematic state for planning. Next, only considering the front camera (C1) with a 60\\u25e6FOV\\nleads to a small drop in almost all subscores, compared to our default setting of three cropped and\\n8\\nconcatenated images with a FOV of 140\\u25e6. However, expanding the FOV with additional cameras\\ndoes not result in substantially improved scores. Interestingly, restricting the LiDAR range to 16m\\nin all directions (D1), results in a score of 79, which is lower than dropping LiDAR altogether (see\\nLTF in Table 1). Expanding the LiDAR range to 64m in the forward direction (D2) or all directions\\n(D3) does not provide significant improvements. We suspect that changes in the LiDAR range overly\\nsimplify or complicate the auxiliary 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation tasks, which\\noperate in the LiDAR coordinate frame, hindering effective imitation learning. We check the impact\\nof the auxiliary tasks by excluding them, where performance drops without BEV Segmentation (E1).\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nPDM Score\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n#Teams\\nConstant Velocity\\nTransFuser\\nFigure 5: NAVSIM Challenge.\\nCVPR 2024 NAVSIM Challenge. We organized the inaugu-\\nral NAVSIM challenge which ran from March - May 2024.\\nTo ensure integrity, we used a private dataset and only gave\\nparticipants access to sensor inputs, withholding all annota-\\ntions. Competitors could submit their agent\\u2019s trajectories to\\nour leaderboard, where they were simulated and scored to ob-\\ntain the PDMS. We received 463 submissions from 143 teams,\\nof which 78 submissions were made publicly visible. We sum-\\nmarize their scores in Fig. 5, relative to the constant velocity\\nand TransFuser baselines from Table 1. The winning entry\\nextended TransFuser and learned to predict proxy subscores\\nfor trajectory samples [30], with a sampling strategy inspired\\nby VADv2 [10]. These predicted subscores were weighted\\nalongside a human imitation score to select the output plan. While the idea of sampling and scoring\\ntrajectories is well-known [46, 51, 55, 6, 16], it has recently been overlooked in favor of approaches\\nwhich predict a single trajectory. This result prompts a reassessment of such methods. The team that\\nplaced second employed a vision language model (VLM) for driving, which is rapidly emerging as\\na sub-field in the AV literature [45, 33, 53, 58]. Several submissions attempted to reimplement or\\nextend prior work on nuScenes such as UniAD [21] and VAD [25], but were unable to outperform the\\nTransFuser baseline by the challenge submission deadline, given the significant engineering challenge\\nand compute requirements. The diversity of the solutions on the leaderboard shows the potential\\nof NAVSIM as a framework for pushing the frontiers of autonomous driving research.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term. The detailed\\nresults are presented in Figure 9.\\nOur findings reveal that increasing the number of diffusion steps primarily enhances behavior en-\\ntropy, signifying an improvement in the model\\u2019s capacity to capture multi-modalities. However,\\nfor BeT and VAE-ACT, we did not observe a consistent trend indicating a correlation between the\\nparameters and success rate or entropy.\\nInference Time Comparison.

(a) For each planner, we show open-loop metrics (OLS, PDMS)\\ntogether with the corresponding closed-loop score (CLS). The trendlines depicting correlations are fit\\nlinearly to all (learned and rule-based) planners. Moreover, we analyze different (b) CLS durations d,\\n(c) planning frequencies f, (d) PDMS horizons h, and (e) closed-loop background agent behaviors.\\n4.1\\nAlignment Between Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Evaluation\\nOpen-loop metrics should ideally be aligned with closed-loop metrics in their evaluation of different\\ndriving algorithms. In this section, we benchmark a large set of planners to analyze the alignment of\\nclosed-loop metrics with traditional distance-based open-loop metrics and the proposed PDMS.\\nBenchmark. Studying the relation of closed-loop and open-loop metrics necessitates access to a\\nfully reactive simulator. To stay compatible with the dataset, we use the nuPlan simulator [26], which\\nenables simulation for privileged planners with access to ground-truth perception and HD map inputs.\\nSimilar to PDMS, nuPlan combines weighted averages and multiplied penalties in two official scores:\\nthe open-loop score (OLS) aggregates displacement and heading errors with a multiplied miss-rate,\\nand the closed-loop score (CLS) implements similar metrics from Section 3. Including PDMS, all\\nmetrics are in [0, 1] with higher scores indicating better performance.\\nDue to the heavy computational requirements of closed-loop simulation, we evaluate on the navmini\\nsplit. This is a new split we create for rapid testing, with 396 scenarios in total that are independent of\\nboth navtrain and navtest but filtered using the same strategy (Section 3.1) and hence similarly\\ndistributed. We note that nuPlan offers two kinds of background agents: reactive agents along lane\\ncenters based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [48], and non-reactive agents replayed from the\\ndataset, which we employ unless otherwise stated. While reactive simulations of longer or dynamic\\nlengths are generally desirable, e.g. to evaluate long-term decisions, enabling this requires dedicated\\nsolutions to long-horizon simulation that are not currently available in nuPlan [13]. Therefore, we\\ndefault to a fixed closed-loop simulation duration of d = 15s, and a planning frequency of f = 10Hz,\\nwhich are the standard closed-loop simulation settings in nuPlan [26].\\nMotion Planners. Open-loop metrics favor learned planners while rule-based approaches perform\\nwell in closed-loop evaluation in nuPlan [16]. We use a combination of both planner types in this\\nexperiment to cover different performance levels. In total, we include 37 rule-based planners with 2\\nconstant velocity and 8 constant acceleration models, 15 IDM planners [48], and 12 PDM-Closed\\nvariants [16] which differ in hyperparameters for trajectory generation. For learned planning, we\\nevaluate Urban Driver models [42] of 2 model sizes and 2 training lengths, and PlanCNN [38] models\\nwith 15 input combinations of the BEV raster, ego status, centerline, and navigation goal. We train\\nall models on {25%, 50%, 100%} of navtrain and an equally sized uniformly sampled subset of\\nOpenScene, giving 114 learned planners. See the supplementary material for additional details.\\nResults. The alignment between metrics is presented in Fig. 3 (a-e). Compared to OLS, we\\nconsistently observe better closed-loop correlation for PDMS, in terms of Spearman\\u2019s (rank) and\\nPearson\\u2019s (linear) correlation coefficients.

Relying on the ego status is insufficient for competitive results. While\\nsensor agents improve, the gap to human performance highlights our benchmark\\u2019s challenges.\\nproperties of both learned and rule-based planners, whereas distance-based open-loop metrics show\\na clear misalignment. Decreasing the CLS duration in (b) from d = 15s to d = 4s further raises\\nthe correlation of PDMS and OLS, as the simulation horizon more closely matches the open-loop\\ncounterparts. Interestingly, we observe a higher correlation of open-loop metrics in (c) when reducing\\nthe planning frequency to 2Hz. We expect a lower planning frequency to mitigate cumulative errors\\nand enhance the controller\\u2019s stability in simulation, leading to more precise trajectory execution.\\nMoreover, we observe an increase in correlation for longer PDMS horizons in (d), ranging from\\nh = 2s to h = 8s. While predicting the future motion over 8s is challenging in uncertain scenarios,\\nour results indicate the value of long horizons when evaluating motion planners. Lastly, replacing the\\nnon-reactive background agents with reactive IDM vehicles during closed-loop simulation in (e) has\\nlittle effect on the correlation, possibly due to the similar difficulty of both tasks [16].\\nThe imbalanced distribution of different types of planners in our study may introduce biases into\\nthe overall correlations presented in Fig. 3. To address this, we visualize the individual correlations\\nof each planner type in Fig. 4. The correlation values vary depending on metric range and variance\\nof each planner type. Nevertheless, when examining each type individually, the PDMS is better\\ncorrelated to the CLS than the OLS, and is always positively correlated.\\n4.2\\nAnalysis of the State of the Art in End-to-End Autonomous Driving\\nIn this section, we benchmark a collection of end-to-end architectures, which previously achieved\\nstate-of-the-art performance on existing open- or closed-loop benchmarks.\\nMethods.

We show our results on navtest in Table 1. The Constant Velocity model is a lower\\nbound, as the agent is used to identify trivial driving scenes excluded from the benchmark. The Ego\\nStatus MLP achieves a PDMS of 65.6, showing the value of the acceleration and navigation goal for\\navoiding collisions and driving off-road. However, we observe a clear gap between agents relying\\nsolely on the ego status and those considering sensor data, in contrast to results on nuScenes [32]. All\\nsensor agents achieve a PDMS of over 83, where TransFuser and PARA-Drive marginally perform\\nbest, with a PDMS of 84.0. Surprisingly, the camera-only LTF achieves similar results (83.8). UniAD\\nreaches a PDMS of 83.4, which, together with PARA-Drive, do not surpass the performance of\\nTransFuser and LTF, despite the need for more demanding training, e.g., 80 GPUs for 3 days to train\\nPARA-Drive versus 1 GPU for 1 day for TransFuser on the navtrain split. Due to the definition\\nof at-fault collisions, which discard certain rear-collisions into the ego vehicle, we suspect that\\nsurround-view cameras used by UniAD and PARA-Drive, and LiDAR input of TransFuser, are less\\nimportant than the wide-angle front camera which is the only input of LTF. The 10 PDMS discrepancy\\nto the human operator demonstrates that navtest poses challenges even to well-studied end-to-end\\narchitectures. Specifically, the drivable area compliance (DAC) and ego progress (EP) subscores\\nremain the most challenging. Notably, EP cannot be solved purely by human imitation, given that the\\nmaximum progress estimate used for normalization is based on a privileged rule-based motion planner.\\nInterestingly, all agents achieve near-perfect comfort scores, indicating that smooth acceleration and\\njerk profiles are learned naturally from human imitation.\\nAnalyzing TransFuser. In Table 2, we compare several training settings for TransFuser. For\\nthe three training seeds in configs A1-A3, we observe a standard deviation of \\u00b1 0.56 in PDMS,\\nwhich is relatively small compared to variance among training seeds for closed-loop simulations in\\nCARLA [17]. Further, unlike CARLA, NAVSIM is deterministic, and we obtain identical scores\\nwhen repeating evaluations of a deterministic driving agent.

(a) For each planner, we show open-loop metrics (OLS, PDMS)\\ntogether with the corresponding closed-loop score (CLS). The trendlines depicting correlations are fit\\nlinearly to all (learned and rule-based) planners. Moreover, we analyze different (b) CLS durations d,\\n(c) planning frequencies f, (d) PDMS horizons h, and (e) closed-loop background agent behaviors.\\n4.1\\nAlignment Between Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Evaluation\\nOpen-loop metrics should ideally be aligned with closed-loop metrics in their evaluation of different\\ndriving algorithms. In this section, we benchmark a large set of planners to analyze the alignment of\\nclosed-loop metrics with traditional distance-based open-loop metrics and the proposed PDMS.\\nBenchmark. Studying the relation of closed-loop and open-loop metrics necessitates access to a\\nfully reactive simulator. To stay compatible with the dataset, we use the nuPlan simulator [26], which\\nenables simulation for privileged planners with access to ground-truth perception and HD map inputs.\\nSimilar to PDMS, nuPlan combines weighted averages and multiplied penalties in two official scores:\\nthe open-loop score (OLS) aggregates displacement and heading errors with a multiplied miss-rate,\\nand the closed-loop score (CLS) implements similar metrics from Section 3. Including PDMS, all\\nmetrics are in [0, 1] with higher scores indicating better performance.\\nDue to the heavy computational requirements of closed-loop simulation, we evaluate on the navmini\\nsplit. This is a new split we create for rapid testing, with 396 scenarios in total that are independent of\\nboth navtrain and navtest but filtered using the same strategy (Section 3.1) and hence similarly\\ndistributed. We note that nuPlan offers two kinds of background agents: reactive agents along lane\\ncenters based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [48], and non-reactive agents replayed from the\\ndataset, which we employ unless otherwise stated. While reactive simulations of longer or dynamic\\nlengths are generally desirable, e.g. to evaluate long-term decisions, enabling this requires dedicated\\nsolutions to long-horizon simulation that are not currently available in nuPlan [13]. Therefore, we\\ndefault to a fixed closed-loop simulation duration of d = 15s, and a planning frequency of f = 10Hz,\\nwhich are the standard closed-loop simulation settings in nuPlan [26].\\nMotion Planners. Open-loop metrics favor learned planners while rule-based approaches perform\\nwell in closed-loop evaluation in nuPlan [16]. We use a combination of both planner types in this\\nexperiment to cover different performance levels. In total, we include 37 rule-based planners with 2\\nconstant velocity and 8 constant acceleration models, 15 IDM planners [48], and 12 PDM-Closed\\nvariants [16] which differ in hyperparameters for trajectory generation. For learned planning, we\\nevaluate Urban Driver models [42] of 2 model sizes and 2 training lengths, and PlanCNN [38] models\\nwith 15 input combinations of the BEV raster, ego status, centerline, and navigation goal. We train\\nall models on {25%, 50%, 100%} of navtrain and an equally sized uniformly sampled subset of\\nOpenScene, giving 114 learned planners. See the supplementary material for additional details.\\nResults. The alignment between metrics is presented in Fig. 3 (a-e).

While\\nsensor agents improve, the gap to human performance highlights our benchmark\\u2019s challenges.\\nproperties of both learned and rule-based planners, whereas distance-based open-loop metrics show\\na clear misalignment. Decreasing the CLS duration in (b) from d = 15s to d = 4s further raises\\nthe correlation of PDMS and OLS, as the simulation horizon more closely matches the open-loop\\ncounterparts. Interestingly, we observe a higher correlation of open-loop metrics in (c) when reducing\\nthe planning frequency to 2Hz. We expect a lower planning frequency to mitigate cumulative errors\\nand enhance the controller\\u2019s stability in simulation, leading to more precise trajectory execution.\\nMoreover, we observe an increase in correlation for longer PDMS horizons in (d), ranging from\\nh = 2s to h = 8s. While predicting the future motion over 8s is challenging in uncertain scenarios,\\nour results indicate the value of long horizons when evaluating motion planners. Lastly, replacing the\\nnon-reactive background agents with reactive IDM vehicles during closed-loop simulation in (e) has\\nlittle effect on the correlation, possibly due to the similar difficulty of both tasks [16].\\nThe imbalanced distribution of different types of planners in our study may introduce biases into\\nthe overall correlations presented in Fig. 3. To address this, we visualize the individual correlations\\nof each planner type in Fig. 4. The correlation values vary depending on metric range and variance\\nof each planner type. Nevertheless, when examining each type individually, the PDMS is better\\ncorrelated to the CLS than the OLS, and is always positively correlated.\\n4.2\\nAnalysis of the State of the Art in End-to-End Autonomous Driving\\nIn this section, we benchmark a collection of end-to-end architectures, which previously achieved\\nstate-of-the-art performance on existing open- or closed-loop benchmarks.\\nMethods.

While the idea of sampling and scoring\\ntrajectories is well-known [46, 51, 55, 6, 16], it has recently been overlooked in favor of approaches\\nwhich predict a single trajectory. This result prompts a reassessment of such methods. The team that\\nplaced second employed a vision language model (VLM) for driving, which is rapidly emerging as\\na sub-field in the AV literature [45, 33, 53, 58]. Several submissions attempted to reimplement or\\nextend prior work on nuScenes such as UniAD [21] and VAD [25], but were unable to outperform the\\nTransFuser baseline by the challenge submission deadline, given the significant engineering challenge\\nand compute requirements. The diversity of the solutions on the leaderboard shows the potential\\nof NAVSIM as a framework for pushing the frontiers of autonomous driving research. We aim to\\nhold future competitions with more challenging data and metrics.
