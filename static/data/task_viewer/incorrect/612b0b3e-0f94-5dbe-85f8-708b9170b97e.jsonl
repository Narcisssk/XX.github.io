{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Patents, as legal documents that secure intellectual property rights, play a critical role in technological innovation. The growing complexity of patent documents and the surge in patent applications have created a need for automated solutions in patent analysis. In this work, we present\\nPatExpert, an autonomous multi-agent conversational framework designed to streamline and optimize patent-related tasks. The framework consists of a meta-agent that coordinates task-specific expert agents for various patent-related tasks and a critique agent for error handling and feedback provision. The meta-agent orchestrates specialized expert agents, each fine-tuned for specific tasks such as\\npatent classification, acceptance, claim generation, abstractive summarization, multi-patent analysis, and scientific hypothesis generation. For multi-patent analysis, the framework incorporates advanced methods like Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) to enhance response accuracy and relevance by combining semantic similarity with knowledge graphs. Error handling is managed by critique agents (Gold-LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge), which evaluate output responses for accuracy and provide iterative feedback. The framework also prioritizes explainability, ensuring transparent justifications for decisions made during patent analysis. Its comprehensive capabilities make it a valuable tool for automating complex patent workflows, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and compliance in patent-related tasks. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in patent processing tasks, concluding that the framework offers a robust solution for automating and optimizing patent analysis.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Justice or Prejudice?

While many of the existing work on agents has focused on improving the performance of a specific family of objective and challenging tasks, in this work, we take a different perspective by thinking about full delegation: agents take over humans\\u2019 routine decision-making processes and are trusted by humans to find solutions that fit people\\u2019s personalized needs and are adaptive to ever-changing context. In order to achieve such a goal, the behavior of the agents, i.e., agentic behaviors, should be evaluated not only on their achievements (i.e., outcome evaluation), but also how they achieved that (i.e., procedure evaluation). For this, we propose APEC Agent Constitution, a list of criteria that an agent should follow for good agentic behaviors, including Accuracy, Proactivity, Efficiency and Credibility. To verify whether APEC aligns with human preferences, we develop APEC-Travel, a travel planning agent that proactively extracts hidden personalized needs via multi-round dialog with travelers. APEC-Travel is constructed purely from synthetic data generated by Llama3.1-405B-Instruct with a diverse set of travelers\\u2019 persona to simulate rich distribution of dialogs. Iteratively fine-tuned to follow APEC Agent Constitution, APEC-Travel surpasses baselines by 20.7% on rule based metrics and 9.1% on LLM-as-a-Judge scores across the constitution axes.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Cream: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models\",\"abstract\":\"Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee on the accurate of the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning frame work for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the rewarding consistency across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Generative Verifiers: Reward Modeling as Next-Token Prediction\",\"abstract\":\"Verifiers or reward models are often used to enhance the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). A common approach is the Best-of-N method, where N candidate solutions generated by the LLM are ranked by a verifier, and the best one is selected. While LLM-based verifiers are typically trained as discriminative classifiers to score solutions, they do not utilize the text generation capabilities of pretrained LLMs. To overcome this limitation, we instead propose training verifiers using the ubiquitous next-token prediction objective, jointly on verification and solution generation. Compared to standard verifiers, such generative verifiers (GenRM) can benefit from several advantages of LLMs: they integrate seamlessly with instruction tuning, enable chain-of-thought reasoning, and can utilize additional test-time compute via majority voting for better verification. We demonstrate that GenRM outperforms discriminative, DPO verifiers, and LLM-as-a-Judge, resulting in a 16-40% improvement in the number of problems solved with Best-of-N on algorithmic and math reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we find that training GenRM with synthetic verification rationales is sufficient to pick out subtle errors on math problems. Finally, we demonstrate that generative verifiers scale favorably with model size and inference-time compute.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Concept Unlearning for Large Language Models\",\"abstract\":\"Existing studies have reported that corpora on the Web for training large language models (LLMs) may contain undesirable information such as Personally Identifiable Information, leading to privacy violations when operating LLMs. \\nTo deal with this problem, Machine Unlearning (MU) has attracted attention, aiming to forget arbitrary information from AI models.  \\nHowever, the existing MU responds to a deletion request for specific data points in the AI model, and it is difficult to respond to a deletion request for a specific concept in the LLM (e.g., a person's name).\\nThis paper proposes a new MU requirement called Concept Unlearning (CU) to make LLMs forget arbitrary concepts from the perspective of a knowledge graph. \\nThis will allow us to define forgetting in terms of \\\"knowledge\\\", which is more intuitive to humans, and allow us to design effective methods for LLM forgetting. \\nWe also propose a method to realize CU by generating appropriate token sequences using LLMs and applying gradient ascent on the generated token sequences.\\nThe effectiveness of our method is confirmed by the dataset created from Wikipedia and LLM-as-a-Judge.\"}\n\nIn total, 6 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
