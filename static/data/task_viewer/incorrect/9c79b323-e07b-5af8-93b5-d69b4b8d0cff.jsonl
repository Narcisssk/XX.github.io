{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Claims\\nQuestion: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the\\npaper\\u2019s contributions and scope?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We claim that C-LAP is competitive to state-of-the-art methods and especially\\noutperforming on datasets with visual observations. These claims are based on evaluations\\non the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmark and the comparison to other relevant methods. We\\nclaim that we aim to solve value overestimation with our approach, which we empirically\\nshow on the walker2d datasets.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims\\nmade in the paper.\\n\\u2022 The abstract and\\/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the\\ncontributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or\\nNA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.\\n\\u2022 The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how\\nmuch the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.\\n\\u2022 It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals\\nare not attained by the paper.\\n2. Limitations\\nQuestion: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We include the limitations in a separate paragraph in the conclusion.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that\\nthe paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.\\n\\u2022 The authors are encouraged to create a separate \\\"Limitations\\\" section in their paper.\\n\\u2022 The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to\\nviolations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,\\nmodel well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors\\nshould reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the\\nimplications would be.\\n\\u2022 The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was\\nonly tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often\\ndepend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.\\n\\u2022 The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.\\nFor example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution\\nis low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be\\nused reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle\\ntechnical jargon.\\n\\u2022 The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms\\nand how they scale with dataset size.\\n\\u2022 If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to\\naddress problems of privacy and fairness.\\n\\u2022 While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by\\nreviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover\\nlimitations that aren\\u2019t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best\\njudgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-\\ntant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers\\nwill be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.\\n3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs\\n19\\nQuestion: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and\\na complete (and correct) proof?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We outline the derivation of the ELBO in the main section (Sec. 3) and provide\\na detailed derivation in the appendix A. We explain the derivation of the constrained latent\\naction policy step-by-step in the main section (Sec. 3).\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.\\n\\u2022 All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-\\nreferenced.\\n\\u2022 All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.\\n\\u2022 The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if\\nthey appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short\\nproof sketch to provide intuition.\\n\\u2022 Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented\\nby formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.\\n\\u2022 Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.\\n4. Experimental Result Reproducibility\\nQuestion: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-\\nperimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and\\/or conclusions\\nof the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We include the explanations of your approach in the main section (Sec. 3). We\\nreport the used hyper-parameters and an outline of the algorithm in the appendix (Appendix\\nB, D). We provide the code. We use publicly available benchmarks.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\\n\\u2022 If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived\\nwell by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of\\nwhether the code and data are provided or not.\\n\\u2022 If the contribution is a dataset and\\/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken\\nto make their results reproducible or verifiable.\\n\\u2022 Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.\\nFor example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully\\nmight suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may\\nbe necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same\\ndataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often\\none good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed\\ninstructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case\\nof a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are\\nappropriate to the research performed.\\n\\u2022 While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-\\nsions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the\\nnature of the contribution. For example\\n(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how\\nto reproduce that algorithm.\\n(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe\\nthe architecture clearly and fully.\\n(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should\\neither be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce\\nthe model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct\\nthe dataset).\\n20\\n(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case\\nauthors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.\\nIn the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in\\nsome way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers\\nto have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.\\n5. Open access to data and code\\nQuestion: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-\\ntions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental\\nmaterial?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We provide the code and include configuration files to reproduce our results.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.\\n\\u2022 Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:\\/\\/nips.cc\\/\\npublic\\/guides\\/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.\\n\\u2022 While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be\\npossible, so \\u201cNo\\u201d is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not\\nincluding code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source\\nbenchmark).\\n\\u2022 The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to\\nreproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:\\n\\/\\/nips.cc\\/public\\/guides\\/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.\\n\\u2022 The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how\\nto access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.\\n\\u2022 The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new\\nproposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they\\nshould state which ones are omitted from the script and why.\\n\\u2022 At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized\\nversions (if applicable).\\n\\u2022 Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the\\npaper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.\\n6. Experimental Setting\\/Details\\nQuestion: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-\\nparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the\\nresults?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: Yes, we shortly explain the experimental setting in the experiments section\\n(Sec. 4). We provide a general algorithm, a section on implementation details and the\\nhyper-parameters in the appendix (Appendix A, B, D). Furthermore, we share the code.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\\n\\u2022 The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail\\nthat is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.\\n\\u2022 The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental\\nmaterial.\\n7. Experiment Statistical Significance\\nQuestion: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate\\ninformation about the statistical significance of the experiments?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We provide the number of used seeds and report mean and standard deviation\\nin our evaluations in the experiments section (Sec. 4).\\nGuidelines:\\n21\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\\n\\u2022 The authors should answer \\\"Yes\\\" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-\\ndence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support\\nthe main claims of the paper.\\n\\u2022 The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for\\nexample, train\\/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall\\nrun with given experimental conditions).\\n\\u2022 The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,\\ncall to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)\\n\\u2022 The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).\\n\\u2022 It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error\\nof the mean.\\n\\u2022 It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should\\npreferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis\\nof Normality of errors is not verified.\\n\\u2022 For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or\\nfigures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative\\nerror rates).\\n\\u2022 If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how\\nthey were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.\\n8. Experiments Compute Resources\\nQuestion: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-\\nputer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce\\nthe experiments?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We explain the required computational resources appendix C.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.\\n\\u2022 The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,\\nor cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.\\n\\u2022 The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual\\nexperimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.\\n\\u2022 The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute\\nthan the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that\\ndidn\\u2019t make it into the paper).\\n9. Code Of Ethics\\nQuestion: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the\\nNeurIPS Code of Ethics https:\\/\\/neurips.cc\\/public\\/EthicsGuidelines?\\nAnswer: [Yes]\\nJustification: We give access to the complete method details and thoroughly share details of\\nthe experiments.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.\\n\\u2022 If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a\\ndeviation from the Code of Ethics.\\n\\u2022 The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-\\neration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).\\n10. Broader Impacts\\nQuestion: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative\\nsocietal impacts of the work performed?\\nAnswer: [NA]\\n22\\nJustification: We proposed method falls in the category of foundational research in the field\\nof offline reinforcement learning and the method is not tied to an application. Of course,\\napplications exist where reinforcement learning might have a negative societal impact, but\\nour method only has a limited influence on that.\\nGuidelines:\\n\\u2022 The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.\\n\\u2022 If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal\\nimpact or why the paper does not address societal impact.\\n\\u2022 Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses\\n(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations\\n(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific\\ngroups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.\\n\\u2022 The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied\\nto particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to\\nany negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate\\nto point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to\\ngenerate deepfakes for disinformation.

It is divided into three parts: first,\\nwe assess the performance using standard benchmarks; then, we study how different design choices\\naffect value overestimation; lastly, we analyze the influence of the support constraint parameter. We\\nadditionally provide the final performances in two tables in Appendix E.\\nWe limit our benchmark evaluation to the most relevant state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning\\nmethods to answer the following questions: 1) How do latent action state-space models compare to\\nstate-space models? 2) How comparable are model-free methods focusing on latent action spaces to\\nlatent action state-space models? 3) Does C-LAP suffer from value overestimation? 4) How does\\nthe support constraint affect the performance? 5) How does the performance differ between visual\\nobservations and observations with low-dimensional features? To focus on the latter, we separately\\nevaluate the performance on low-dimensional feature observations using the D4RL benchmark [26],\\nand on image observations using the V-D4RL benchmark [20].\\n4.1\\nBenchmark results\\nD4RL\\nSince most offline model-based reinforcement learning methods are designed for obser-\\nvations with low-dimensional feature observations, there exist many options for comparison. We\\nmake a selection to include the most relevant methods focusing on latent actions and auto-regressive\\nmodel-based reinforcement learning. Therefore, we include the following methods: PLAS, which\\nis a model-free method using a latent action space [10]. MOPO, a probabilistic ensemble-based\\noffline model-based reinforcement learning method using a modification to the Bellman update to\\npenalize high variance in next state predictions [16]. And MOBILE, which is similar to MOPO,\\nbut penalizes high variance in value estimates instead [18]. We compare the algorithms on three\\ndifferent locomotion environments, namely halfcheetah, walker2d and hopper, with four datasets\\n(medium-replay, medium, medium-expert, expert) each and the antmaze navigation environment\\nwith four datasets (umaze, umaze-diverse, medium-play, medium-diverse). The results, shown in\\nFigure 4, display the mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over four seeds during the\\nphase of policy training, with steps denoting gradient steps. The dashed lines indicate the asymptotic\\nperformance for MOPO and MOBILE. A detailed summary of all implementation details is provided\\nin the Appendix D.\\nWhen comparing C-LAP to PLAS, we find that learning a joint generative model of actions and\\nobservations outperforms a generative model of only actions when used with actor-critic reinforcement\\nlearning. Both methods can use the generative nature of the model to speed up policy learning,\\nwhich becomes especially clear in the results on all locomotion expert and medium-expert datasets.\\nCompared to MOPO and MOBILE, C-LAP shows a superior or comparable performance on all\\ndatasets except halfcheetah-medium-replay-v2, halfcheetah-medium-v2 and hopper-medium-v2.\\nEspecially outperforming on the antmaze environment, where MOPO and MOBILE fail to solve the\\ntask for any of the considered datasets. The asymptotic performance of MOBILE on locomotion\\nenvironments sometimes exceeds the results of C-LAP, but needs three times as many gradient steps.\\nOverall the results indicate that latent action state-space models with constrained latent action polices\\nnot only match the state-of-the-art on observations with low-dimensional features as observations, but\\nalso jump-start policy learning by using the action decoder to sample actions that lead to high rewards\\nalready after the first gradient steps: If the dataset is narrow, generated actions when sampling from\\nthe latent action prior will fall into the same narrow distribution. For instance, in an expert dataset,\\n6\\nFigure 4: Evaluation on low-dimensional feature observations using D4RL benchmark datasets. We\\nplot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\nsampled actions will also be expert-level actions. During policy training, instead of sampling from\\nthis prior, we restrict the support of the policy dependent on the latent action prior. Thus, sampled\\nlatent actions from the policy will always be decoded to fall into the dataset\\u2019s action distribution. So\\neven a randomly initialized policy in the beginning of the training can generate a high reward by\\nusing the latent action decoder. This effect is especially prominent in narrow datasets such as expert\\ndatasets.\\nV-D4RL\\nThere are currently few auto-regressive model-based reinforcement learning methods that\\nspecifically target visual observations, with none emphasizing latent actions. In our evaluation, we\\ninclude LOMPO [21] and Offline DV2 [20]. Both methods use a latent state space model and an\\nuncertainty penalized reward. However the specifics of the penalty calculations are different: while\\nLOMPO uses standard deviation of log probabilities as penalty, Offline DV2 uses mean disagreement.\\nAdditionaly, LOMPO trains an agent on a mix of real and imagined trajectories with an off-policy\\nactor-critic approach, whereas Offline DV2 exclusively trains on imagined trajectories and back-\\npropagates gradients through the dynamics model. Further implementation details are included in\\nAppendix D.\\nC-LAP demonstrates superior performance across all datasets, especially significant on cheetah-\\nrun-medium_expert, walker-walk-medium_expert and walker-walk_expert. Datasets with a large\\ndiversity of actions, such as medium-replay datasets, exhibit a weaker inductive bias for a generative\\naction model. Hence, they require more additional policy steps, as can be seen for both the D4RL\\nand V-D4RL benchmarks.\\n7\\nFigure 5: Evaluation on visual observations using V-D4RL benchmark datasets. We plot mean and\\nstandard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\n4.2\\nValue overestimation\\nLimiting value overestimation plays a central role in offline reinforcement learning. To evaluate\\nthe effectiveness of C-LAP, we report value estimates alongside normalized returns on all walker2d\\ndatasets in Figure 6. A similar analysis for all considered baselines is provided in Appendix G.\\nTo further analyze the influence of different action space design choices, we include the following\\nablations: a variant no constraint, which does not formulate policy optimization as constrained\\nobjective, but uses a Gaussian policy distribution to potentially cover the whole Gaussian latent action\\nspace; and a variant no latent action, which does not emphasize latent actions, but uses a regular\\nstate-space model as in Dreamer [29]. Besides that, we added dashed lines to indicate the dataset\\u2019s\\naverage return and average maximum value estimate. The no latent action variant fails to learn\\nFigure 6: Ablation study, comparing C-LAP to the following variants: no constraint, C-LAP without\\nenforcing the policy constraint dependent on the action prior; no latent action, C-LAP without a latent\\naction space similar to Dreamer [29]. We plot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns and\\nvalue estimates over 3 seeds. Moreover we add the dataset\\u2019s average return and average maximum\\nvalue estimate indicated by dashed lines.\\nan effective policy: normalized returns are almost zero and the dataset\\u2019s reference returns remain\\nunattained; value estimates are significantly exceeding the dataset\\u2019s reference values, indicating value\\noverestimation. The no constraint variant can use the generative action decoder to limit generated\\nactions to the dataset\\u2019s action distribution, but the Gaussian policy is free to move to regions which\\n8\\nare unlikely under the action prior. Thus, nullifying the implicit constraint imposed by the action\\ndecoder, resulting in collapsing returns and value overestimation. Only C-LAP achieves a high return\\nand generates value estimates which are close to the dataset\\u2019s reference. The value estimates on\\nwalker2d-medium-replay-v2 are higher than the dataset\\u2019s reference, as the agent\\u2019s performance is\\nalso exceeding the reference performance. The results confirm the importance of limiting value\\noverestimation in offline reinforcement learning, and demonstrate that constraining latent action\\npolicies can be an effective measure for achieving this.\\n4.3\\nSupport constraint parameter\\nTo evaluate the influence of the support constraint parameter \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 on the performance of C-LAP, we\\nperform a sensitivity analysis across all walker2d datasets (Figure 7). Except for the more diverse\\nmedium-replay-v2 dataset, adjusting \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 from 0.5 to 3.0 only has a minor impact on the achieved\\nreturn. However, when choosing an unreasonable large value such as \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 = 10.0 or removing the\\nconstraint altogether (Figure 6), we observe a collapse during training. This highlights a key insight:\\nconstraining the policy to the support of the latent action prior is essential. And in many cases, using\\na smaller support region closer to the mean (small \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5) proves sufficient.\\nFigure 7: Sensitivity analysis of the support constraint parameter \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 for the considered D4RL walker2d\\ndatasets. We plot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\n5\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nOffline reinforcement learning methods fall into two groups: model-free and model-based. Both\\ntypes aim to tackle problems like distribution shift and value overestimation. This happens because\\nthe methods use a fixed dataset rather than learning by interacting with the environment.\\nModel-free\\nCurrent model-free methods typically work by limiting the learned policy or by\\nregularizing value estimates. TD3+BC [11] adds a behavior cloning regularization term to the\\npolicy update objective to enforce actions generated by the policy to be close to the dataset\\u2019s action\\ndistribution. Similarly, SPOT [9] includes a regularization term in the policy update, derived from a\\nsupport constraint perspective. It also uses a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to estimate\\nthe behavior distribution. Following a comparable intention, BEAR [8] constraints the policy to\\nthe support of the behavior policy via maximum mean discrepancy. BCQ [7] and PLAS [10] use a\\nCVAE similarly but don\\u2019t use a regularization term. Instead, they constrain the policy implicitly by\\nmaking the generative model part of the policy. Beside these methods, many other approaches exist,\\nwith CQL [12] and IQL [14] being some of the most well-known. CQL uses a conservative policy\\nupdate by setting a lower bound on value estimates to prevent overestimation, while IQL avoids\\nout-of-distribution values by using a modified SARSA-like objective in combination with expectile\\nregression to only use state-action tuples contained in the dataset.\\nModel-based\\nModel-based offline reinforcement learning methods learn a dynamics model to\\ngenerate samples for policy training. This basically converts offline learning to an online learning\\nproblem. Model-based methods mainly address model errors and value overestimation by using\\na probabilistic ensemble and adding an uncertainty penalty in the Bellman update. MOPO [16]\\nuses a probabilistic ensemble as in [32] and adds the maximum standard deviation of all ensemble\\npredictions as uncertainty penalty. Similar to that, MOReL [17] adheres to the same methodology,\\nbut uses pairwise maximum difference of the ensemble predictions as penalty instead. Analogously,\\n9\\nMOBILE [18] estimates the values for all by the ensemble predicted states and uses the standard\\ndeviation of value estimates as penalty. Edge of reach [19] comes to the conclusion that value\\nestimation on edge of reach states are the overarching issue compared to model errors. In the end,\\nthey come up with a comparable solution to MOBILE, but use an ensemble of value networks\\nalongside the ensemble of dynamic models. COMBO [28] pursues a different approach, as they\\nintegrate the conservatism of CQL into value function updates, removing the need for uncertainty\\npenalties. Besides that, some methods use a different class of models: instead of learning a predictive\\nmodel in observation space, they use latent state-space models to make predictions on latent states.\\nAmong these methods is LOMPO [21], which builds up on Dreamer [29], but integrates an ensemble\\nto predict stochastic states and use the standard deviation of the log probability of the ensemble\\npredictions as an uncertainty penalty similar to previous methods. The policy is trained on a mix of\\nimagined and real world samples, hence they use an off-policy actor-critic style approach for policy\\nlearning. Offline DV2 [20] uses a similar model, but is based on a different penalty. Namely, they use\\nthe difference between the individual ensemble mean predictions and mean over all ensembles as\\nuncertainty penalty. Furthermore, the policy is trained only on imagined trajectories with gradients\\ncalculated by back-propagating through the dynamics model. Overall, Offline DV2 is the method\\nmost comparable to our approach, but still different in many ways as we propose a latent action\\nstate-space model compared to a usual state-space model, and frame policy learning as constrained\\noptimization. So far all discussed models operate in an auto-regressive fashion, but another class\\nof methods exists, which casts offline model-based reinforcement learning as trajectory modeling.\\nInstead of learning a policy, these kind of approaches integrate decision making and modeling of\\nthe underlying dynamics into a single objective and use the model for planning. Among them are\\nDiffuser [24], which employs guided diffusion for planning; TT [22], which builds on advances in\\ntransformers; and TAP [23], which uses a VQ-VAE with a transformer-based architecture to create a\\ndiscrete latent action space for planning.\\n6\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"Conclusion\\nWe present C-LAP, a model-based offline reinforcement learning method.

It is divided into three parts: first,\\nwe assess the performance using standard benchmarks; then, we study how different design choices\\naffect value overestimation; lastly, we analyze the influence of the support constraint parameter. We\\nadditionally provide the final performances in two tables in Appendix E.\\nWe limit our benchmark evaluation to the most relevant state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning\\nmethods to answer the following questions: 1) How do latent action state-space models compare to\\nstate-space models? 2) How comparable are model-free methods focusing on latent action spaces to\\nlatent action state-space models? 3) Does C-LAP suffer from value overestimation? 4) How does\\nthe support constraint affect the performance? 5) How does the performance differ between visual\\nobservations and observations with low-dimensional features? To focus on the latter, we separately\\nevaluate the performance on low-dimensional feature observations using the D4RL benchmark [26],\\nand on image observations using the V-D4RL benchmark [20].\\n4.1\\nBenchmark results\\nD4RL\\nSince most offline model-based reinforcement learning methods are designed for obser-\\nvations with low-dimensional feature observations, there exist many options for comparison. We\\nmake a selection to include the most relevant methods focusing on latent actions and auto-regressive\\nmodel-based reinforcement learning. Therefore, we include the following methods: PLAS, which\\nis a model-free method using a latent action space [10]. MOPO, a probabilistic ensemble-based\\noffline model-based reinforcement learning method using a modification to the Bellman update to\\npenalize high variance in next state predictions [16]. And MOBILE, which is similar to MOPO,\\nbut penalizes high variance in value estimates instead [18]. We compare the algorithms on three\\ndifferent locomotion environments, namely halfcheetah, walker2d and hopper, with four datasets\\n(medium-replay, medium, medium-expert, expert) each and the antmaze navigation environment\\nwith four datasets (umaze, umaze-diverse, medium-play, medium-diverse). The results, shown in\\nFigure 4, display the mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over four seeds during the\\nphase of policy training, with steps denoting gradient steps. The dashed lines indicate the asymptotic\\nperformance for MOPO and MOBILE. A detailed summary of all implementation details is provided\\nin the Appendix D.\\nWhen comparing C-LAP to PLAS, we find that learning a joint generative model of actions and\\nobservations outperforms a generative model of only actions when used with actor-critic reinforcement\\nlearning. Both methods can use the generative nature of the model to speed up policy learning,\\nwhich becomes especially clear in the results on all locomotion expert and medium-expert datasets.\\nCompared to MOPO and MOBILE, C-LAP shows a superior or comparable performance on all\\ndatasets except halfcheetah-medium-replay-v2, halfcheetah-medium-v2 and hopper-medium-v2.\\nEspecially outperforming on the antmaze environment, where MOPO and MOBILE fail to solve the\\ntask for any of the considered datasets. The asymptotic performance of MOBILE on locomotion\\nenvironments sometimes exceeds the results of C-LAP, but needs three times as many gradient steps.\\nOverall the results indicate that latent action state-space models with constrained latent action polices\\nnot only match the state-of-the-art on observations with low-dimensional features as observations, but\\nalso jump-start policy learning by using the action decoder to sample actions that lead to high rewards\\nalready after the first gradient steps: If the dataset is narrow, generated actions when sampling from\\nthe latent action prior will fall into the same narrow distribution. For instance, in an expert dataset,\\n6\\nFigure 4: Evaluation on low-dimensional feature observations using D4RL benchmark datasets. We\\nplot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\nsampled actions will also be expert-level actions. During policy training, instead of sampling from\\nthis prior, we restrict the support of the policy dependent on the latent action prior. Thus, sampled\\nlatent actions from the policy will always be decoded to fall into the dataset\\u2019s action distribution. So\\neven a randomly initialized policy in the beginning of the training can generate a high reward by\\nusing the latent action decoder. This effect is especially prominent in narrow datasets such as expert\\ndatasets.\\nV-D4RL\\nThere are currently few auto-regressive model-based reinforcement learning methods that\\nspecifically target visual observations, with none emphasizing latent actions. In our evaluation, we\\ninclude LOMPO [21] and Offline DV2 [20]. Both methods use a latent state space model and an\\nuncertainty penalized reward. However the specifics of the penalty calculations are different: while\\nLOMPO uses standard deviation of log probabilities as penalty, Offline DV2 uses mean disagreement.\\nAdditionaly, LOMPO trains an agent on a mix of real and imagined trajectories with an off-policy\\nactor-critic approach, whereas Offline DV2 exclusively trains on imagined trajectories and back-\\npropagates gradients through the dynamics model. Further implementation details are included in\\nAppendix D.\\nC-LAP demonstrates superior performance across all datasets, especially significant on cheetah-\\nrun-medium_expert, walker-walk-medium_expert and walker-walk_expert. Datasets with a large\\ndiversity of actions, such as medium-replay datasets, exhibit a weaker inductive bias for a generative\\naction model. Hence, they require more additional policy steps, as can be seen for both the D4RL\\nand V-D4RL benchmarks.\\n7\\nFigure 5: Evaluation on visual observations using V-D4RL benchmark datasets. We plot mean and\\nstandard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\n4.2\\nValue overestimation\\nLimiting value overestimation plays a central role in offline reinforcement learning. To evaluate\\nthe effectiveness of C-LAP, we report value estimates alongside normalized returns on all walker2d\\ndatasets in Figure 6. A similar analysis for all considered baselines is provided in Appendix G.\\nTo further analyze the influence of different action space design choices, we include the following\\nablations: a variant no constraint, which does not formulate policy optimization as constrained\\nobjective, but uses a Gaussian policy distribution to potentially cover the whole Gaussian latent action\\nspace; and a variant no latent action, which does not emphasize latent actions, but uses a regular\\nstate-space model as in Dreamer [29]. Besides that, we added dashed lines to indicate the dataset\\u2019s\\naverage return and average maximum value estimate. The no latent action variant fails to learn\\nFigure 6: Ablation study, comparing C-LAP to the following variants: no constraint, C-LAP without\\nenforcing the policy constraint dependent on the action prior; no latent action, C-LAP without a latent\\naction space similar to Dreamer [29]. We plot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns and\\nvalue estimates over 3 seeds. Moreover we add the dataset\\u2019s average return and average maximum\\nvalue estimate indicated by dashed lines.\\nan effective policy: normalized returns are almost zero and the dataset\\u2019s reference returns remain\\nunattained; value estimates are significantly exceeding the dataset\\u2019s reference values, indicating value\\noverestimation. The no constraint variant can use the generative action decoder to limit generated\\nactions to the dataset\\u2019s action distribution, but the Gaussian policy is free to move to regions which\\n8\\nare unlikely under the action prior. Thus, nullifying the implicit constraint imposed by the action\\ndecoder, resulting in collapsing returns and value overestimation. Only C-LAP achieves a high return\\nand generates value estimates which are close to the dataset\\u2019s reference. The value estimates on\\nwalker2d-medium-replay-v2 are higher than the dataset\\u2019s reference, as the agent\\u2019s performance is\\nalso exceeding the reference performance. The results confirm the importance of limiting value\\noverestimation in offline reinforcement learning, and demonstrate that constraining latent action\\npolicies can be an effective measure for achieving this.\\n4.3\\nSupport constraint parameter\\nTo evaluate the influence of the support constraint parameter \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 on the performance of C-LAP, we\\nperform a sensitivity analysis across all walker2d datasets (Figure 7). Except for the more diverse\\nmedium-replay-v2 dataset, adjusting \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 from 0.5 to 3.0 only has a minor impact on the achieved\\nreturn. However, when choosing an unreasonable large value such as \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 = 10.0 or removing the\\nconstraint altogether (Figure 6), we observe a collapse during training. This highlights a key insight:\\nconstraining the policy to the support of the latent action prior is essential. And in many cases, using\\na smaller support region closer to the mean (small \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5) proves sufficient.\\nFigure 7: Sensitivity analysis of the support constraint parameter \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 for the considered D4RL walker2d\\ndatasets. We plot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\n5\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nOffline reinforcement learning methods fall into two groups: model-free and model-based. Both\\ntypes aim to tackle problems like distribution shift and value overestimation. This happens because\\nthe methods use a fixed dataset rather than learning by interacting with the environment.\\nModel-free\\nCurrent model-free methods typically work by limiting the learned policy or by\\nregularizing value estimates. TD3+BC [11] adds a behavior cloning regularization term to the\\npolicy update objective to enforce actions generated by the policy to be close to the dataset\\u2019s action\\ndistribution. Similarly, SPOT [9] includes a regularization term in the policy update, derived from a\\nsupport constraint perspective. It also uses a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to estimate\\nthe behavior distribution. Following a comparable intention, BEAR [8] constraints the policy to\\nthe support of the behavior policy via maximum mean discrepancy. BCQ [7] and PLAS [10] use a\\nCVAE similarly but don\\u2019t use a regularization term. Instead, they constrain the policy implicitly by\\nmaking the generative model part of the policy. Beside these methods, many other approaches exist,\\nwith CQL [12] and IQL [14] being some of the most well-known. CQL uses a conservative policy\\nupdate by setting a lower bound on value estimates to prevent overestimation, while IQL avoids\\nout-of-distribution values by using a modified SARSA-like objective in combination with expectile\\nregression to only use state-action tuples contained in the dataset.\\nModel-based\\nModel-based offline reinforcement learning methods learn a dynamics model to\\ngenerate samples for policy training. This basically converts offline learning to an online learning\\nproblem. Model-based methods mainly address model errors and value overestimation by using\\na probabilistic ensemble and adding an uncertainty penalty in the Bellman update. MOPO [16]\\nuses a probabilistic ensemble as in [32] and adds the maximum standard deviation of all ensemble\\npredictions as uncertainty penalty. Similar to that, MOReL [17] adheres to the same methodology,\\nbut uses pairwise maximum difference of the ensemble predictions as penalty instead. Analogously,\\n9\\nMOBILE [18] estimates the values for all by the ensemble predicted states and uses the standard\\ndeviation of value estimates as penalty. Edge of reach [19] comes to the conclusion that value\\nestimation on edge of reach states are the overarching issue compared to model errors. In the end,\\nthey come up with a comparable solution to MOBILE, but use an ensemble of value networks\\nalongside the ensemble of dynamic models. COMBO [28] pursues a different approach, as they\\nintegrate the conservatism of CQL into value function updates, removing the need for uncertainty\\npenalties. Besides that, some methods use a different class of models: instead of learning a predictive\\nmodel in observation space, they use latent state-space models to make predictions on latent states.\\nAmong these methods is LOMPO [21], which builds up on Dreamer [29], but integrates an ensemble\\nto predict stochastic states and use the standard deviation of the log probability of the ensemble\\npredictions as an uncertainty penalty similar to previous methods. The policy is trained on a mix of\\nimagined and real world samples, hence they use an off-policy actor-critic style approach for policy\\nlearning. Offline DV2 [20] uses a similar model, but is based on a different penalty. Namely, they use\\nthe difference between the individual ensemble mean predictions and mean over all ensembles as\\nuncertainty penalty. Furthermore, the policy is trained only on imagined trajectories with gradients\\ncalculated by back-propagating through the dynamics model. Overall, Offline DV2 is the method\\nmost comparable to our approach, but still different in many ways as we propose a latent action\\nstate-space model compared to a usual state-space model, and frame policy learning as constrained\\noptimization. So far all discussed models operate in an auto-regressive fashion, but another class\\nof methods exists, which casts offline model-based reinforcement learning as trajectory modeling.\\nInstead of learning a policy, these kind of approaches integrate decision making and modeling of\\nthe underlying dynamics into a single objective and use the model for planning. Among them are\\nDiffuser [24], which employs guided diffusion for planning; TT [22], which builds on advances in\\ntransformers; and TAP [23], which uses a VQ-VAE with a transformer-based architecture to create a\\ndiscrete latent action space for planning.\\n6\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"Conclusion\\nWe present C-LAP, a model-based offline reinforcement learning method.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Experiments\",\"section_content\":\"Experiments\\nIn the next section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. It is divided into three parts: first,\\nwe assess the performance using standard benchmarks; then, we study how different design choices\\naffect value overestimation; lastly, we analyze the influence of the support constraint parameter. We\\nadditionally provide the final performances in two tables in Appendix E.\\nWe limit our benchmark evaluation to the most relevant state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning\\nmethods to answer the following questions: 1) How do latent action state-space models compare to\\nstate-space models? 2) How comparable are model-free methods focusing on latent action spaces to\\nlatent action state-space models? 3) Does C-LAP suffer from value overestimation? 4) How does\\nthe support constraint affect the performance? 5) How does the performance differ between visual\\nobservations and observations with low-dimensional features? To focus on the latter, we separately\\nevaluate the performance on low-dimensional feature observations using the D4RL benchmark [26],\\nand on image observations using the V-D4RL benchmark [20].\\n4.1\\nBenchmark results\\nD4RL\\nSince most offline model-based reinforcement learning methods are designed for obser-\\nvations with low-dimensional feature observations, there exist many options for comparison. We\\nmake a selection to include the most relevant methods focusing on latent actions and auto-regressive\\nmodel-based reinforcement learning. Therefore, we include the following methods: PLAS, which\\nis a model-free method using a latent action space [10]. MOPO, a probabilistic ensemble-based\\noffline model-based reinforcement learning method using a modification to the Bellman update to\\npenalize high variance in next state predictions [16]. And MOBILE, which is similar to MOPO,\\nbut penalizes high variance in value estimates instead [18]. We compare the algorithms on three\\ndifferent locomotion environments, namely halfcheetah, walker2d and hopper, with four datasets\\n(medium-replay, medium, medium-expert, expert) each and the antmaze navigation environment\\nwith four datasets (umaze, umaze-diverse, medium-play, medium-diverse). The results, shown in\\nFigure 4, display the mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over four seeds during the\\nphase of policy training, with steps denoting gradient steps. The dashed lines indicate the asymptotic\\nperformance for MOPO and MOBILE. A detailed summary of all implementation details is provided\\nin the Appendix D.\\nWhen comparing C-LAP to PLAS, we find that learning a joint generative model of actions and\\nobservations outperforms a generative model of only actions when used with actor-critic reinforcement\\nlearning. Both methods can use the generative nature of the model to speed up policy learning,\\nwhich becomes especially clear in the results on all locomotion expert and medium-expert datasets.\\nCompared to MOPO and MOBILE, C-LAP shows a superior or comparable performance on all\\ndatasets except halfcheetah-medium-replay-v2, halfcheetah-medium-v2 and hopper-medium-v2.\\nEspecially outperforming on the antmaze environment, where MOPO and MOBILE fail to solve the\\ntask for any of the considered datasets. The asymptotic performance of MOBILE on locomotion\\nenvironments sometimes exceeds the results of C-LAP, but needs three times as many gradient steps.\\nOverall the results indicate that latent action state-space models with constrained latent action polices\\nnot only match the state-of-the-art on observations with low-dimensional features as observations, but\\nalso jump-start policy learning by using the action decoder to sample actions that lead to high rewards\\nalready after the first gradient steps: If the dataset is narrow, generated actions when sampling from\\nthe latent action prior will fall into the same narrow distribution. For instance, in an expert dataset,\\n6\\nFigure 4: Evaluation on low-dimensional feature observations using D4RL benchmark datasets. We\\nplot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\nsampled actions will also be expert-level actions. During policy training, instead of sampling from\\nthis prior, we restrict the support of the policy dependent on the latent action prior. Thus, sampled\\nlatent actions from the policy will always be decoded to fall into the dataset\\u2019s action distribution. So\\neven a randomly initialized policy in the beginning of the training can generate a high reward by\\nusing the latent action decoder. This effect is especially prominent in narrow datasets such as expert\\ndatasets.\\nV-D4RL\\nThere are currently few auto-regressive model-based reinforcement learning methods that\\nspecifically target visual observations, with none emphasizing latent actions. In our evaluation, we\\ninclude LOMPO [21] and Offline DV2 [20]. Both methods use a latent state space model and an\\nuncertainty penalized reward. However the specifics of the penalty calculations are different: while\\nLOMPO uses standard deviation of log probabilities as penalty, Offline DV2 uses mean disagreement.\\nAdditionaly, LOMPO trains an agent on a mix of real and imagined trajectories with an off-policy\\nactor-critic approach, whereas Offline DV2 exclusively trains on imagined trajectories and back-\\npropagates gradients through the dynamics model. Further implementation details are included in\\nAppendix D.\\nC-LAP demonstrates superior performance across all datasets, especially significant on cheetah-\\nrun-medium_expert, walker-walk-medium_expert and walker-walk_expert. Datasets with a large\\ndiversity of actions, such as medium-replay datasets, exhibit a weaker inductive bias for a generative\\naction model. Hence, they require more additional policy steps, as can be seen for both the D4RL\\nand V-D4RL benchmarks.\\n7\\nFigure 5: Evaluation on visual observations using V-D4RL benchmark datasets. We plot mean and\\nstandard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\n4.2\\nValue overestimation\\nLimiting value overestimation plays a central role in offline reinforcement learning. To evaluate\\nthe effectiveness of C-LAP, we report value estimates alongside normalized returns on all walker2d\\ndatasets in Figure 6. A similar analysis for all considered baselines is provided in Appendix G.\\nTo further analyze the influence of different action space design choices, we include the following\\nablations: a variant no constraint, which does not formulate policy optimization as constrained\\nobjective, but uses a Gaussian policy distribution to potentially cover the whole Gaussian latent action\\nspace; and a variant no latent action, which does not emphasize latent actions, but uses a regular\\nstate-space model as in Dreamer [29]. Besides that, we added dashed lines to indicate the dataset\\u2019s\\naverage return and average maximum value estimate. The no latent action variant fails to learn\\nFigure 6: Ablation study, comparing C-LAP to the following variants: no constraint, C-LAP without\\nenforcing the policy constraint dependent on the action prior; no latent action, C-LAP without a latent\\naction space similar to Dreamer [29]. We plot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns and\\nvalue estimates over 3 seeds. Moreover we add the dataset\\u2019s average return and average maximum\\nvalue estimate indicated by dashed lines.\\nan effective policy: normalized returns are almost zero and the dataset\\u2019s reference returns remain\\nunattained; value estimates are significantly exceeding the dataset\\u2019s reference values, indicating value\\noverestimation. The no constraint variant can use the generative action decoder to limit generated\\nactions to the dataset\\u2019s action distribution, but the Gaussian policy is free to move to regions which\\n8\\nare unlikely under the action prior. Thus, nullifying the implicit constraint imposed by the action\\ndecoder, resulting in collapsing returns and value overestimation. Only C-LAP achieves a high return\\nand generates value estimates which are close to the dataset\\u2019s reference. The value estimates on\\nwalker2d-medium-replay-v2 are higher than the dataset\\u2019s reference, as the agent\\u2019s performance is\\nalso exceeding the reference performance. The results confirm the importance of limiting value\\noverestimation in offline reinforcement learning, and demonstrate that constraining latent action\\npolicies can be an effective measure for achieving this.\\n4.3\\nSupport constraint parameter\\nTo evaluate the influence of the support constraint parameter \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 on the performance of C-LAP, we\\nperform a sensitivity analysis across all walker2d datasets (Figure 7). Except for the more diverse\\nmedium-replay-v2 dataset, adjusting \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 from 0.5 to 3.0 only has a minor impact on the achieved\\nreturn. However, when choosing an unreasonable large value such as \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 = 10.0 or removing the\\nconstraint altogether (Figure 6), we observe a collapse during training. This highlights a key insight:\\nconstraining the policy to the support of the latent action prior is essential. And in many cases, using\\na smaller support region closer to the mean (small \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5) proves sufficient.\\nFigure 7: Sensitivity analysis of the support constraint parameter \\u02dc\\n\\u03f5 for the considered D4RL walker2d\\ndatasets. We plot mean and standard deviation of normalized returns over 4 seeds.\\n5\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"Conclusion\\nWe present C-LAP, a model-based offline reinforcement learning method. To tackle the issue of\\nvalue overestimation, we first propose an auto-regressive latent-action state space model to learn a\\ngenerative model of the joint distribution of observations and actions. Second, we propose a method\\nfor policy training to stay within the dataset\\u2019s action distribution. We explicitly parameterize the\\npolicy depending on the latent action prior and formulate policy learning as constrained objective\\nsimilar to a support constraint. We find that C-LAP significantly speeds-up policy learning, is\\ncompetitive on the D4RL benchmark and especially outperforms on the V-D4RL benchmark, raising\\nthe best average score across all dataset\\u2019s from previously 31.5 to 58.8.\\nLimitations\\nDepending on the dataset and environment the effectiveness of C-LAP differs: Datasets\\nwhich only contain random actions are challenging for learning a generative action model, thus we do\\nnot include them in our evaluation. The effect of jump-starting policy learning with the latent action\\ndecoder to already achieve high rewards in the beginning of policy training is prominent in narrow\\ndatasets, but less effective for diverse datasets. While training the model of C-LAP does not require\\nadditional gradient steps, it still takes more time compared to LOMPO [21] and Offline DV2 [20] as\\nthe latent action state-space model is more complex than a usual latent state-space model.\\nReferences\\n[1] Gabriel Dulac-Arnold, Daniel J.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"Conclusion\\nWe present C-LAP, a model-based offline reinforcement learning method. To tackle the issue of\\nvalue overestimation, we first propose an auto-regressive latent-action state space model to learn a\\ngenerative model of the joint distribution of observations and actions. Second, we propose a method\\nfor policy training to stay within the dataset\\u2019s action distribution. We explicitly parameterize the\\npolicy depending on the latent action prior and formulate policy learning as constrained objective\\nsimilar to a support constraint. We find that C-LAP significantly speeds-up policy learning, is\\ncompetitive on the D4RL benchmark and especially outperforms on the V-D4RL benchmark, raising\\nthe best average score across all dataset\\u2019s from previously 31.5 to 58.8.\\nLimitations\\nDepending on the dataset and environment the effectiveness of C-LAP differs: Datasets\\nwhich only contain random actions are challenging for learning a generative action model, thus we do\\nnot include them in our evaluation. The effect of jump-starting policy learning with the latent action\\ndecoder to already achieve high rewards in the beginning of policy training is prominent in narrow\\ndatasets, but less effective for diverse datasets. While training the model of C-LAP does not require\\nadditional gradient steps, it still takes more time compared to LOMPO [21] and Offline DV2 [20] as\\nthe latent action state-space model is more complex than a usual latent state-space model.\\nReferences\\n[1] Gabriel Dulac-Arnold, Daniel J.
