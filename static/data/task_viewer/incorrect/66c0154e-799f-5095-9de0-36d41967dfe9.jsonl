{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"INTRODUCTION\\nReal-world sequential medical data in areas such as Human Activity Recognition (Chen et al.,\\n2021), suicide risk monitoring (Porras-Segovia et al., 2022), or activity detection in atrial fibrillation\\nelectrograms (R\\u00b4\\n\\u0131os-Mu\\u02dc\\nnoz et al., 2020) often are irregularly sampled, of variable length, and exhibit\\nlong-range dependencies. Furthermore, these data, which may be drawn from EEG readings (Vahid\\net al., 2020) or wearable devices (Moreno-Pino et al., 2022), are often sampled at high frequency\\nfor long periods of time, yielding long sequences of data. Hence, many popular machine learning\\nmodels struggle to model real-world medical sequential data, due to input dimension inflexibility,\\nmemory constraints, and computational bottlenecks. Rather than treating these data as discrete\\nsequences, effective theoretical models often assume data are generated from some underlying\\ncontinuous-time process (Morariu-Patrichi & Pakkanen, 2022; Ratcliff et al., 2016). Hence, there is\\nan increased interest in developing machine learning methods which analyze sequential medical data\\nusing continuous-time representations.\\nOne recent approach to modeling continuous-time data involves the development of continuous-\\ntime analogues of standard deep learning models, such as Neural ODEs (Chen et al., 2018) and\\nNeural CDEs (Kidger et al., 2020), which extend ResNets (He et al., 2016) and RNNs (Funahashi &\\nNakamura, 1993), respectively, to continuous-time settings.\\nInstead of processing discrete data directly, these models operate on a latent continuous-time rep-\\nresentation of input sequences. This approach is successful in continuous-time modeling tasks\\nwhere standard deep recurrent models fail. In particular, extensions of vanilla Neural ODEs to the\\ntime-series setting (Rubanova et al., 2019; Kidger et al., 2020) succeed in various domains such as\\n\\u2217Equal contribution.\\n\\u2020Corresponding author. Email: fernando.moreno-pino@eng.ox.ac.uk.\\n1\\nAccepted at the ICLR 2024 Workshop on Learning from Time Series for Health\\nadaptive uncertainty quantification (Norcliffe et al., 2021), counterfactual inference (Seedat et al.,\\n2022), or generative modeling (Calvo-Ordonez et al., 2023).\\nIn many practical medical settings, such as human behaviour changes detection (Berrouiguet et al.,\\n2018), sleep activity recognition (Mart\\u00b4\\n\\u0131nez-Garc\\u00b4\\n\\u0131a et al., 2023), or heart rate fluctuations (Hausdorff\\n& Peng, 1996), continuous-time data also exhibit long-range dependencies. That is, data from the\\ndistant past may impact the system\\u2019s current behavior. Deep recurrent models struggle in this setting\\ndue to vanishing gradients. Several recent works (Melnychuk et al., 2022; Nguyen & Grover, 2022;\\nMoreno-Pino et al., 2023) successfully extract long-range dependencies from sequential data with\\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), which learn temporal dependencies of a tokenized representation\\nof input sequences. As the attention mechanism is permutation invariant, extracting such temporal\\ndependencies requires a positional embedding of input data which projects data into some latent space.\\nThe parallelizable nature of the Transformer allows for rapid training and evaluation on sequences\\nof moderate length and has contributed to its success in fields such as natural language processing\\n(NLP).\\nWhile the above approaches succeed in certain settings, several limitations hinder their wider applica-\\ntions. On the one hand, Neural ODEs and their analogues (Rubanova et al., 2019; Kidger et al., 2020)\\nbear substantial computational costs when modeling long sequences of high dimension (see Morrill\\net al., 2021). On the other hand, Transformers operate on discrete-time representations of input\\nsequences, whose relative ordering is represented by the positional embedding. This representation\\nmay inhibit their expressivity in continuous-time data modeling tasks (Zeng et al., 2023). Moreover,\\nTransformer-based models suffer from a number of difficulties, including (i) input sequences must\\nbe sampled at the same times, (ii) the sequence length must be fixed, and (iii) the computational\\ncost scales quadratically in the length of the input sequence. These difficulties severely limit the\\napplication of Transformers to continuous-time data modeling.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"CONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we introduced the Rough Transformer, a variant of the original Transformer that allows\\nthe processing of discrete-time series as continuous-time signals through the use of multi-view\\nsignature attention. Empirical comparisons showed that Rough Transformers outperform vanilla\\nTransformers and continuous-time models on a variety of time-series tasks and are robust to the sam-\\npling rate of the signal. Finally, we show that RFormer provides significant speedups in training time\\ncompared to regular attention and ODE-based methods, without the need for major architectural mod-\\nifications or sparsity constraints. In future work, it would be interesting to see if Rough Transformers\\nalso provide good performance in other application domains such as finance (Scalzo et al., 2021;\\nMoreno-Pino & Zohren, 2022; Arroyo et al., 2022; 2024) or weather forecasting (Nguyen et al., 2023).\\nREFERENCES\\nImanol Perez Arribas.

Furthermore, these data, which may be drawn from EEG readings (Vahid\\net al., 2020) or wearable devices (Moreno-Pino et al., 2022), are often sampled at high frequency\\nfor long periods of time, yielding long sequences of data. Hence, many popular machine learning\\nmodels struggle to model real-world medical sequential data, due to input dimension inflexibility,\\nmemory constraints, and computational bottlenecks. Rather than treating these data as discrete\\nsequences, effective theoretical models often assume data are generated from some underlying\\ncontinuous-time process (Morariu-Patrichi & Pakkanen, 2022; Ratcliff et al., 2016). Hence, there is\\nan increased interest in developing machine learning methods which analyze sequential medical data\\nusing continuous-time representations.\\nOne recent approach to modeling continuous-time data involves the development of continuous-\\ntime analogues of standard deep learning models, such as Neural ODEs (Chen et al., 2018) and\\nNeural CDEs (Kidger et al., 2020), which extend ResNets (He et al., 2016) and RNNs (Funahashi &\\nNakamura, 1993), respectively, to continuous-time settings.\\nInstead of processing discrete data directly, these models operate on a latent continuous-time rep-\\nresentation of input sequences. This approach is successful in continuous-time modeling tasks\\nwhere standard deep recurrent models fail. In particular, extensions of vanilla Neural ODEs to the\\ntime-series setting (Rubanova et al., 2019; Kidger et al., 2020) succeed in various domains such as\\n\\u2217Equal contribution.\\n\\u2020Corresponding author.

That is, data from the\\ndistant past may impact the system\\u2019s current behavior. Deep recurrent models struggle in this setting\\ndue to vanishing gradients. Several recent works (Melnychuk et al., 2022; Nguyen & Grover, 2022;\\nMoreno-Pino et al., 2023) successfully extract long-range dependencies from sequential data with\\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), which learn temporal dependencies of a tokenized representation\\nof input sequences. As the attention mechanism is permutation invariant, extracting such temporal\\ndependencies requires a positional embedding of input data which projects data into some latent space.\\nThe parallelizable nature of the Transformer allows for rapid training and evaluation on sequences\\nof moderate length and has contributed to its success in fields such as natural language processing\\n(NLP).\\nWhile the above approaches succeed in certain settings, several limitations hinder their wider applica-\\ntions. On the one hand, Neural ODEs and their analogues (Rubanova et al., 2019; Kidger et al., 2020)\\nbear substantial computational costs when modeling long sequences of high dimension (see Morrill\\net al., 2021). On the other hand, Transformers operate on discrete-time representations of input\\nsequences, whose relative ordering is represented by the positional embedding. This representation\\nmay inhibit their expressivity in continuous-time data modeling tasks (Zeng et al., 2023). Moreover,\\nTransformer-based models suffer from a number of difficulties, including (i) input sequences must\\nbe sampled at the same times, (ii) the sequence length must be fixed, and (iii) the computational\\ncost scales quadratically in the length of the input sequence. These difficulties severely limit the\\napplication of Transformers to continuous-time data modeling.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"CONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we introduced the Rough Transformer, a variant of the original Transformer that allows\\nthe processing of discrete-time series as continuous-time signals through the use of multi-view\\nsignature attention. Empirical comparisons showed that Rough Transformers outperform vanilla\\nTransformers and continuous-time models on a variety of time-series tasks and are robust to the sam-\\npling rate of the signal. Finally, we show that RFormer provides significant speedups in training time\\ncompared to regular attention and ODE-based methods, without the need for major architectural mod-\\nifications or sparsity constraints. In future work, it would be interesting to see if Rough Transformers\\nalso provide good performance in other application domains such as finance (Scalzo et al., 2021;\\nMoreno-Pino & Zohren, 2022; Arroyo et al., 2022; 2024) or weather forecasting (Nguyen et al., 2023).\\nREFERENCES\\nImanol Perez Arribas.

This is in sharp contrast with the original SSL methods. In fact, current\\nSSL lacks of theoretical guarantees as all existing studies have derived optimality conditions at the\\nprojector\\u2019s output [21, 36, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99] which is not the output of interest since the projector\\nis thrown away after SSL training and the DNN\\u2019s output and the projector\\u2019s output greatly differ\\n[1, 16, 17, 100]. As a further demonstration of DIET\\u2019s theory-friendliness, we propose in Appendix E\\na theoretical study of DIET with a linear model f\\u03b8, in which case we are able to prove that DIET\\nperforms a low-rank decomposition of the input data matrix and provably recovers the data\\u2019s principal\\ncomponents. Again, that last result highlights how Eq. (1) greatly reduces the barrier to derive novel\\ntheoretical resutls and guarantee for SSL.\\nBenefits for practical development and deployment Second, the amount of code refactoring\\nis minimal: there is no change required for the data loading pipelines as opposed to SSL which\\nrequires positive pairs, no need to specify teacher-student architectures, and no need to design a\\nprojector\\/predictor DNN. Second, DIET\\u2019s implementation is not architecture specific as we validate\\non Resne(x)ts, ConvNe(x)ts, Vision Transformers and their variants. Furthermore, DIET does\\nnot introduce any additional hyper-parameters in addition to the ones already present in supervised\\nlearning\\u2013and because DIET\\u2019s training loss is informative of test classification performances (Fig. 3)\\u2013it\\nopens the door to truely label-free SSL.\\nC\\nRelation Between DIET and Existing SSL\\nDespite DIET\\u2019s simplicity, we could not find an existing method that considered it perhaps due to the\\ncommon belief that dealing with hundreds of thousands of classes (N in Fig. 1, the training set size)\\nwould not produce successful training. As such, the closest method to ours is Exemplar CNN [24]\\nwhich extracts a few patches from a given image dataset, and treats each of them as their own class;\\nthis way the number of classes is the number of extracted patches, which is made independent from\\nN. A more recent method, Instance Discrimination [25] extends this by introducing inter-sample\\ndiscrimination. However, they do so using a non-parametric softmax, i.e., by defining a learnable bank\\nof centroids to cluster training samples; for successful training those centroids must be regularized\\nto prevent representation collapse. As we will compare in Table 1, DIET outperforms Instance\\nDiscrimination and Exemplar CNN while being simpler. Lastly, methods such as Noise as Targets\\n[26] and DeepCluster [42] are quite far from DIET as (i) they perform clustering and use the datum\\u2019s\\ncluster as its class, i.e., greatly reducing the dependency on N; and (ii) they perform clustering in the\\noutput space of the model f\\u03b8 being learned which brings multiple collapsed solutions that force those\\n12\\nargument is simple, suppose one aims to minimize a reconstruction metric R for some input x\\nR(d\\u03b3(e\\u03b7(x)), x),\\n(2)\\nwhere e\\u03b7 and d\\u03b3 are parametrized learnable encoder and decoder networks respectively; e\\u03b7(x) is the\\nrepresentation of interest to be used after training. In practice, as soon as some noise \\u03f5 is present\\nin the data, i.e. we observe x + \\u03f5 and not x, that noise \\u03f5 must be encoded by e\\u03b7 to minimize the\\nloss from Eq. (2) unless one carefully designs R so that R(x + \\u03f5, x) = 0. However, designing such\\na noise invariant R has been attempted for decades [8, 85, 86, 87, 88] and remains a challenging\\nopen problem. Hence, many solutions rely on learning R, e.g., in VAE-GANs [9] bringing even\\nfurther instabilities and training challenges. Other alternatives carefully tweak R per dataset and\\narchitectures, e.g., to only compute the reconstruction loss on parts of the data as with BERT [89] or\\nMAEs [90]. Lastly, the quality of the encoder representation depends on its architecture but also on\\nthe decoder [91, 92] making cross-validation more costly and unstable [93].\\nSSL is the family of method that have produced the most significant state-of-the-art solutions in\\nrecent years. Hence, it is the solution of choice that any practitioner hopes to deploy. As such, we\\npropose to take a step towards understanding and alleviating the many practical challenges that would\\nbe up against through DIET\\u2013a stripped down SSL pipeline.\\nB\\nBenefits for Practical Deployment and Theoretical Research\\nThere are many direct benefit of the DIET\\u2019s objective emerging from its simplicity.

In fact, current\\nSSL lacks of theoretical guarantees as all existing studies have derived optimality conditions at the\\nprojector\\u2019s output [21, 36, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99] which is not the output of interest since the projector\\nis thrown away after SSL training and the DNN\\u2019s output and the projector\\u2019s output greatly differ\\n[1, 16, 17, 100]. As a further demonstration of DIET\\u2019s theory-friendliness, we propose in Appendix E\\na theoretical study of DIET with a linear model f\\u03b8, in which case we are able to prove that DIET\\nperforms a low-rank decomposition of the input data matrix and provably recovers the data\\u2019s principal\\ncomponents. Again, that last result highlights how Eq. (1) greatly reduces the barrier to derive novel\\ntheoretical resutls and guarantee for SSL.\\nBenefits for practical development and deployment Second, the amount of code refactoring\\nis minimal: there is no change required for the data loading pipelines as opposed to SSL which\\nrequires positive pairs, no need to specify teacher-student architectures, and no need to design a\\nprojector\\/predictor DNN. Second, DIET\\u2019s implementation is not architecture specific as we validate\\non Resne(x)ts, ConvNe(x)ts, Vision Transformers and their variants. Furthermore, DIET does\\nnot introduce any additional hyper-parameters in addition to the ones already present in supervised\\nlearning\\u2013and because DIET\\u2019s training loss is informative of test classification performances (Fig. 3)\\u2013it\\nopens the door to truely label-free SSL.\\nC\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Concentration Benefits Generalization\",\"section_content\":\"Concentration Benefits Generalization\\nIn this section, we present pilot experiments to analyze the correlation between domain generalizability\\nand attention concentration of prompts using RoBERTa-Large Liu et al.

From the effect of\\nprompts in forward propagation, we analyze (i) how much each prompt is concentrated by the LM,\\nand (ii) how stable the concentration is to formulate the correspondence.\\nBackground. Attention mechanisms are widely studied for PLM interpretability Wang et al. [2022],\\nClark et al. [2019], Lin et al. [2019], Htut et al. [2019]. As for prompt optimization, Wang et al.\\n[2023] provide insights that label words in in-context learning aggregate most of the attention weights\\nin deep layers of PLM, which majorly determine the final prediction. Inspired by this, we further\\nexplore the attention weight on the whole prompt sequence and its impact on prompt generalizability\\nfrom a global perspective.\\nDefinition 3.1.

Right: boxplots of the concentration strength in the last layer. Overall, prompts that exhibit good\\ndomain generalization gain higher concentration strength and lower concentration fluctuation. The\\nconcentration strength of each layer is shown in Appendix C.2.\\nOur pilot experiment unveils following insights: (i) Prompts with larger Concentration Strength\\nachieve better performance in domain generalization. For instance, Figure 3(left) shows that tokens\\nof ICL\\u2020, the best-performed method, gain more than 0.8 of Concentration Strength at the 21st layer\\nand over 0.7 at the 23rd layer. (ii) Prompts with lower Concentration Fluctuation tend to generalize to\\ntarget domain better. As shown in Figure 3(right), Soft\\u2020 and ICL\\u2217are concentrated at a similar level,\\nbut ICL\\u2217generalizes better while its stability is better. (iii) High Concentration Strength and low\\nConcentration Fluctuation together contribute most to prompt generalizability. The best-performed\\nICL\\u2020 has most Concentration Strength and lowest Concentration Fluctuation across all comparison\\nprompts. These discoveries inspire us to adjust the objective for soft prompt\\u00a74.1 and hard prompt\\u00a74.2\\noptimization towards increasing Concentration Strength while decreasing Concentration Fluctuation.\\n4\\n4\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Benefits of In-context Examples\",\"section_content\":\"Benefits of In-context Examples\\nWe try to understand the benefit of leveraging in-context examples by decomposing the relative\\nMSE error into \\u201cscale\\u201d and \\u201cshape.\\u201d \\u201cScale\\u201d is the slope of a linear regression between targets\\nand predictions (closer to 1 the better), indicating the alignment of the range of model outputs with\\ntargets. \\u201cShape\\u201d is the normalized relative MSE (i.e., model outputs or targets are normalized by\\ntheir own largest magnitude before MSE), indicating the alignment of scale-invariant spatial\\/temporal\\nstructures.
