{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Recent work has demonstrated that in-context learning requires very little data and zero parameter updates, and even outperforms trained methods in the few-shot setting (Hu et al., 2022). We propose RefPyDST, which advances the state of the art with three advancements to in-context learning for DST. First, we formulate DST as a Python programming task, explicitly modeling language coreference as variable reference in Python. Second, since in-context learning depends highly on the context examples, we propose a method to retrieve a diverse set of relevant examples to improve performance. Finally, we introduce a novel re-weighting method during decoding that takes into account probabilities of competing surface forms, and produces a more accurate dialogue state prediction. We evaluate our approach using MultiWOZ and achieve state-of-the-art multi-domain joint-goal accuracy in zero and few-shot settings.1\"}\n{\"title\":\"Diverse Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning for Dialogue State Tracking\",\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Dialogue state tracking (DST) is an important language understanding task required for supporting task-oriented conversational agents. For each turn in a dialogue, the goal of DST is to extract the intentions and arguments a user communicates into a meaning representation aligned with the capabilities of the system. Often, this can be represented as a set of slot-value pairs, using slots defned in a system schema. For example, if a user asks a hotel booking agent for \\\"a four-star hotel with somewhere to park\\\", the agent could extract the state {(hotel-stars, 4), (hotel-parking, yes)}.\\nAnnotating these turn-level dialogue states is challenging and time-intensive (Budzianowski et al., 2018). Further, as system capabilities evolve\\nFigure 1: Our retrieval-augmented in-context learning approach to DST. We construct a prompt which re-frames DST as a Python programming task conditioned on a system defnition and set of retrieved examples $\\\\mathcal{E}_{k}$ (green). For each dialogue turn $t$ , the goal is to take the current state (state) and turn utterances $(\\\\mathtt{p r i n t}\\\\,(\\\\,\\\\ldots\\\\,)\\\\,)$ as \\u2018input\\u2019 and produce a program which updates the state with missing values, i.e. (restaurant-area, west). We represent linguistic coreference explicitly as variable reference (pink)\\nover time, the schema and DST requirements change. As such, fexible and data-effcient DST methods are highly valuable.\\nFor these reasons, recent work has explored zero and few-shot methods for DST. Few-shot methods often fne-tune a pre-trained language model (LM) on DST or a re-framing of the task (e.g. Su et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2021a). While these systems are often data effcient, they are infexible to changing system defnitions, requiring re-training as new services are added. To address this, zero-shot methods for domain transfer have been proposed (e.g. Wu et al., 2019; Hosseini-Asl et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2022), but their performance in new domains can signifcantly depend on conceptual overlap with training domains (Wu et al., 2019).\\n\\nThe in-context learning framework (ICL) (Brown et al., 2020) is particularly appealing in this setting given that it is highly data-effcient and fexible: instead of fne-tuning, ICL methods prompt a fxed LM with templated examples for a task. This approach requires no re-training when adapting to schema changes. In recent work, Hu et al. (2022) fnd that prompting a language model with examples for DST in a text-to-SQL format can outperform fne-tuned zero and few-shot methods.\\nIn this work, we propose RefPyDST, a retrievalaugmented in-context learning approach to DST for use with language models pre-trained on code, such as OpenAI Codex (Chen et al., 2021), by building on recent ICL methods for DST (Hu et al., 2022). Our approach advances the state of the art with three key contributions.\\nFirst, we develop a novel in-context prompt that re-frames DST as text-to-python, explicitly modeling slot value coreferents using variables. We provide an overview of this prompt and example of such coreference in Figure 1. We demonstrate that this approach signifcantly improves system performance in the zero and few-shot settings, and particularly improves accuracy on predictions requiring coreference resolution.\\nSecond, we introduce a novel method for diverse supervised example retrieval, which yields a set of in-context examples $\\\\mathcal{E}_{k}$ that are both individually relevant and collectively representative of the output space, inspired by maximum marginal relevance (MMR) (Goldstein and Carbonell, 1998). Our approach signifcantly improves performance in few-shot settings, overcoming a failure mode in supervised example retrieval in which examples are each similar to an input $x$ but redundant in the outputs they demonstrate.\\nThird, we propose a novel scoring method $P M I^{\\\\beta}$ which compensates for surface-form competition among sampled LM completions in constrained generation settings. Inspired by Holtzman et al. (2021), we re-weigh each completion $y$ by an estimate of its a priori likelihood in the task context. We fnd this improves system performance in both the zero and few-shot settings.\\nTogether, our contributions address key challenges in DST and in retrieval-augmented ICL generally. Our method produces state-of-the-art results on MultiWOZ 2.1 and 2.4 DST benchmarks across a variety of few-shot settings. Similarly, we obtain a new zero-shot state-of-the-art in the multi-domain setting.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Diverse Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning for Dialogue State Tracking\",\"section_title\":\"2 Task Defnition\",\"section_content\":\"A task-oriented dialogue consists of turns or paired utterances between a user and an agent which interfaces the user with a programmable system. At each turn $t$ , the purpose of a DST module is to use the dialogue history up to that turn to predict a dialogue state $y_{t}$ , which represents the user\\u2019s goal and progress in using the system. Let $A_{i}$ be an agent utterance, $U_{i}$ be a user utterance, and $C_{t}\\\\,=\\\\,[(A_{1},U_{1}),(A_{2},U_{2}),...(A_{t},U_{t})]^{2}$ be the dialogue history up to turn $t$ . The task is to map the history $C_{t}$ to a state representation $y_{t}$ . In this work, we predict dialogue states $y_{t}$ which can be represented as slot-value pairs:\\nwhere each slot $s_{i}$ and the types of values it permits are defned in a system schema. For example, an agent supporting hotel reservations might have a slot \\u2018hotel-parking\\u2019 taking boolean values for constraining search to hotels that include parking.\\nWe can equivalently defne this task as predicting state changes, as proposed in Hu et al. (2022). Let $x_{t}\\\\;=\\\\;[y_{t-1},(A_{t},U_{t})]$ be a dialogue context consisting of the previous dialogue state prediction and utterances for the current turn. Using this turn context $x_{t}$ , we predict a state change:\\nwhere $y_{t}$ is computed by applying the difference $\\\\Delta y_{t}$ to $y_{t-1}$ . This approach has two advantages for few-shot in-context learning. First, the turn context $x_{t}$ requires fewer tokens to represent than the complete history $C_{t}$ , permitting more in-context examples. Second, the number of distinct state changes $\\\\Delta y_{t}$ observed in practice is much smaller than the number of distinct states $y_{t}$ , simplifying the search for relevant examples and the generation problem.\\nFor these reasons, we formulate our DST problem as mapping from the turn context $x_{t}$ to a state change $\\\\Delta y_{t}$ . For readability, we often use \\u2018turn\\u2019 to refer to this turn context $x_{t}$ , distinguishing it from the history $C_{t}$ or turn number $t$ using notation.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Diverse Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning for Dialogue State Tracking\",\"section_title\":\"5 Results\",\"section_content\":\"Few-shot DST on MultiWOZ We present fewshot and full-shot dialogue state tracking results on MultiWOZ 2.1 & 2.4 in Table 1.

Regarding student essay detection, we found that the OpenAI LLMs were the most difficult\\nto distinguish from humans, except by classifiers trained on OpenAI texts. Further investigation\\ndemonstrated that OpenAI texts are similar to human texts based on entropy and OOV ratio.\\nThese results suggest that the quality of AIG texts varies between writing domains. Training a\\nclassifier with one LLM (or even one family) also leads to some generalizability in detecting texts\\nfrom out-of-distribution families. However, we limit our analysis to writing domains that typically\\ninvolve longer texts. For example, Amazon reviews and social media posts are often shorter. Future\\nwork might explore how LLM detection varies across these domains, which are highly susceptible to\\nLLM-generation abuse.\\nFuture AI-text detector developers should take care in curating a diverse corpus of texts spanning\\nseveral domains and LLMs and take note of which LLMs are better at mimicking human writing.\\n7\\nReferences\\n[1] AWS.
