{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Confict Event Data\",\"section_content\":\"This paper considers the publicly available Nonviolent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (NAVCO) data collection (Chenoweth et al., 2018), specifcally, the latest release NAVCO 3.0 from November 2019 which comprises $N\\\\,=\\\\,112{,}089$ events between December 1990 and December 2012. An exemplary event description is \\u201cOn 19 May 2012, soldiers injured two civilians in Afghanistan\\u201d. Each part of this description has been parsed by human coders into standardized, structural features. We color-code the features that correspond to the semantic roles subject, predicate, quantifer, object, which are the focus of our modeling approach. Each data point $n$ thus consists of a four-element tuple $\\\\{s_{n},p_{n},q_{n},o_{n}\\\\}$ . We note that events are further coded for their location (in this case, Afghanistan) and time (19 May 2012), among other bits of contextual information. Let us discuss each feature in more detail:\\nSubject $s_{n}$ . NAVCO contains columns termed \\u201cactor3\\u201d, \\u201cactor6\\u201d and \\u201cactor9\\u201d which code for the subject (or agent) of a given action. The actor types are defned by the CAMEO actor codebook. We frst merge the higher-level categories \\u201cactor3\\u201d and \\u201cactor6\\u201d, resulting in 33 different actor types, and then map all actor types into one of $S=4$ classes: $s_{n}~\\\\in$ {civilian, military, governmental, political}. We present our 4-class actor type mapping in Tab. 3 of the appendix.\\n\\nPredicate $p_{n}$ (Goldstein values). NAVCO codes1 each event description into one of the 20 CAMEO action categories in the column \\u201cverb $10^{\\\\circ}$ which is by extension associated with a Goldstein value $p_{n}$ . Throughout, we refer to the Goldstein value $p_{n}$ as an action\\u2019s \\u201cpredicate\\u201d, since there is a one-to-one mapping between action categories and Goldstein values. We scale Goldstein values $p_{n}$ to a $[0,1]$ range and invert them (i.e., $p_{n}\\\\gets1-p_{n})$ so that higher values close to 1 represent more confictual action categories.\\nQuantifer $q_{n}$ (casualty counts). Each event description is annotated with human-verifed fatality and wounded counts. We add the two and refer to the resulting value $q_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}_{0}^{+}$ as an event\\u2019s \\u201cquantifer\\u201d or its \\u201ccasualty count\\u201d. In Tab. 1, we give the average number of casualties associated with each action alongside its Goldstein value\\u2014as intuition might suggest, actions that Goldstein scores as more confictual (e.g., \\u201cfght\\u201d $(-10.0))$ coincide with more casualties on average.\\n\\nObject $o_{n}$ . Similar to its subject, NAVCO codes for the direct object or \\u201ctarget\\u201d of a confict action using the CAMEO coding scheme; these codes are found in the columns \\u201ctarget3\\u201d and \\u201ctarget6\\u201d. We map those into the $O\\\\,=\\\\,4$ classes so that $o_{n}~\\\\in$ {civilian, military, governmental, political $\\\\}$ .\\nContextual information: location and time. Finally, each event is further annotated with a timestamp and location, which we use to design extrinsic evaluation tasks in $\\\\S6$ .\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"ACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist\",\"section_content\":\"\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
