{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We validate that our proposed PromptAttack has significantly stronger attack power com-\\npared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ on GLUE dataset (Wang et al., 2018). Further, we provide\\nextensive empirical analyses of the properties of the adversarial samples generated by PromptAt-\\n6\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\ntack. Finally, we release the adversarial dataset named AdvGLUE-GPT1 to facilitate the robustness\\nevaluation of LLMs which is generated by PromptAttack-FS-EN against GPT-3.5.\\nGLUE dataset.\\nFollowing AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), we consider the following five chal-\\nlenging tasks in GLUE dataset (Wang et al., 2018): Sentiment Analysis (SST-2), Duplicate Question\\nDetection (QQP), and Natural Language Inference (MNLI, RTE, QNLI). We provide a detailed de-\\nscription of each task in Appendix B.1.\\nTask description.\\nFollowing PromptBench (Zhu et al., 2023), we used four types of task descrip-\\ntions, i.e., the zero-shot (ZS)\\/few-shot (FS) task-oriented (TO)\\/role-oriented (RO) task descriptions.\\nFor simplicity, we denote them as ZS-TO, ZS-RO, FS-TO, FS-RO task descriptions. We list the\\ntask descriptions used for each task in our Github and calculate the average results over all task\\ndescriptions to provide a reliable evaluation for each task. For example, we demonstrate the task\\ndescriptions for solving the SST-2 task in Table 23.\\nBaselines.\\nWe take the adversarial datasets AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) and Ad-\\nvGLUE++ (Wang et al., 2023a) as the baselines. We downloaded AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++\\nfrom the official GitHub of Wang et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2023a).\\nAttack success rate (ASR).\\nFollowing AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), we use the attack success\\nrate (ASR) on the adversarial samples filtered according to the fidelity scores as the measure of\\nattack power. The ASR is calculated as follows:\\nASR =\\nP\\n(x,y)\\u2208D 1[f(g(x, \\u02dc\\nx; \\u03c41, \\u03c42), TD) \\u0338= y] \\u00b7 1[f(x, TD) = y]\\nP\\n(x,y)\\u2208D 1[f(x, TD) = y]\\n,\\nwhere D is the original test dataset, f(x, TD) denotes the prediction result by a LLM f given a test\\nsample x and a task description TD, g(x, \\u02dc\\nx; \\u03c41, \\u03c42) outputs the adversarial sample post-processed\\nby the fidelity filter.\\nConfigurations for fidelity filter.\\nAs for AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), we do not apply the\\nfidelity filter to AdvGLUE (i.e., setting \\u03c41 = 1.0, \\u03c42 = 0.0) since the adversarial samples in Ad-\\nvGLUE have been carefully filtered to achieve high fidelity. As for AdvGLUE++ (Wang et al.,\\n2023a), we apply the fidelity filter with \\u03c41 = 15% and \\u03c42 = 0.0 following AdvGLUE since the\\nadversarial samples in AdvGLUE++ are generated by character-level and word-level perturbations\\nwithout any filtering. As for our proposed PromptAttack, we set \\u03c41 = 15% for the character-level\\nand word-level PromptAttack while keeping \\u03c41 = 1.0 for sentence-level PromptAttack. We take\\n\\u03c42 as the average BERTScore of the adversarial samples in AdvGLUE for each task to ensure high\\nfidelity of the sentence-level adversarial samples and report the threshold \\u03c42 in Appendix B.2. We\\nreport the ASR of AdvGLUE++ and PromptAttack without being filtered in Appendix B.3.\\nVictim LLMs\\nIn our experiments, we apply PromptAttack to attack two kinds of small-scale\\nLLMs (Touvron et al., 2023) (Llama2-7B and Llama2-13B) and a large-scale LLM (OpenAI, 2023)\\n(i.e., GPT-3.5). The Llama2 checkpoints are downloaded from the official Hugging Face reposi-\\ntory (Touvron et al., 2023). We used the OpenAI API to query GPT-3.5 by setting the version as\\n\\u201cgpt-3.5-turbo-0301\\u201d and setting other configurations as default.\\n4.1\\nROBUSTNESS EVALUATION ON GLUE DATASET\\nWe demonstrate the ASR evaluated on the GLUE dataset using various victim LLMs under Ad-\\nvGLUE, AdvGLUE++ as well as PromptAttack with only an ensemble strategy (PromptAttack-EN)\\nand PromptAttack with both few-shot and ensemble strategies (PromptAttack-FS-EN) in Table 3.\\nPromptAttack can effectively evaluate LLMs\\u2019 robustness.\\nThe ASR achieved by PromptAttack\\nsignificantly outperforms AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ over all the tasks in the GLUE dataset. No-\\ntably, PromptAttack-FS-EN increases the average ASR on GPT-3.5 over all tasks by 22.83% (from\\n25.51% to 48.34%). It validates that PromptAttack which is adaptive to the victim LLM can gener-\\nate a stronger adversarial sample of high fidelity. Therefore, our proposed PromptAttack can serve\\nas an effective tool to efficiently audit the LLM\\u2019s adversarial robustness.\\n1The AdvGLUE-GPT dataset is released at the GitHub.\\n7\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTable 3: We report the ASR (%) evaluated on each task of the GLUE dataset using various\\nvictim LLMs.\\nPromptAttack-EN incorporates PromprtAttack with the ensemble strategy while\\nPromptAttack-FS-EN uses both few-shot and few-shot strategies. \\u201cAvg\\u201d refers to the average ASR\\nover all the tasks.

(2023b). Besides, although Llama2-\\n13B has a larger number of parameters than Llama2-7B, our empirical results show that Llama2-13B\\nseems to be more adversarially vulnerable than Llama2-13B because Llama2-13B always obtains a\\nhigher ASR under our proposed PromptAttack.\\nThe ASR of PromptAttack-FS-EN is sensitive to the LLM\\u2019s comprehension ability.\\nWe ob-\\nserve that, compared to PromptAttack-EN, PromptAttack-FS-EN degrades ASR using Llama2 while\\nenhancing ASR using GPT-3.5. We conjecture that it is because Llama2 has a smaller number of\\nparameters than GPT-3.5, thus leading to a worse comprehension of the few-shot AG and degrad-\\ning the quality of the generated adversarial sample under PromptAttack-FS-EN. For example, the\\nadversarial sample generated by Llama2-7B under PromptAttack-FS-EN (shown in Table 22) is al-\\nways composed of two sentences connected by a meaningless arrow pattern (\\u201c->\\u201d), which exactly\\nfollows the format of extra examples in the few-shot AG shown in Section 3.3. These adversarial\\nsamples are of low quality and are easily filtered out by the fidelity filter, thus leading to a lower\\nASR achieved by PromptAttack-FS-EN against Llama2 compared to PromptAttack-EN.\\n4.2\\nEXTENSIVE EMPIRICAL RESULTS\\nComputational efficiency.\\nTables 4 shows the estimated computational consumption of Ad-\\nvGLUE, AdvGLUE++, and PromptAttack against GPT-3.5. Our proposed PromptAttack only re-\\nquire a few black-box queries to the victim LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) without loading the model\\nparameters and conducting complex optimization procedures (e.g., backpropagations) on the local\\nmachine, which makes it much more computationally efficient than AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++.\\nASR w.r.t.\\nBERTScore threshold \\u03c42.\\nFigure 3 demonstrates the ASR under the fidelity fil-\\nter with various BERTScore threshold \\u03c42 and \\u03c41 = 1.0. It validates that PromptAttack-EN and\\nPromptAttack-FS-EN can achieve a much higher ASR at a high BERTScore threshold \\u03c42 than Ad-\\nvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. For example, when \\u03c42 = 0.95 in the QNLI task, PromptAttack-FS-EN\\nalmost achieves 48% ASR while the ASR of AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ is lower than 10%. It\\njustifies that PromptAttack can generate adversarial samples of strong attack power and high fidelity.\\nASR w.r.t. the type of perturbation instruction.\\nTable 8 shows that the attack power of sentence-\\nlevel perturbation is stronger than character-level and word-level perturbations, which is in line with\\nthe conclusions of Wang et al. (2023a). Besides, Table 8 validates the effectiveness of the few-shot\\nstrategy in enhancing attack power since using the few-shot strategy can yield a higher ASR.\\n8\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n0.70\\n0.75\\n0.80\\n0.85\\n0.90\\n0.95\\n1.00\\nBERTScore threshold \\u03c42\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\nAttack Success Rate (%)\\nSST-2\\nAdvGLUE\\nAdvGLUE++\\nPromptAttack-EN\\nPromptAttack-FS-EN\\n0.70\\n0.75\\n0.80\\n0.85\\n0.90\\n0.95\\n1.00\\nBERTScore threshold \\u03c42\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\nAttack Success Rate (%)\\nQQP\\n0.70\\n0.75\\n0.80\\n0.85\\n0.90\\n0.95\\n1.00\\nBERTScore threshold \\u03c42\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nAttack Success Rate (%)\\nMNLI-m\\n0.70\\n0.75\\n0.80\\n0.85\\n0.90\\n0.95\\n1.00\\nBERTScore threshold \\n2\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nAttack Success Rate (\\\\%)\\nMNLI-mm\\n0.70\\n0.75\\n0.80\\n0.85\\n0.90\\n0.95\\n1.00\\nBERTScore threshold \\u03c42\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\nAttack Success Rate (%)\\nRTE\\n0.70\\n0.75\\n0.80\\n0.85\\n0.90\\n0.95\\n1.00\\nBERTScore threshold \\u03c42\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nAttack Success Rate (%)\\nQNLI\\nFigure 3: The ASR w.r.t. BERTScore threshold \\u03c42 evaluated on the GLUE dataset.\\nASR w.r.t. the type of task description.\\nTables 9-14 in Appendix B.5 validate that PromptAttack\\nconsistently yields a higher ASR via different types of task descriptions. The RO task descriptions\\nalways yield a lower ASR than TO task descriptions, which indicates that RO task descriptions could\\nbe a defensive strategy. Besides, it shows that FS task descriptions are more robust than ZO task\\ndescriptions for GPT-3.5, which is consistent with conclusions in Zhu et al. (2023); whereas, the\\nASR via FS task descriptions is much higher than that via ZO task descriptions for Llama2. We\\nprovide extensive discussions of this phenomenon in Appendix B.5.\\nASR w.r.t. various in-context learning methods.\\nTable 15 reports the performance of Promp-\\ntAttack under the superior in-context learning methods including few-shot in-context learning (Garg\\net al., 2022), chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), and automatic prompt engineering\\n(APE) (Zhou et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023). The performance is evaluated on the SST-2 dataset\\nusing GPT-3.5. Table 15 shows that PromptAttack consistently achieves a high ASR under various\\ndefensive methods, which validates that PromptAttack is a powerful adversarial attack.\\nASR under the perplexity (PPL) filter.\\nA baseline defense (Jain et al., 2023) for LLMs uses the\\nPPL filter to filter out low-quality prompts, thus defending against adversarial attacks. The PPL\\nfilter is applicable to defending against adversarial examples. Table 16 shows that the ASR under\\nthe PPL filter achieved by PromptAttack is still much higher than AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++,\\nwhich validates that AdvGLUE-GPT can provide a reliable robustness evaluation of the LLM.\\nAttack transferability.\\nTables 17 and 18 show the attack transferability of PromptAttack between\\nGPT-3.5 and Llama2. The result validates that our proposed PromptAttack can be transferred to\\nsuccessfully fool other victim LLMs. Besides, it further justifies that GPT-3.5 is more adversarially\\nrobust than Llama2 since Llama2 achieves a higher ASR under adversarial samples against GPT-3.5\\n(shown in Table 17) and GPT-3.5 achieves a lower ASR under adversarial samples against Llama2\\nin most tasks (shown in Table 18).
