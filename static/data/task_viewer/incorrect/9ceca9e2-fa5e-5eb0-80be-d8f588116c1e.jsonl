{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Tweets are more likely to be subjective and polarized (appendix A.1). On the other hand, tweets also contain unique lexical features like acronyms, emojis, user mentions, retweets, hashtags, as shown in Figure 1, and can be used as different parts of speech (Table 6, appendix A.2). In this paper, we focus on converting standard English sentences into tweets by making lexical transformations and injecting labels wherever required. Example transformations are shown in Figure 2.\\nLexcial transformations add target domainspecifc lexical features to the source domain dataset such that these properties are \\u2018distributionally\\u2019 conserved. For example, when our target domain is Twitter, we expect Tweets to contain emojis. We can measure the distributional presence of emojis in tweets, like the percentage of tweets that on average contain emojis or how they are distributed within the sentence, i.e. if they are more likely to occur in the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. In lexical transformations, we add\\nTable 1: Table showing the dataset statistics for GUM and Tweebank datasets (TBv2). In this paper, all models are tested on the test set of TBv2, which is our target domain set. For compelete statistics, refer to A.1.\\nthese distributional properties to the source domain sentences. Since we are adding these features to an annotated dataset, we also inject the label of the lexical feature wherever required. The process is discussed in detail in section 4. The resulting sentences are almost indistinguishable from Tweets, as can be seen in Figure 2. It is not trivial to inject these lexical features into the standard English sentences as the same feature can correspond to multiple parts of speech, as shown in Table 6.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"A.7 Combining All Lexical Data Transformations\",\"section_content\":\"When we combine all lexical data transformations, we achieve signifcant boost in performance on the Twitter dataset.

PageRank conducts\\nthis by analyzing large-scale hyperlinked graphs on the web using random walker simulations. Unlike\\ntraditional PageRank that assigns a universal score to each web page, PPR customizes these scores.\\nSpecifically, individual user preferences during searches are incorporated, so that PPR can focus on\\nweb pages particularly relevant to each user. Due to its flexibility and effectiveness, PPR has been\\nwidely applied in graph learning across various fields, such as social networks, recommendation\\nsystems, and biological data analysis.\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 4, this algorithm starts with a predefined preference node (or target node), which\\nis emphasized according to the user\\u2019s interests. Subsequently, a random walk is conducted on the\\ngraph to facilitate graph traversal. At each step of the walk, there is a fixed probability \\u03b1 that the\\nwalker will jump back to the target node from the current node instead of moving to an adjacent\\nnode chosen at random. This process of jumping, commonly referred to as \\\"teleportation\\\", biases the\\nwalk towards subgraphs that are of particular importance to the target node, thus personalizing the\\nresults according to user preferences.

These scores effectively evaluate each node\\u2019s structural similarities and rank them according\\nto their relevance and importance from a personalized perspective.\\nPPR transformation.\\nIn scCello, the PPR algorithm is applied to the cell ontology graph to\\nassess the structural similarities among cell types, or to measure their importance relative to a\\nspecified target cell type. We implemented PPR using the \\\"pagerank\\\" function in NetworkX [23]\\nwith \\\"personalization\\\" as arguments.\\nHowever, modification is needed to integrate PPR into TFM pre-training. The PPR scores are in\\nreal-number format and susceptible to numerical noise. Also, as shown in Fig. 5a, these scores\\ntypically exhibit a skewed distribution, concentrated around lower magnitudes. Consequently, setting\\nprecise thresholds to differentiate between node similarity and dissimilarity is challenging. Moreover,\\nthe vast amount small PPR values may be indistinguishable from noise.\\nTo mitigate the effects of numerical noise and skewed magnitudes for the PPR scores, we employ\\ntruncation, logarithmic scaling, and discretization as outlined in Eqn. 3. Note that Eqn. 3 defines a\\nmonotonic, non-decreasing function that preserves the relative order between nodes. Its minimum\\nvalue is set to 1 for the least similar cell types.\\nThis equation transforms the raw PPR score, PPR(\\u00b7), into the final structural similarity, sim(\\u00b7). This\\ntransformation ensures that sim(\\u00b7) accurately reflects pronounced similarities as defined by the cell\\nontology and avoids emphasizing minor dissimilarities that could mislead during TFM pre-training.\\nAnalyses.\\nIn Fig. 5, we present a comparison of the distributions for the PPR score, PPR(\\u00b7),\\nand the transformed structural similarity, sim(\\u00b7). After transformation, the distribution of sim(\\u00b7) is\\nless skewed and exhibits clear discretization. This facilitates the setting of definitive thresholds for\\ndistinguishing between similarity and dissimilarity among cell types, thereby enabling the effective\\nincorporation of the cell ontology graph in scCello\\u2019s pre-training.\\nIn addition, we provide detailed insights into the scale of structural similarity, the distribution of these\\nsimilarities for each cell type, and examples of cell types associated with various levels of structural\\nsimilarity:\\n(1) Fig. 6 illustrates the correspondence between the structural similarity after PPR transfor-\\nmation and the original PPR scores, showcasing a log-linear relationship as expected. This\\nhelps clarify the scaling of structural similarity, which is discretized into integer levels\\nranging from 1 to 11.\\n(2) Fig. 7 demonstrates how frequently each target cell type is associated with other cell types\\nat specific levels of structural similarity. Consequently, during scCello\\u2019s pre-training, a\\nsubstantial number of negative samples are expected to be utilized in the inter-cellular\\nrelational alignment objective, as outlined in Sec. 2.4.\\n17\\nTable 7: Examples of cell types associated with various levels of structural similarity, sim(\\u00b7), for\\nspecified target cell types.

Then, we\\nformulate FLAD as a multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem, shown in Figure 1. Next, we define\\nreward functions that are efficient to compute and appropriate for FLAD. Finally, we describe our\\nadaptations of two popular MAB algorithms: EXP3-FLAD and UCB1-FLAD.\\n3.1\\nSetup\\nFLAD problem setting.\\nFew-shot learning with auxiliary data (FLAD) fits into the following\\nsetting: assume access to a large set of auxiliary datasets DA where, for all a \\u2208A, Da is an individual\\nauxiliary dataset. Given a small quantity of data belonging to a target dataset DT , the goal of FLAD\\nis to find parameters \\u03b8 of a model f\\u03b8 that achieve high performance on the unknown distribution\\nunderlying DT while utilizing only the available data, DT \\u222aDA.\\nFormulating FLAD as MAB.\\nIn this work, we adopt the multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting\\nby formulating FLAD as a Markov decision process [33] and defining a learner and environment,\\nillustrated in Figure 1. The learner consists of a policy \\u03c0 defining a selection strategy over all\\nDa \\u2208DA. The environment consists of the target dataset DT , auxiliary datasets DA, and model\\nf\\u03b8. In this formulation the learner interacts with the environment over N rounds. At each round t\\nthe learner selects one of the environment\\u2019s |A| datasets Da \\u2208DA. Next, the environment samples\\na batch {x, y} \\u223cDa and calculates the gradient w.r.t. \\u03b8 using a task-appropriate loss function as\\n\\u2207a = \\u2207\\u03b8L(f\\u03b8, x, y). Then, the environment computes the target gradient \\u2207T = \\u2207\\u03b8L(f\\u03b8, DT ),\\nand updates model parameters w.r.t. \\u2207T + \\u2207a. Finally, the learner uses a gradient-based reward\\nRa,t(\\u2207a, \\u2207T ) to update its policy \\u03c0. See Appendix A and Lattimore & Szepesv\\u00e1ri [34] for further\\ndetails on multi-armed bandits.\\nDesigning the reward functions.\\nWe design the reward function R with our desiderata in mind.\\nTo ensure that our algorithm adds minimal memory and computational overhead we consider rewards\\nthat utilize information intrinsic to the model and the losses being optimized, not an external model\\nor metric (e.g. accuracy or BLEU). In this work we propose three gradient-based reward functions\\ninspired by previous works: gradient alignment [6, 24, 35], gradient magnitude similarity [36, 37],\\nand their aggregation. Formally, at turn t let \\u2207a be the gradient of the auxiliary batch and \\u2207T be\\nthe target dataset gradient. Gradient alignment is defined as RGA\\na,t =\\n\\u2207a\\u00b7\\u2207T\\n\\u2225\\u2207a\\u22252\\u2225\\u2207T \\u22252 , i.e. the cosine\\nsimilarity between the gradients of the sampled auxiliary dataset batch and the whole target dataset.\\nGradient magnitude similarity is defined as RGMS\\na,t\\n= 2\\u2225\\u2207a\\u22252\\u2225\\u2207T \\u22252\\n\\u2225\\u2207a\\u22252\\n2+\\u2225\\u2207T \\u22252\\n2 so that when the two gradients\\nhave equal magnitude, this value is equal to 1 and as the magnitudes differ the value goes to zero. In\\n3\\naddition to the individual reward functions, we also consider an aggregate reward. To ensure that the\\naggregate is not dominated by either individual reward, we normalize RGA \\u2208[0, 1], the same range\\nas RGMS and define the aggregate to be their sum: RAGG\\na,t\\n=\\n1+RGA\\na,t\\n2\\n+ RGMS\\na,t\\n. We provide further\\ndiscussion on the design of reward functions in Section 6.\\n3.2\\nAdapting the EXP3 algorithm.\\nEXP3 Background\\nWe base our first algorithm, EXP3-FLAD, on the EXP3 algorithm [21]\\n(\\u201cExponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation\\u201d). EXP3 targets the adversarial\\nMAB setting, which assumes that the reward-generating process is controlled by an adversary who is\\ngiven access to the learner\\u2019s policy \\u03c0 and determines the sequence of rewards, (Ra,t)N\\nt=1, for each\\narm prior to play [38]. We consider the adversarial MAB formulation due to the highly non-convex\\nloss landscape of deep neural networks and our use of stochastic gradient descent-based optimization\\nmethods. These factors imply that we cannot guarantee our rewards to be stationary, independent, or\\nfollow any particular distribution (e.g. Gaussian). Further details on adversarial MAB are included in\\nAppendix A and in [21].\\nIn EXP3-FLAD, the learner selects arms according to a Gibbs distribution based on the empirically\\ndetermined importance-weighted rewards of arms [39]. To allow for exploration, we mix the Gibbs\\ndistribution with a uniform distribution [21]. Formally, let Et be the exploration rate at turn t\\nand, recalling that K = |A| is the number of auxiliary datasets, then \\u03c0 defines the probability\\nof selecting a given arm a \\u2208A as the linear combination of Gibbs and uniform distributions\\n\\u03c0t(a) = (1 \\u2212KEt)\\nexp(Et\\u22121 \\u02c6\\nRa)\\nP\\na\\u2032 exp(Et\\u22121 \\u02c6\\nRa\\u2032) + Et where \\u02c6\\nRa,t is the importance weighted reward \\u02c6\\nRa,t =\\n\\u02c6\\nRa,t\\u22121 +\\nRa,t\\n\\u03c0t\\u22121(a). We want the learner to explore more in early training than in later stages, so we\\nuse a decaying exploration rate Et = min\\nn\\n1\\nK ,\\nq\\nln K\\nK\\u00b7t\\no\\nas proposed by Seldin et al. [39]. The use of\\nan importance-weighted estimated reward compensates the rewards of actions that are less likely to\\nbe chosen, guaranteeing that the expected estimated reward is equal to the actual reward for each\\naction. EXP3-FLAD is designed to be nearly optimal in the worst case, but due to the exploration\\nrate it will select \\u201cbad\\u201d actions at a rate of Et. The exploration of EXP3-FLAD combined with\\nimportance-weighting allows the policy to handle non-stationary reward-generating processes.\\n3.3\\nAdapting the UCB1 algorithm.\\nUCB1 background.\\nWhile EXP3-FLAD is applicable in unconstrained settings with highly stochas-\\ntic and non-stationary rewards, it can be outperformed by other algorithms in settings that are con-\\nstrained. One such algorithm is the upper confidence bound (UCB1) algorithm [22], which was\\noriginally designed to be optimal for stationary, normally distributed reward functions. Neverthe-\\nless, variants of UCB1 have been demonstrated to be effective in a range of settings, such as those\\ninvolving non-stationary, sub-Gaussian, or heavy-tailed distributions [40, 41]. The UCB1 algorithm\\nand its variants assign each arm a value called the upper confidence bound based on Hoeffding\\u2019s\\ninequality [42] and are based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty, meaning that\\nwith high probability the upper confidence bound assigned to each arm is an overestimate of the\\nunknown mean reward.\\nIn UCB1-FLAD, the learner greedily selects arms according to their upper confidence bound. UCB1\\nis originally designed for stationary reward-generating processes, so to accommodate non-stationarity\\nwe include an exponential moving average when estimating the mean reward for a given arm.\\nFormally, let Ra,t be the observed reward for arm a at turn t, then we calculate the estimated mean\\nreward as \\u02c6\\nRa = (1 \\u2212\\u03b2) \\u02c6\\nRa + \\u03b2Ra,t where \\u03b2 is the smoothing factor. Then, we define the upper\\nconfidence bound to be UCBa,t = \\u02c6\\nRa +\\nq\\n2 ln t\\nna . In the original MAB setting all interactions with\\nthe environment occur online, but FLAD is a unique situation where the learner can interact with the\\nauxiliary data prior to training. To take advantage of this, rather than initializing estimated rewards\\nwith a single mini-batch, we initialize them with larger data quantities to improve the approximation\\nof the true dataset gradients. This is done for each auxiliary dataset by calculating the gradient\\n\\u2207a = \\u2207\\u03b8L(f\\u03b8, x, y), where the number of samples in {x, y} can be significantly larger than a\\nmini-batch, and can be up to the size of the full dataset. In practice, we use 1,000 examples which is\\ncomputed in \\u223c2 minutes on a single GPU.\\n4\\nAlgorithms\\nThe EXP3-FLAD and UCB1-FLAD algorithms are visualized in Figure 1. At each\\nturn, both methods will first select an auxiliary dataset Da. EXP3-FLAD first computes the current\\nexploration rate Et and samples Da according to the distribution defined by \\u03c0t(A), while UCB1-\\nFLAD greedily selects Da\\u2217corresponding to the arm with largest upper confidence bound, a\\u2217=\\narg maxa\\u2208A UCBa,t. Next, for both methods, the environment samples a batch from the selected\\ndataset, {x, y} \\u223cDa, and calculates the gradient \\u2207a = \\u2207\\u03b8L(f\\u03b8, x, y). Let G be the number of\\nrounds between model updates, then the previous steps will repeat G times, at which point the\\nenvironment calculates the gradient of the target dataset \\u2207\\u03b8L(f\\u03b8, DT ) and updates the model w.r.t.\\n\\u2207T + P\\na \\u2207a. Finally, EXP3-FLAD calculates the importance-weighted reward for each auxiliary\\nbatch using the observed rewards, while UCB1-FLAD calculates the smoothed estimated mean\\nreward.

For EXP3-FLAD figures, we include\\ncharts of the cumulative estimated reward, empirical gradient alignment, instantaneous sampling\\ndistribution determined by the policy, and the empirical sampling distribution determined by the total\\nnumber of samples seen per dataset as a fraction of the total samples seen. For UCB1-FLAD figures,\\nwe include charts of the upper confidence index, estimated gradient alignment, and the empirical\\nsampling distribution.\\n21\\n0.0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\nUpper Confidence Bound\\namazon_polarity\\nimdb\\nkilt_tasks\\/hotpotqa\\nqasc\\nwiki_qa\\n0.75\\n0.50\\n0.25\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nEstimated\\nGradient Alignment\\n0\\n1600\\n3200\\n4800\\n6400\\n8000\\n9600\\nNumber of Auxiliary Batches Seen\\n0.02\\n0.03\\n0.04\\n0.05\\nCumulative Empirical\\nSampling Distribution\\nFigure 6: Training dynamics of UCB1-FLAD, a case study using RTE as target dataset and T0Mix as\\nauxiliary data, where UCB1-FLAD outperforms EXP3-FLAD.

We find that even\\nthough wiki_qa\\u2019s estimated gradient alignment falls to below 0 (middle), UCB1 does not abandon\\nsampling from it in the future, finding that between 3200 and 4800 batches, it becomes the dataset\\nwith largest upper confidence bound (top). Similarly, we see that UCB1 alternates between wiki_qa,\\namazon_polarity, and qasc as the datasets with higher gradient alignment and upper confidence\\nbounds. kilt_tasks\\/hotpotqa has a very high gradient alignment prior to training, but UCB1 samples\\nvery infrequently from it, due to it\\u2019ls lower upper confidence bound. This is a failure case for transfer\\nlearning-based methods. Interestingly, UCB1 never estimates imdb to have a negative gradient, and\\ngradually samples from it more and more frequently over the course of training.\\n22\\n12000\\n10000\\n8000\\n6000\\n4000\\n2000\\n0\\nCumulative\\nEstimated Reward\\namazon_polarity\\nimdb\\nkilt_tasks\\/hotpotqa\\nqasc\\nwiki_qa\\n1.00\\n0.75\\n0.50\\n0.25\\n0.00\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nGradient Alignment\\n0.00\\n0.01\\n0.02\\n0.03\\n0.04\\n0.05\\nInstantaneous\\nSampling Distribution\\n0\\n3200\\n6400\\n9600\\n12800\\nNumber of Auxiliary Batches Seen\\n0.01\\n0.02\\n0.03\\n0.04\\n0.05\\nCumulative Empirical\\nSampling Distribution\\nFigure 7: Training dynamics of EXP3-FLAD, a case study using RTE as target dataset and T0Mix\\nas auxiliary data, where UCB1-FLAD outperforms EXP3-FLAD.

We find\\nthat although qasc and quartz start with very high gradient alignment, they very quickly fall to\\nnegative alignment (middle figure, green and yellow).

Similar to RTE, we see that EXP3 never makes large\\nseparations in the empirical sampling distribution, possibly a reason why UCB1 outperforms EXP3\\noverall. Compared to RTE, we find that gradient alignments are much less variable, with a maximum\\nalignment close to 0.5 and minimum alignment close to -0.5.
