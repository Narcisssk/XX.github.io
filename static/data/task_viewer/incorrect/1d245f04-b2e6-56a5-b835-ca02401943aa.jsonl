{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

To enable\\ngenerative models in processing multiscale struc-\\ntures, there has been a surge in hierarchical design\\nmethodologies across multiple domains, spanning\\nfrom images [35, 40] to speech [20, 17]. These\\nmethods initially capture coarse-grained structures\\nand subsequently generate finer details.\\nIn the field of computer vision, recent efforts\\n[16, 42, 2, 7] have yielded successful designs of\\ncoarse-to-fine generative frameworks for 2D pix-\\nels of images, leveraging denoising diffusion mod-\\nels that corrupt and restore the data by adding and\\nremoving noises [49, 50, 52, 15, 27]. Notably,\\n[42] generates images from blurred prior distributions (average of pixel intensities) motivated from\\nthe heat equation of partial differential equations as Fig. 1.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nIn the field of biochemistry and drug discovery, however, denoising diffusion models for 3D con-\\nformers of stable molecular structures have not yet taken advantage of coarse-to-fine multiscale\\nframeworks. Current methods either disregard the scale hierarchy [46, 59, 19, 23, 60] or consider\\nthat in very limited ways [38, 41]. For instance, within the recent hierarchical method of uncondi-\\ntional conformer generation [38], a denoising diffusion model [19] is solely applied to generation of\\ncoarse-grained structure, without extending to coarse-to-fine generation.\\nThe primary bottleneck in extending denoising diffusion models for molecular conformers to hi-\\nerarchical designs is that random noise corrupts not only fine atomic details but also structural\\ninformation of coarse-grained structures indiscriminately. To tackle this challenging problem, we\\nexploit fragments that are frequently occurring substructures or functional groups in 2D molecular\\ngraphs. These fragments can be a promising candidate for the coarse-grained structural information\\nin 3D geometry. Introducing fragments divides the generation process into two stages: i) generating\\ncoarse-grained structures represented by fragments, and ii) restoring fine atomic details from fragment\\nstructures. In the first stage of generating fragment coordinates from molecular graphs, we efficiently\\ngenerate approximations of fragment structures comprising the center of mass and attributes of each\\nfragment from a cheminformatics tool.\\nFor the challenging second step of coarse-to-fine generation, we propose a novel diffusion model,\\nEquivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD) detailed as follows. Motivated from the blurring corruption of\\nthe heat equation [42], we design EBD to generate 3D molecular conformers from coarse-grained\\nfragment approximated structures as Fig. 1, rather than from random noise. In our design of EBD, the\\nforward process moves atom positions of conformers towards the center of mass of their respective\\nfragments, while the reverse process restores full-atom details from the prior distribution of the 3D\\nfragment structure. The blurring schedule we designed for EBD allows the diffusion model to focus\\non restoring fine atomic details while retaining coarse-grained information throughout the entire\\ngenerative process. We validated our coarse-to-fine EBD model using a benchmark of drug-like\\nmolecules. We obtained superior results in conformer generation compared to the denoising diffusion\\nmodel, even with 100 times fewer diffusion time steps.\\nThe major contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 We design EBD which generates atomic details from coarse-grained estimation of fragment\\nstructures using equivariant networks, motivated by the blurring corruption of heat equation.\\n\\u2022 We propose a novel blurring scheduler and a revised loss function that significantly impacts\\nperformance, instead of directly applying those of existing image blurring diffusion model.\\n\\u2022 We conduct a thorough analysis of the effects of fragment granularity, data corruption\\nmethods, and loss reformulation. We obtained geometrically and chemically more plausible\\nconformers compared to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Background\\n2.1\\nBlurring diffusion\\nThe denoising diffusion models [49, 50, 52, 15, 27], which corrupt data by adding random noise and\\ngenerate data through denoising, have significantly advanced across diverse domains [55, 54, 44].\\nRecently, a few works [2, 42, 7, 18] have introduced data corruption into the design space of diffusion\\nmodels [26], going beyond random noise corruption in the vision domain.\\nInverse Heat Dissipation Model (IHDM) [42] proposed a coarse-to-fine generation in the pixel space.\\nTheir forward process follows a partial differential equation of heat dissipation on grids:\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202tx(i, j, t) = \\u2206x(i, j, t),\\n(1)\\nwhere x represents the data on the grid and \\u2206is the Laplacian operator. IHDM derived the solution\\nof this equation at time step t, xt, using eigendecomposition of \\u2206as:\\nxt = Btx0 = V exp(\\u2212\\u039bt)VT x0,\\n(2)\\nwhere VT and \\u039b are discrete cosine transform and a diagonal matrix whose elements are eigenvalues\\nof \\u2206, respectively. As t \\u2192T, the eigenbasis of eigenvalue 0 only remains and this leads to the\\n2\\nconvergence of pixel intensities to their average value. Based upon this blurring process, IHDM\\ndefined a forward process as:\\nq(xt|x0) = N(xt|Btx0, \\u03c32I),\\n(3)\\nwhich means that the state at t is equal to the data blurred until t with small amount of noise. Note\\nthat the function of data corruption Bt was defined at a spectral space of eigenvalues \\u039b. Then, the\\nreverse generative process was defined to deblur each state:\\np\\u03b8(xt\\u22121|xt) = N(xt\\u22121|\\u00b5\\u03b8(xt, t), \\u03b42I),\\n(4)\\nwhere the mean at t \\u22121 is the result of a deblurring network \\u00b5\\u03b8 and \\u03b4 is the small amount of\\nstandard deviation for noise. As t approaches 0, \\u00b5\\u03b8 gradually restores fine details from coarse-grained\\ninformation about pixel intensities by effectively deblurring state values. The loss was defined to\\nminimize the distance between the result of deblurring network and less blurred state at randomly\\nsampled t as:\\nLt\\u22121 = Et,x0,xt[\\u2225Bt\\u22121x0 \\u2212\\u00b5\\u03b8(xt, t)\\u22252].\\n(5)\\nIHDM was evaluated on image generation task using FID score [14], but its performance lagged\\nbehind that of denoising diffusion models. For instance, IHDM achieves an FID score of 18.96 while\\nDDPM [15] have 3.17 on CIFAR-10 [30].\\n2.2\\nEquivariance\\nIn this work, we consider the SE(3) group to address the roto-translational equivariance of molecular\\nconformers [28, 19, 59]. A function f is equivariant to a group G if Tg(f(x)) = f(Sg(x)) holds for\\nall g \\u2208G, where Tg, Sg are transformations of the group element g. In our coarse-to-fine generative\\nframework, the invariant prior distribution of coarse-grained structure represents the coordinates of\\nfragments. Therefore, the design of the transition distribution and the loss function in our diffusion\\nmodel need to ensure that the generated likelihood is invariant, so that the generated conformers are\\nnot affected by rotation or translation.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Methods\\n3.1\\nProblem definition\\nSuppose that we have a molecular graph G whose nodes V are n atoms with SE(3)-invariant features\\nha \\u2208Rn\\u00d7d and edges E are inter-atomic bonds. Our objective is to generate an ensemble of 3D\\nmolecular conformers xa \\u2208Rn\\u00d73 given G. Our hierarchical approach is in two stages. i) p(xf|G):\\ngenerating a coarse-grained 3D structure of fragment coordinates xf \\u2208Rm\\u00d73 from G which was\\ndecomposed into m fragments, and ii) p(xa|xf, G): the diffusion model generating fine atomic details\\nxa \\u2208Rn\\u00d73 conditioned on the generated fragment structure xf. To map between atoms and their\\nrespective fragments, we defined a mapping matrix M \\u2208Rn\\u00d7m with Mik = 1 if the i-th atom\\nbelongs to the k-th fragment and 0 otherwise. Mxf makes each atom located at its respective fragment.\\nOn the other hand, M\\u2020xa results in fragment coordinates being the average of the coordinates of its\\nconstituent atoms, where M\\u2020 is a pseudoinverse matrix of M (M\\u2020M = I).\\n3.2\\nFragmentation and 3D fragment structures\\nWe decompose a molecule G = (V, E) into m non-overlapping fragments {Sk}m\\nk=1, where Sk =\\n(Vk, Ek) and V = Sm\\nk=1 Vk, E = Sm\\nk=1 Ek using Principal Subgraph (PS) [29]. Starting from all\\nunique atoms in the fragment vocabulary S, PS iteratively merges neighboring fragments. The most\\nfrequent fragment among the newly merged fragments was added to the vocabulary at each iteration,\\nwhich was repeated until the desired size of the vocabulary was reached. The smaller the size of\\nfragment vocabulary, the finer fragments and detailed coarse-grained structures can be obtained. After\\nfragmentation was finished, from the relation between {Vk}m\\nk=1 and V, the mapping matrix M can\\nbe constructed.\\nTo generate the initial coordinates of fragments, we utilize RDKit distance geometry [5, 31], an\\nefficient cheminformatics tool, instead of training an additional deep generative model. After\\ngenerating initial atom coordinates \\u02c6\\nxa \\u223cpRDKit(xa), we define the initial fragment coordinates xf\\nas averages of their constituent atom coordinates, M\\u2020\\u02c6\\nxa. Since the atom coordinates generated by\\n3\\nFigure 2: Our hierarchical molecular conformer generation framework. We first decompose a\\nmolecular graph G into fragments and generate fragment coordinates \\u02c6\\nxf. Then, conditioned on \\u02c6\\nxf\\nand G, Equivariant Blurring Diffusion generates atom-level fine details using the blurring schedule.\\nRDKit are approximations of the ground truth conformer, the resulting fragment coordinates are\\nalso an approximation (thus need to be adjusted in the next stage in Sec. 3.3), which we denote as\\n\\u02c6\\nxf \\u223cpRDKit(xf). For fragment features hf \\u2208Rm\\u00d73, we define a 3-dimensional vector as a frequency\\nhistogram of its constituent atom types based on their chemical properties, including hydrophobicity,\\nhydrogen bond center, and negative charge center following [38].\\nThe processes of fragment structure generation are illustrated in the step 1 of Fig. 2. Note that every\\nstep in this subsection does not harm the efficiency of our framework, as they can be completed\\nbefore training our diffusion model and the process itself is efficient. To generate 5 distinct fragment\\ncoordinates \\u02c6\\nxf for each of the 45, 000 molecules in the training and validation set of the GEOM-Drug\\nbenchmark [1], it took 38 hours, averaging 3.04 seconds per molecule. The details of fragmentation\\nand fragment vocabulary are demonstrated in Appendix C.1.\\n3.3\\nEquivariant blurring diffusion\\nIn this subsection, we elaborate on the design of our diffusion model, Equivariant Blurring Diffusion\\n(EBD), drawing inspiration from the principles of the heat equation. This model is designed to\\ngenerate fine details of conformers xa, starting from a coarse-grained, approximate structure \\u02c6\\nxf and a\\nmolecular graph G. We introduce a forward process and a data corruption function of blurring process\\nin Sec. 3.3.1, a reverse process and a deblurring network to reach an SE(3)-invariant likelihood in\\nSec. 3.3.2, and a definition and reparameterization of an SE(3)-invariant loss function in Sec. 3.3.3.\\nThe overall scheme of EBD is illustrated in the step 2 of Fig. 2.\\n3.3.1\\nForward process and blurring schedule\\nWe define the data corruption of the forward process as a blurring operation that gradually shifts\\nground truth atom positions xa\\n0 \\u223cq(xa\\n0) to their corresponding fragment coordinates:\\nq(xa\\nt|xa\\n0, \\u02c6\\nxf) = N(xa\\nt|fB(xa\\n0, \\u02c6\\nxf, t), \\u03c32I),\\n(6)\\nwhere fB is a deterministic blurring operator. Consequently, every atom will be positioned according\\nto its fragment coordinates M\\u02c6\\nxf in the prior fragment structure distribution.\\nWhen defining fB for the forward process, we cannot directly adopt the spectral blurring operator\\nBt = V exp(\\u2212\\u039bt)VT of IHDM [42] in Eq. (2) for the two reasons: i) For a single molecule, we\\nneed to calculate and decompose the fragment graph Laplacian {Vk\\u039bkVT\\nk }m\\nk=1 for each fragment\\nSk = (Vk, Ek), unlike a single Laplacian operator per image in IHDM. Given the varying sizes and\\nstructures across fragments, it becomes challenging to uniformly adjust the movement of atoms\\nacross all fragments using a function of {\\u039bk}m\\nk=1 in spectral space. ii) As t \\u2192T, the ground truth\\natom coordinates xa\\n0 will converge to the ground truth scaffold structure xf = BT xa\\n0 by spectral\\n4\\ngraph theory [4]. However, there exists a mismatch between the ground truth coordinates xf and the\\napproximation coordinates \\u02c6\\nxf from RDKit in the generative processes. This distributional shift of the\\nfragment structure can potentially harm the performance during the inference.\\nTo circumvent these issues, we transition the space of the blurring operator from spectral domain\\nto spatial domain while retaining the essence of the blurring process. We define fB as a linear\\ninterpolation between M\\u02c6\\nxf and xa\\n0 in Euclidean space:\\nfB(xa\\n0, \\u02c6\\nxf, t) = (1 \\u2212t\\nT )xa\\n0 + t\\nT M\\u02c6\\nxf.\\n(7)\\nAs t progresses from 0 to T, the atom coordinates xa\\nt will gradually converge to the fragment structure\\nM\\u02c6\\nxf, allowing for uniform adjustment of atom movement. Additionally, we can mitigate the need\\nfor excessive eigendecomposition of the fragment graph Laplacian. The example of our blurring\\nschedule on a single fragment is depicted in the step 2 of Fig. 2.\\n3.3.2\\nReverse process and deblurring networks\\nThe aim of the reverse process is to generate fine details at the atom-level from a prior distribution\\nof 3D fragment structure p(xa\\nT ) = N(xa\\nT |M\\u02c6\\nxf, \\u03b42I) that is roto-translational invariant to the group.\\nDrawing upon proofs regarding the conditions for an invariant likelihood [28, 59], we develop the\\ndeblurring process on the zero center-of-mass subspace using equivariant transition distributions:\\np\\u03b8(xa\\nt\\u22121|xa\\nt, \\u02c6\\nxf, G) = N(xa\\nt\\u22121|\\u00b5\\u03b8(xa\\nt, \\u02c6\\nxf, G, t), \\u03b42I),\\n(8)\\nwhere \\u00b5\\u03b8 is a parameterized mean function consisting of a deblurring network. To ensure equivariance\\nin the transition distribution, we devise \\u00b5\\u03b8 inspired by equivariant networks [45]. Our equivariant\\ndeblurring network updates invariant features of fragments and atoms hf, ha, (Eqs. (9, 10)), and the\\nequivariant coordinates of atoms xa (Eq. (11)) by leveraging the hierarchical relationship between\\natoms and fragments. Let the i-th atom xa\\ni belongs to the k-th fragment xf\\nk, then the l-th layer of\\nequivariant deblurring networks for fragment- and atom-level message passing and feature updates is\\ndefined as follows:\\nmf\\nij = \\u03d5f\\nm(hf,l\\ni , hf,l\\nj , \\u2225xf\\ni \\u2212xf\\nj\\u2225),\\nhf,l+1\\ni\\n= \\u03d5f\\nh(hf,l\\ni ,\\nX\\nj\\u2208N(xf\\ni) mf\\nij, ha,l),\\n(9)\\nma\\nij = \\u03d5a\\nm(ha,l\\ni , ha,l\\nj , \\u2225xa,l\\ni \\u2212xa,l\\nj \\u2225, ea\\nij),\\nha,l+1\\ni\\n= \\u03d5a\\nh(ha,l\\ni ,\\nX\\nj\\u2208N(xa\\ni) ma\\nij, hf,l+1),\\n(10)\\nxa,l+1\\ni\\n= xa,l\\ni +\\nX\\nj\\u2208N(xa\\ni)\\nxa,l\\ni \\u2212xa,l\\nj\\nda,l\\nij + 1\\n\\u03d5a\\nx(ha,l+1\\ni\\n, ha,l+1\\nj\\n, ma\\nij, ea\\nij)\\n+\\nxa,l\\ni \\u2212xf\\nk\\n\\u2225xa,l\\ni \\u2212xf\\nk\\u2225+ 1\\n\\u03d5f\\nx(ha,l+1\\ni\\n, hf,l+1\\nk\\n, \\u2225xa,l\\ni \\u2212xf\\nk\\u2225),\\n(11)\\nwhere xf\\nk is the k-th row of M\\u2020xa\\nt, \\u03d5 are multilayer perceptrons, ea\\nij are inter-atomic bond types, and\\nda,l\\nij = \\u2225xa,l\\ni \\u2212xa,l\\nj \\u2225are inter-atomic distances. We consider a complete graph for fragment-level\\ninteractions and expand the edge set by incorporating multi-hop and radius neighbors for atom-level\\ninteractions. The details of the deblurring networks are provided in the Appendix A.\\n3.3.3\\nTraining\\nFollowing Eq. (5) of IHDM [42], our loss of previous deblurred state estimation can be defined as:\\nLt\\u22121 = Et,xa\\n0,xa\\nt,\\u02c6\\nxf[\\u2225fB(xa\\n0, \\u02c6\\nxf, t \\u22121) \\u2212\\u03c1\\n\\u0000\\u00b5\\u03b8(xa\\nt, \\u02c6\\nxf, G, t)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u22252],\\n(12)\\nwhere \\u03c1 is the Kabsch algorithm [25] to obtain the optimal rotation matrix for alignment. Through\\nalignment \\u03c1 between the prediction from \\u00b5\\u03b8 and less blurred state fB(xa\\n0, \\u02c6\\nxf, t \\u22121) after translating\\nboth terms to the zero center-of-mass subspace, the loss function becomes invariant to the SE(3)-\\ntransformation of the prediction.\\nHowever, we empirically observed that this previous state estimator generates unsatisfactory\\nconformers, similar to the unsatisfactory FID scores observed in image generation of IHDM\\n[42]. We conjectured the reason as the model limited to learn the locally small steps towards\\nthe ground truth distribution at each time step [7].
