{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

For the input entity sequence of Legal-LUKE, the legal entities from the training set are used to fne-tune the model. Although we cannot access the test set before the task organizers open the evaluation system, we train and tune our models and baselines based on the training and validation set.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2 Results of Rhetorical Role Classifcation\",\"section_content\":\"The goal of rhetorical role classifcation is to provide a categorization label for each sentence at the unstructured document level. The number of classes is 13. The training set has 247 documents with a total sentence number of 30k, validation set has 30 documents with a total sentence number of $3\\\\mathbf{k}$ . In this section, all evaluations are reported based on the validation set.\\nTable 1 shows the summary of micro F1 scores for Legal-BERT-HSLN and the baselines on the validation set, where Legal-BERT-HSLN signifcantly outperforms all baselines and it takes more epochs to converge, where we believe Legal-BERTHSLN has the better capacity to understand legal documents. It is worth mentioning that the regularization process decreased the F1 score and suggests that the rhetorical role is sensitive to detailed stop words and external sentence markers.\\nWhile our initial design choice was not Legal\\nBERT-HSLN, we originally trained the baseline models. Specifcally, our frst design choice was to treat all sentences as individual elements where they have no correlation to each other. We set the baseline model with the BERT network backbone with a simple multilayer perceptron. The resulting confusion matrix is shown in Figure 3 with the micro F1 0.631. Subsequently, we conducted 3 BERT variants with minor modifcations and obtained the performance shown in Table 1. From the results, we observed the signifcant performance gap between all the BERT baselines and the stateof-the-art solution (Kalamkar et al., 2022b).\\nTo fully understand the problem, we put an effort into examining the distribution of the legal dataset (Modi et al., 2023) in term of sentence length and classes. In Figure 4 (A), the sentence lengths overall satisfed Poisson\\u2019s distribution but there is a signifcant noise at $<\\\\!20$ levels. These short sentences may infuence the accuracy of classifcation due to a lack of meaningful information. For example, sentences 17928, 17929, and 17930 are \\\"[326C-E\\\", $\\\"J~2.\\\"$ , and \\\"There may be circumstances where expenditure, even if incurred for obtaining advantage of enduring beneft would not amount to acquisition of asset\\\", respectively, whose ground-truth labels are all PREMABLE. This might be due to the discontinuous annotation from turning the page or a keyboard input mistake. Therefore, model prediction from the sentence level is likely not an optimal paradigm to proceed. In Figure 4 (B), we found that there is a signifcant bias of the labeling in the training set; therefore, we believe that more experiments, such as validating the label bias, can be tested for future research.\\nExcept for the design choices, we also evaluate the effectiveness of our hyper-parameters. Figure 5 shows the micro F1 score is infuenced by the batch size, maximum sentence length, and learning rate, where the best combination we have tested so far is batch size 16, maximum sentence length 32, learning rate $1\\\\,\\\\times\\\\,10^{-4}$ . All weighted-F1 scores in Figure 5 are calculated from sklearn.metrics.f1_score function with the weighted option. Figure 6 shows the confusion matrix using this combination of hyperparameters, and it is found that the best Micro F1 score we achieve in the validation set is 0.828. Although the major error contribution is no longer in the PREMABLE label, the accuracy of the PRE_NOT_RELIED label is 0 which is the same as reported by the state-of-the-art solution (Kalamkar et al., 2022b). For future experiments, we suggest studying this outlier effect.\\n\\nPerformance on Test Set After the task organizer released the test, we test Legal-BEST-HSLN and submitted the predictions. Surprisingly, we obtained the micro F1 score of 0.8343 and ranked No. 5 out of 27 teams. Note that the test performance is better than all performance on the validation set. Therefore, we believe that there is a shift in the distribution of the training, validation, and test sets.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.3 Results of Legal Named Entity Recognition\",\"section_content\":\"Table 2 presents the overall performance of LegalLUKE and the baseline models for legal named entity recognition on the validation set. We observe that Legal-LUKE outperforms all baselines with an up to $14.3\\\\%$ better micro F1 score.\\nMoreover, among the baselines, the BERT-Span model is better than the BERT-CRF model where we used the same encoder model but different pre\\nTable 2: Overall Performance on Validation Set of Legal Named Entity Recognition\\ndiction heads, which demonstrates the benefts of using the span boundary representations for the named entity recognition task. Moreover, the XLMroBERTa encoder model shows better legal text encoding capacity because the XLM-roBERTa-CRF model and BERT-CRF model share the same decoder module, but XLM-roBERTa-CRF outperforms BERT-CRF with a $11.4\\\\%$ better F1 score. Note that we gave the same parameters for the baseline models. For example, we consider context information by a natural language preprocessor with a maximum length of 100. To balance train effciency and performance, we set the batch size per GPU as 16 with a learning rate scheduler whose initial rate is $5.0\\\\times10^{-6}$ and the AdamW optimizer. Although we set the maximum number of epochs as 10, we observed that all models achieved the best performance at early epochs. For example, Figure 7 shows the best performance of the XLMroBERTa-CRF baseline model on the validation set in different epochs, which shows the convergence effect as the training epoch increases.\\nFor our Legal-LUKE model, we also use a learning rate scheduler that has a warm-up ratio of 0.06, the same initial rate $5.0\\\\!\\\\times\\\\!10^{-6}$ as baselines, and the AdamW optimizer. While the pre-trained LUKE model is too large for our GPU server, we tune the different batch sizes to trade off between training speed and performance, and eventually we set the batch size as 8. Similar to the baseline models, we also observe the performance convergence (as shown in Figure 8) though we set the maximum epoch number at 100.\\n\\nPerformance on Test Set After the task organizer released the test, we evaluated Legal-LUKE on the test set and submitted the predictions. We obtained an F1 score of 0.667 and ranked No. 13 out of 17 teams. Our test F1 score is far lower than the validation F1 score. However, according to the dataset (Kalamkar et al., 2022a), the validation set and test set should have similar distributions as they are from the same group of legal cases. Our hypothesis is that the event organizer adopted a different preprocessor from ours which produces different token indices and label shifts. For example, we observed that the legal documents contain many empty lines and we opted to remove such lines in our processing, which can result in the different token indices in our predictions. We plan to further investigate the root cause upon the release of the test set.\"}\n\nIn total, 3 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
