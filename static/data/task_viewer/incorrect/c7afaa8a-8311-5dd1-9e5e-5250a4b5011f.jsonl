{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. IN THE RESPONSE, YOU SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN ONE TURN, THAT IS TO SAY, YOU SHOULD OUTPUT EXACTLY ONE THOUGHT AND ONTE ACTION. Now, let's start!\n"}

We consider a series of input vectors xt \\u2208RD given at a certain time\\nstep t \\u2208{1, . . . , T}. X = X1:T = (x1, x2, . . . , xT ) \\u2208RD\\u00d7T denotes the matrix of stacked input\\nvectors from all time steps. Both sLSTM and mLSTM are recurrent neural networks, which either\\nmap a state (ht\\u22121, ct\\u22121, nt\\u22121) to a successor state (ht, ct, nt) given an input xt\\u22121 (sLSTM) or\\na state (ht\\u22121, Ct\\u22121, nt\\u22121) to a successor state (ht, Ct, nt) given an input xt\\u22121 (mLSTM). Here,\\nht \\u2208Rd denotes a hidden state, ct \\u2208Rd and Ct \\u2208Rd\\u00d7d denote cell states responsible for long-term\\nmemory and, nt \\u2208Rd denotes a normalizer state. sLSTM and mLSTM utilize several adjustable\\nweight matrices and bias vectors (detailed equations below) and employ input-, output-, and forget-\\ngates, activated by exponential (exp) or the sigmoid functions (\\u03c3). For cell inputs in sLSTM, the\\nhyperbolic tangent function (tanh, abbreviated as \\u03c6) is used as an activation function.\\n2.1\\nBlock Structures\\nThe sLSTM and mLSTM layers are integrated into larger residual backbones (Srivastava et al., 2015;\\nHe et al., 2016), which incorporate layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), pre- or post-up projection\\nlayers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dao, 2024), with short causal convolutions and group normalization\\n(Wu and He, 2020). Figure A1 depicts sLSTM and mLSTM blocks, as well as, a bidirectional\\nmLSTM configuration with weight-tied blocks. For more details, refer to (Beck et al., 2024, Sec.2.4).\\nFor Bio-xLSTM we retain these basic building blocks but adjust them to the respective domains.\\nThe entire architecture, including all layers, normalization, blocks, and other components, defines\\na mapping from an input sequence of length t to an output sequence. This mapping is denoted\\nas xLSTM : RD\\u00d7t 7\\u2192RD\\u00d7t, where xLSTM transforms the stacked inputs up to time step t, i.e.,\\nX1:t := (x1, x2, . . . , xt) \\u2208RD\\u00d7t, to the corresponding stacked outputs of sequence length t, i.e.,\\nY1:t := (y1, y2, . . . , yt) \\u2208RD\\u00d7t 1. The i-th sequence element is denoted with the subscript i, e.g.\\nthe i-th element from X1:t would be (X1:t)i. Similarly to the mapping xLSTM, we also define\\nmappings for the sequence-wise input-\\/output behaviour of layers themselves for an sLSTM layer\\n(sLSTM : RD\\u00d7t 7\\u2192RD\\u00d7t) or an mLSTM layer (mLSTM : RD\\u00d7t 7\\u2192RD\\u00d7t). If the specific\\nparameters used for the mapping are unclear, we will denote this by including a second argument in\\nthe function, separated by a semicolon. For details on the block structures, see Appendix Section B.3.\\n2.2\\nModes of Operation: Parallel, Chunkwise, and Recurrent\\nThe recurrent forms of sLSTM and mLSTM, introduced in Sections B.1 and B.2, provide efficient,\\nconstant-memory decoding during inference. This eliminates the need for expensive key-value\\ncaching, which represents a major challenge for Transformer models in long-range settings. Like\\nTransformers, mLSTM allows for parallelization across the sequence length which significantly\\nspeeds up training. Additionally, similar to linear attention variants (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Yang\\net al., 2024), mLSTM supports chunkwise parallel processing, blending recurrent and parallel modes\\n1Here xi and yi represent the inputs to and outputs from a particular model from an instance of an xLSTM\\narchitecture, rather than the inputs and outputs of a specific sLSTM or mLSTM layer\\n3\\n(Beck et al., 2025).

Understanding human cognition as optimal and\\ngeneral under limitations of time, computation and communication ([6]), might help us formalize and\\nintroduce these patterns of human behavior as inductive biases in AI systems that need to coordinate\\nwith humans. Towards this goal, we take into account two human limitations: (1) limitation on human\\nreaction speed to situational changes, and, (2) preference for immediate over future rewards [1].\\nAvailability of Data.

The Q-function can be interpreted as the negated energy and it has a very special\\nsemantics: Q(s, a) stands for the total reward obtained by an agent applying action a in state s and\\nthen following optimal policy. Consequently, the training of the (neural network) approximation b\\nQ of\\nQ leverages the fact that Q is a fixed point of the so-called Bellman operator (Bellman (1954); Song\\net al. (2019)). Furthermore, learning the Q-function is an off-policy process and the argmin-defined\\npolicy is applied only after Q-learning is completed. The setting considered in this paper is more\\ngeneral - the energy E lacks the semantics of the negated Q-function which enables us to bypass the\\nseparate off-policy training of E. The algorithms presented in this paper are in fact on-policy.\\nEnergy-based Models:\\nImplicit policies can be viewed as special instantiations of energy-based\\nmodels (EBMs) (see: LeCun et al.

We mention Transformers here on purpose.\\nIn ITTs the energy is the dot product of latent action and negated latent state. Thus, ITTs can\\nbe interpreted as learning the cross-attention between the state and action-spaces with actions\\ncorresponding to keys and states to queries.\\n\\u2026\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\naction-tower\\nstate-tower\\n\\u2026\\n\\u2026\\nK\\n,\\nFigure 1: The conceptual description of the Implicit Two-Tower (ITT) stack.

Recent works in circuit analysis provide detailed explanations of how different\\nmodel components interact on controlled datasets. In particular, we make use of the Indirect Object\\nIdentification (IOI) circuit discovered in Wang et al. [2022]. We use GPT2-Small, to study three\\nspecific types of interactions between heads: cases where heads write information that is used by the\\nkeys, queries, or values of later heads.\\nWhen we refer to an attention head as 3.0 or 7.9, this means layer 3, head 0 or layer 7 head 9.\\nThree Types of Composition\\nIn attention heads, there are three ways that earlier heads can\\ncontribute to the processing done downstream. In all cases, information is written into the residual\\nstream by the OV matrix of an earlier head, and read back out by either the Query, Key, or Value\\nmatrices of a later head. These concepts are introduced in Elhage et al. [2021]. We also provide an\\nexample of each composition type that we examine further in Section 3. We look for communication\\nchannels in one of each type of composition. These are previous token to induction head composition\\n(key) [Olsson et al., 2022, Singh et al., 2024, Reddy, 2023], duplicate token to inhibition head\\ncomposition (value), and inhibition to mover head composition (query) [Wang et al., 2022]. The\\nvariation in the way these heads communicate only changes how we calculate the composition score\\n[Elhage et al., 2021] and individual implementation of the communication, but we do not make claims\\nabout how these types of composition differ from each other in more meaningful ways.\\nThe Inhibition-Mover Subcircuit\\nWe build on work from IOI [Wang et al., 2022] which documents\\na circuit that appears in multiple tasks [Merullo et al., 2024]. This circuit includes mover heads, which\\ncopy tokens from context to the output, and inhibition heads which (optionally) block the mover\\nheads\\u2019 attention to certain tokens and thus prevent certain tokens from being copied. Inhibition heads\\nare known to receive signals from duplicate token head value vectors which help inform which tokens\\nto inhibit. In GPT2-Small, the known inhibition heads are 7.3, 7.9, 8,6, and 8.10 and we consider\\ntheir communication to the mover head 9.93. This is the example we use for query composition\\nexperiments.

Although the precise cognitive mechanisms\\nbehind inductive reasoning remain unknown, one compelling hypothesis in cognitive science posits\\nthat humans approach this challenge through an iterative process that involves proposing hypothe-\\nses, testing them against observations, and refining them accordingly (Heit, 2000; Fr\\u00a8\\nanken et al.,\\n2022). Returning to the above example, while the hypothesis \\u201cselecting the smallest item\\u201d may\\nseem plausible based on the first two examples, applying this rule to the final example reveals the\\nneed for refinement, ultimately favoring \\u201cselecting the first item\\u201d as a more accurate hypothesis.\\nWith the increasing power of state-of-the-art LMs (OpenAI, 2023; Anthropic, 2023), there is grow-\\ning interest in exploring these models\\u2019 reasoning capabilities vis-`\\na-vis human inductive reasoning.\\nHow are their performances and underlying mechanisms similar to (and contrasted with) those of\\nhumans?

Specifically, we use an\\nLM to propose a set of free-form or constrained hypotheses based on observations. The proposed\\nhypotheses are then verified against observations via off-the-shelf symbolic interpreters2, e.g., gram-\\nmar parsers or code interpreters, which can determine if an hypothesis applies to specific instances.\\nThe hypothesis that covers most number of observations is then selected to be further refined by the\\nLM. This process is repeated to induce the final hypothesis.\\nResults across four distinct tasks, including inducing causal relations (Zhang et al., 2021), language-\\nlike compositional instructions (Lake et al., 2019), symbolic operations (Rule, 2020), and visual\\nconcepts (Kim et al., 2022b), show that this iterative hypothesis refinement process significantly\\nimproves upon standard input-output (IO) prompting. We find that LMs are particularly good at\\ngenerating candidate rules, and when coupled with a symbolic interpreter that can provide accurate\\nfeedback with which to refine hypotheses, this hybrid induction approach is effective.\\nHowever, a closer inspection of the refinement pipeline reveals a more nuanced view of the putative\\ninductive reasoning process of LMs. Despite being able to generate plausible candidate rules, LMs\\ndisplay a range of puzzling counterintuitive behaviors. For one, while we might expect humans to be\\nable to apply the rules they propose, we find that LMs are often unable to correctly apply their own\\nproposed rules (\\u00a74.1). Moreover, while humans can make robust inductions by abstracting away\\nfrom small perturbations present in examples (e.g., different representational forms of examples),\\nwe observe LMs to be highly brittle in the face of even minor perturbations (\\u00a74.2). Finally, a human\\nstudy reveals that rules induced by LMs generally have different content and form compared to\\nrules generated by humans. LMs often provide verbose descriptions of patterns but fail to leverage\\npragmatic communication strategies commonly seen in human induction (\\u00a74.3).\\nOur study unveils the paradoxical inductive capabilities of LMs: they are simultaneously phenom-\\nenal hypothesis proposers and puzzling inductive reasoners. Our paper connects to classical ap-\\nproaches for concept induction (Tenenbaum et al., 2011; Ellis et al., 2023, i.a.), latent language\\noptimization (Andreas et al., 2018; Mu et al., 2020, i.a.), and instruction induction (Honovich et al.,\\n2023). While similar in spirit to recent work on exploring inductive reasoning with LMs (Wang\\net al., 2023a), our work offers a nuanced exploration of both the potentials and limitations of LMs.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"INDUCTIVE REASONING WITH LMS: EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nWe consider the rule induction problem of inferring a function f : X \\u2192Y that maps an input x \\u2208X\\nto an output y \\u2208Y.

The goal is to induce the f that best describes D\\u03c4 using only Ds\\n\\u03c4. A\\ngood rule thus requires a balance between precision and coverage, i.e., it should be simultaneously\\nexpressive enough to capture Ds\\n\\u03c4 and generalizable to Du\\n\\u03c4 .\\nWe assess an LM\\u2019s ability to induce rules through prompting.

We then select the best rule based on scores calculated using the interpreter\\nfunction. We provide feedback to LMs for further refinement. See Figure 1 for an overview.\\nSpecifically, given k exemplars Ds\\n\\u03c4 = {(x1, y1), ..., (xk, yk)}, at iteration t, we sample N hypothe-\\nses of rules, Ht = {ht\\n1, ..., ht\\nN}, from a prompted LM,\\nht \\u223cPLM\\n\\u0000\\u00b7 |dt\\u22121, x1, y1, ..., xk, yk),\\n(4)\\nwhere dt\\u22121 is the feedback from previous iterations and which is set to be an empty string at the\\ninitial iteration.

The iteration stops if the interpreter produces correct outputs\\nfor all exemplars using the current hypothesis or if the maximum iteration T is reached. In all ex-\\nperiments, we consider a combination of maximum number of iterations T \\u2208{1, 3} and number of\\nhypotheses per iteration N \\u2208{1, 5}. We use greedy decoding when generating a single hypothesis\\nand set the temperature to 0.7 when generating multiple hypotheses following Wang et al. (2023b).\\n3For example, if h is the string representation of a Python function, I\\u03c4(h) can be the actual Python function.\\nNote that the same rule h could be applied differently by different interpreters.\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n2.2\\nDATASETS\\nThe above framework requires three specifications: the rule function f, the representation (i.e., the\\nformat and content) of h, and the interpreter I. We evaluate on 4 datasets (where each dataset\\nconsists of multiple tasks) and formulate these specifications as follows (see examples in Figure 1).\\nWe show the full dataset details in Appendix A.\\nACRE.\\nThe Abstract Causal REasoning (ACRE; Zhang et al., 2021) is a diagnostic dataset de-\\nsigned to evaluate causal induction ability. It requires identifying a set of \\u201cBlicket\\u201d objects that will\\ntrigger a special machine. We can view f as an indicator function s.t. f(x; B) = 1[B \\u2229x] where\\nB is the set of Blickets and x is the presented objects. We constrain h to classify each object into\\none of three categories: a Blicket, not a Blicket, or undetermined. I\\n\\u0000h)(x) is thus a deterministic\\nfunction that checks the intersections between current objects and predicted Blickets.\\nMiniSCAN.\\nLake et al. (2019) developed a sequence-to-sequence task with only 14 training ex-\\namples to measure few-shot concept learning ability. We refer to this as MiniSCAN following Nye\\net al. (2020).4 Similar to SCAN (Lake & Baroni, 2018), MiniSCAN requires translating an input\\ncommand x to an output action sequence y. We consider f as a set of grammar rules that map the\\ninput symbols to the corresponding meaning representations. We use a quasi-synchronous context\\nfree grammar (Smith & Eisner, 2006) as our formalism for h and use a parser as our interpreter I(h).\\nList Functions.\\nThe List Functions dataset (Rule, 2020) is designed to evaluate human and ma-\\nchine concept learning ability. It requires identifying a function that maps the input list to its corre-\\nsponding output list. Here f is a primitive or compositional list operation. We represent h as natural\\nlanguage description and implement the interpreter I using a two-stage process. First, we ask an LM\\nto translate the natural language hypothesis h into a Python program. Then we execute this program\\nto produce the corresponding outputs for given inputs.5\\nMiniARC.\\nThe Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC; Chollet, 2019) and its variants (Kim et al.,\\n2022b; Acquaviva et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023b; Moskvichev et al., 2023) aim to evaluate visual\\nabstract reasoning over broad concepts. The f here involves a transformation between input and\\noutput 2D grids, such as moving an object or swapping colors. We use natural language hypotheses\\nh and similarly interpret the hypotheses using a Python interpreter. Given the extensive grid size of\\nthe original ARC tasks and the limited context length of LMs, we consider MiniARC (Kim et al.,\\n2022b), a 5x5 compact version of the ARC.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"LMS ARE PHENOMENAL HYPOTHESIS PROPOSERS\\nMain Results.\\nWe compare hypothesis refinement with standard input-output (IO) prompting,\\nself-consistency prompting (SC; Wang et al., 2023b), and self-refine (SR; Madaan et al., 2023).6 SC\\nsamples multiple outputs and selects the most consistent one by taking a majority vote.

For OOD evaluations, we sample longer lists for List\\nFunctions and annotate larger grids for MiniARC. IO prompting generally experiences more signif-\\nicant performance degradation compared to rule prompting (i.e., iterative hypothesis refinement).\\nformance, leading to the best accuracy on the majority of datasets.8 It is important to emphasize that\\nboth iterative refinement and external feedback are essential. Simply sampling more predictions and\\ntaking a majority vote (as SC prompting), does not necessarily improve performance. This might\\ndue to the fact that increasing the temperature for sampling results in many incorrect predictions. In\\ncontrast, increasing the number of hypotheses performs better due to the hypotheses selection pro-\\ncess. An iterative approach that uses the LM itself as an interpreter (i.e., SR) is also insufficient. We\\nobserve performance substantially degrades when replacing the symbolic interpreter with an LM,\\nsuggesting that the LM can excel as a hypothesis proposer but performs poorly as an interpreter.\\nWe also observe a significant discrepancy between raw accuracy and task accuracy, especially for\\nIO prompting and SC prompting. Since these evaluations directly predict output for each individual\\nexample, there is no guarantee that the LM is solving the task following the underlying rules. In fact,\\nthe mismatch between raw accuracy and task accuracy indicates some correct predictions might be\\ngenerated without using the expected computation. In contrast, rule prompting (i.e., applying the\\nLM-proposed rules) suffers less from this issue as it re-uses the same rule across all examples.\\nOOD Generalization and Interpretability.\\nIn addition to strong performance, iterative hypoth-\\nesis refinement also enables out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and improves interpretability\\nof models. For OOD evaluations, we sample longer examples from the ground-truth programs for\\nList Functions,9 and annotate examples with a larger grid for MiniARC. We evaluate performance\\non these OOD examples while fixing the seen examples. We show the results in Figure 2. We ob-\\nserve a significant performance drop for OOD examples when using IO prompting. However, the\\ndegradation is less severe for rule prompting except task accuracy on MiniARC, suggesting the LM\\nlikely solves the task using generalizable operations. While IO prompting still achieves better raw\\naccuracy on MiniARC in OOD evaluations, the performance gap between it and rule prompting is\\nreduced. Rule prompting also allows us to examine the intermediate operations, thus improving the\\ninterpretability of models. We show examples of LM-induced rules in Table 2 and Table 12.\\n8We observe T=3, N=1 performs better than T=3, N=5 on MiniSCAN, potentially because the dataset\\nis designed to evaluate compositional generalization, and thus high accuracy over seen examples does not\\nnecessarily translate to high accuracy on unseen examples. Since iterative refinement only uses accuracy over\\nexemplars as the scoring function, it might overfit to exemplars and select hypotheses that are less generalizable.\\n9Although we can theoretically sample longer sequences for MiniSCAN, we did not consider that setup, as\\nthe limited exemplars could lead to underspecification and result in multiple plausible parses due to ambiguity.\\n5\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
