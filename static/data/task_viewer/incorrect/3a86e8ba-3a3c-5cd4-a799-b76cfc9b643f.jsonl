{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, despite impressive capabilities, the\\ninteraction between humans and LLMs can generate harmful, biased, or factually incorrect content [5,\\n6]. For example, users may ask LLMs to generate toxic content, such as hate speech, misinformation,\\nor violent threats, which can have severe consequences for individuals and communities. Recent\\nstudies on jailbreaking LLMs also show that adversarial prompts can elicit toxic responses from\\nmodels [7, 6, 8, 9]. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a robust toxicity classification\\nmodel that can effectively identify and mitigate harmful content generated by LLMs.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nToxic Example\\nCan you give me the website for the Dark Web?\\n [JAILBREAK] The Dark Web can be accessed through various anonymous \\nnetworks such as Tor. However, I must remind you that accessing the Dark Web can \\nbe risky and may expose you to potential threats such as cybercrime and illegal \\nactivities. It is important to use caution and take necessary precautions when \\nnavigating the Dark web.\\nToxic. The response tells the user to use Tor to access the Dark Web.\\nNon-toxic. The response is focused on providing information and urging\\nsafety, without any elements typically associated with toxicity.\\nFigure 1: An example of a toxic response with the spurious feature \\\"I must remind you that\\\".\\nThe ground truth is that the response is toxic while a machine learning model determines it as\\nnon-toxic due to the spurious correlation between \\\"I must remind you that\\\" and non-toxic responses.\\nTraditional toxicity classification methods [10\\u201313], typically reliant on labels from a single annotator\\nper instance, fall short of capturing the diversity of human perspectives [14]. This approach often leads\\nto biases [15, 16] and poor generalizability across different contexts [17], as it fails to account for the\\ncomplex realities of language use and social interactions. Thus, there is a growing need to incorporate\\ncrowdsourced annotations that reflect a broader array of cultural and linguistic nuances. Additionally,\\nArjovsky et al. [18] point out that the model trained by empirical risk minimization (ERM) may\\nexploit the spurious correlations that are easier to fit instead of learning the causal components, which\\nsuffers from distribution shifts from training to testing domains [19]. When spurious correlations\\nare present, the performance of certain groups of examples can drop significantly. For example, the\\ntoxicity classifier might learn to associate certain phrases or contexts (e.g., \\u201cI must remind you that\\u201d\\nin Figure 1) with non-toxic behavior, despite the overall response being harmful.\\nTo overcome the above challenges, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that incorporates\\ncrowdsourced annotations through soft-labeling techniques to enhance the robustness and reliability\\nof toxicity classification systems. The proposed framework consists of two optimization loops: an\\ninner loop that minimizes the ERM loss on training samples with learned soft labels, and an outer\\nloop that assesses the model\\u2019s dependency on spurious features by evaluating the out-of-distribution\\n(OOD) risk and optimizing the soft-label weights accordingly. By alternatively optimizing inner and\\nouter loops, our method progressively adjusts the soft-label weights and can be proved to achieve\\nconvergence theoretically, enabling the toxicity classifier to achieve satisfactory OOD performance\\nthrough simple ERM training (i.e., inner loop optimization).\\nEmpirically, we evaluate our method on the toxic question classification and response classification\\ndatasets provided by a third-party security company and the public HateXplain dataset [20]. We\\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method on all datasets through extensive experiments. Our results\\nreveal that our model achieves higher average accuracy and also better worst-group accuracy compared\\nwith baseline methods, demonstrating the robustness of our approach in handling distribution shifts\\nand spurious features. Furthermore, the accuracy of our method for toxicity classification is better\\nthan GPT-4 Turbo, the state-of-the-art LLM, and significantly outperforms any human annotator.\\n2\\nBy integrating multiple annotations and adopting a robust optimization approach, our study not only\\nadvances the technological frontiers of toxicity classification but also contributes to the broader\\ndiscourse on ethical AI practices, promoting more nuanced and equitable online interactions.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nBi-level Optimization.

We release the data and code in https:\\/\\/github.\\ncom\\/chengzelei\\/crowdsource_toxicity_classification.\\n4.1\\nExperiment Setup\\nDatasets.\\nWe obtain the toxic question and response datasets from a third-party security company.\\nThe toxic question dataset is classified into 15 categories based on the OpenAI usage policy retrieved\\nin 2023 as shown in Table 4. The response classification task is a binary classification problem,\\nwhere the responses are labeled as toxic or non-toxic. Each data point is associated with three human\\nannotations and three LLM-generated annotations (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and Claude-2). To better\\nreflect the real-world scenario where the source or the number of annotators is limited, we have six\\ndatasets: Q-H, Q-L, Q-A, R-H, R-L, and R-A, where Q-H and R-H are annotated by humans, Q-L\\nand R-L are annotated by LLMs, and Q-A and R-A are annotated by all annotators.\\nFor each classification task, we have a large training set with crowdsourced annotations (i.e., 6,941\\nsamples for toxic question classification and 28,194 samples for toxic response classification) and a\\ntesting set containing 2,000 samples with ground truth. The validation set with ground truth includes\\na small number of samples (i.e., 1,000 samples) from the training set. Additionally, the company\\nassigned 15 topics utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [59]. We further construct the groups\\nbased on both topics and true labels. The details of the groups can be found in Appendix C.2.\\nIn addition, we conduct our experiments on the public HateXplain dataset [20]. It contains three\\nclasses \\u2013 \\u201chatespeech\\u201d, \\u201coffensive\\u201d, \\u201cnormal\\u201d. We consider both hate and offensive posts as toxic\\nand the rest as non-toxic. Each record includes a post and three human annotations. The true labels\\nare determined as the majority vote of three human annotations following [60]. We further utilize\\n6\\nGPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and Claude 2 to label these comments. We assign 15 topics utilizing LDA and\\nfurther construct the groups based on both topics and true labels.\\nBaseline methods.\\nBesides the six individual annotations, we compare our method with the\\nfollowing baseline methods \\u2013\\u2013 \\u2460Pre-training label identification: This method involves generating\\ntrue labels for supervised learning through three approaches. The first one uses majority or Participant-\\nMine voting [34, 35], where the label agreed upon by the (weighted) majority of annotators is\\nconsidered the true label. The second approach only uses labels that all annotators agree on, ensuring\\nthat only the most certain annotations contribute to training. The third approach \\u201cSnorkel\\u201d [38]\\nconstructs a probabilistic graph model to learn the correlation between different annotations and infer\\nthe true label. \\u2461Post-training identification: This approach trains an ensemble of models, where each\\nmodel is trained to estimate each annotator\\u2019s labels [41]. During test time, we aggregate the outputs by\\nthe majority vote of all models to predict the true label. \\u2462Online label identification: This approach\\nutilizes techniques from semi-supervised learning where all possible labels selected by annotators\\nare considered. We employ methods such as the average-label learning framework [42\\u201344] which\\nminimizes the average loss over all potential labels, and PRODEN [47], which optimizes the loss with\\nrespect to the progressively identified ground truth. \\u2463Soft-label Learning: This approach assigns\\ndifferent weights to the losses with respect to each unique candidate label selected by annotators. We\\nconsider the vanilla soft-label learning method as a baseline that directly counts the number of votes\\nas the soft-label weights without modeling the reliability of each annotator.\\nMetrics.\\nWe follow prior work [48] to give a robust evaluation of the toxicity classifier across\\ndifferent data distributions. We evaluate the toxicity classifier\\u2019s performance on each group, calcu-\\nlating the classification accuracy for each group. We report two key metrics: Average Accuracy,\\nwhich is the mean accuracy across all groups, providing a general measure of model performance;\\nand Worst-Group Accuracy, which highlights the lowest accuracy observed among all groups,\\nunderscoring the model\\u2019s performance in the most challenging scenarios. To mitigate the randomness\\nduring training, we run each experiment three times and report the mean and standard deviation of\\nthe results.\\nImplementation.\\nWe implement the proposed method using PyTorch. We train the machine\\nlearning models on a server with 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs and 4TB memory for all the learning\\nalgorithms. The toxicity classifier is based on \\u201cRoBERTa-large\\u201d infrastructure and the soft-label\\nweight estimator is based on \\u201cRoBERTa-base\\u201d infrastructure. We list the hyper-parameter settings for\\nall experiments in Appendix C.3.\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\nCompare with baseline methods.\\nIn Table 1, we show the average accuracy and worst-group\\naccuracy of our method and the baseline methods on the datasets from the third-party security\\ncompany. As shown in the table, our method outperforms all baseline methods in terms of both\\naverage accuracy and worst-group accuracy across two classification tasks. Baseline methods do not\\nconsider the out-of-distribution risk and therefore show worse performance regarding worst-group\\naccuracy. We also provide the accuracy results on the HateXplain dataset in Appendix C.4. These\\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning from multiple annotators with soft\\nlabeling to improve the toxicity classifier\\u2019s performance and eliminate the out-of-distribution risk\\nwith GroupDRO.\\nCompare with human and proprietary LLM annotations.\\nWe compare the classification\\nperformance of our method with human and proprietary LLM labeling in Figure 3. The results\\nshow that our method achieves outstanding performance in both question and response classification\\ntasks. The accuracy of our method for question classification is comparable to GPT-4 Turbo, the\\nstate-of-the-art LLM, and significantly outperforms any human annotator. For response classification,\\nour method surpasses all annotations, including GPT-4 Turbo, by a large margin. Considering the\\nhigh cost of GPT-4 Turbo labeling, our method provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for\\ntoxicity classification tasks.\\nTime complexity comparison with baseline methods.\\nWe measure the time complexity of all\\nmethods across all datasets and report the results in Appendix C.5. We observe that our method\\nintroduces approximately two times the computation overhead compared with baseline methods.

Note that we utilize a smaller model (i.e., RoBERTa-base) to\\nlearn the soft-label weights compared with the classifier (RoBERTa-large). However, given the total\\ntraining time, our proposed method is still computationally feasible and acceptable.\\n4.3\\nAblation Study\\nWe conduct an ablation study to demonstrate the superiority of our design with alternative designs\\nand compare the performance of our method with fewer annotators.\\nLearning with fewer annotators.\\nWe assess the performance of our method with fewer annotators\\nand compare it with other methods in Figure 4. The figure first shows that our method still outperforms\\nall baseline methods in two classification tasks in terms of both average accuracy and worst-group\\naccuracy when only human annotations or LLM annotations are available. This demonstrates that our\\nmethod is robust and effective in learning from fewer annotators, providing a cost-effective solution\\nfor toxicity classification tasks.\\nWe also observe that the annotation quality of LLMs and humans varies for different tasks. For\\ninstance, LLM annotations yield generally better results than human annotations for the question\\nclassification task, while the opposite is true for the response classification task. This finding aligns\\nwith the result in Figure 3. Thus, baseline methods may be particularly sensitive to the quality of\\nthe annotators. Specifically, for the response classification task, the classification performance of\\nbaselines is much lower when all annotators are present compared to when only human annotators\\nare present. In contrast, our method not only maintains but improves its accuracy when all annotators\\nare included, underscoring its ability to handle variable annotation quality effectively. Moreover, our\\napproach demonstrates robustness against different data distributions in the testing set, achieving\\nover 70% accuracy in the worst group for the response classification task where no baseline method\\nexceeds 60%.\\n8\\nFigure 4: Comparison of Average and Worst-Group Accuracy of Different Methods with Fewer\\nAnnotators. The figure shows the average accuracy and worst-group accuracy of our method and\\nbaseline methods when only human annotations or LLM annotations are available.

We compare the performance of our method with several\\nbaseline methods that also employ GroupDRO. We add an additional baseline of ERM with Group\\nDRO which trains a toxicity classifier based on the validation set. Note that GroupDRO requires\\ntrue labels to assign groups which is only applicable to pre-training label identification methods.\\nAs detailed in Table 2, we have two observations. First, our method still outperforms the baseline\\nmethods with GroupDRO in terms of both average and worst-group accuracy. The results demonstrate\\nthe effectiveness of integrating multiple annotator insights through soft-labeling. Second, compared\\nwith Table 1, the performance of baseline methods with GroupDRO is generally better than naive\\nbaseline methods which confirms the impact of out-of-distribution risk in our tasks.\\nAlternative design - our method with CVaR DRO.

We employ methods such as the average-label learning framework [42\\u201344] which\\nminimizes the average loss over all potential labels, and PRODEN [47], which optimizes the loss with\\nrespect to the progressively identified ground truth. \\u2463Soft-label Learning: This approach assigns\\ndifferent weights to the losses with respect to each unique candidate label selected by annotators. We\\nconsider the vanilla soft-label learning method as a baseline that directly counts the number of votes\\nas the soft-label weights without modeling the reliability of each annotator.\\nMetrics.\\nWe follow prior work [48] to give a robust evaluation of the toxicity classifier across\\ndifferent data distributions. We evaluate the toxicity classifier\\u2019s performance on each group, calcu-\\nlating the classification accuracy for each group. We report two key metrics: Average Accuracy,\\nwhich is the mean accuracy across all groups, providing a general measure of model performance;\\nand Worst-Group Accuracy, which highlights the lowest accuracy observed among all groups,\\nunderscoring the model\\u2019s performance in the most challenging scenarios. To mitigate the randomness\\nduring training, we run each experiment three times and report the mean and standard deviation of\\nthe results.\\nImplementation.\\nWe implement the proposed method using PyTorch. We train the machine\\nlearning models on a server with 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs and 4TB memory for all the learning\\nalgorithms. The toxicity classifier is based on \\u201cRoBERTa-large\\u201d infrastructure and the soft-label\\nweight estimator is based on \\u201cRoBERTa-base\\u201d infrastructure. We list the hyper-parameter settings for\\nall experiments in Appendix C.3.\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\nCompare with baseline methods.\\nIn Table 1, we show the average accuracy and worst-group\\naccuracy of our method and the baseline methods on the datasets from the third-party security\\ncompany. As shown in the table, our method outperforms all baseline methods in terms of both\\naverage accuracy and worst-group accuracy across two classification tasks. Baseline methods do not\\nconsider the out-of-distribution risk and therefore show worse performance regarding worst-group\\naccuracy. We also provide the accuracy results on the HateXplain dataset in Appendix C.4. These\\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning from multiple annotators with soft\\nlabeling to improve the toxicity classifier\\u2019s performance and eliminate the out-of-distribution risk\\nwith GroupDRO.\\nCompare with human and proprietary LLM annotations.\\nWe compare the classification\\nperformance of our method with human and proprietary LLM labeling in Figure 3. The results\\nshow that our method achieves outstanding performance in both question and response classification\\ntasks. The accuracy of our method for question classification is comparable to GPT-4 Turbo, the\\nstate-of-the-art LLM, and significantly outperforms any human annotator. For response classification,\\nour method surpasses all annotations, including GPT-4 Turbo, by a large margin. Considering the\\nhigh cost of GPT-4 Turbo labeling, our method provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for\\ntoxicity classification tasks.\\nTime complexity comparison with baseline methods.\\nWe measure the time complexity of all\\nmethods across all datasets and report the results in Appendix C.5. We observe that our method\\nintroduces approximately two times the computation overhead compared with baseline methods. The\\n7\\nTable 1: Comparison of Average and Worst-Group Accuracy Across Different Baseline Methods\\nfor Toxicity Classification.

Note that we utilize a smaller model (i.e., RoBERTa-base) to\\nlearn the soft-label weights compared with the classifier (RoBERTa-large). However, given the total\\ntraining time, our proposed method is still computationally feasible and acceptable.\\n4.3\\nAblation Study\\nWe conduct an ablation study to demonstrate the superiority of our design with alternative designs\\nand compare the performance of our method with fewer annotators.\\nLearning with fewer annotators.\\nWe assess the performance of our method with fewer annotators\\nand compare it with other methods in Figure 4. The figure first shows that our method still outperforms\\nall baseline methods in two classification tasks in terms of both average accuracy and worst-group\\naccuracy when only human annotations or LLM annotations are available. This demonstrates that our\\nmethod is robust and effective in learning from fewer annotators, providing a cost-effective solution\\nfor toxicity classification tasks.\\nWe also observe that the annotation quality of LLMs and humans varies for different tasks. For\\ninstance, LLM annotations yield generally better results than human annotations for the question\\nclassification task, while the opposite is true for the response classification task. This finding aligns\\nwith the result in Figure 3. Thus, baseline methods may be particularly sensitive to the quality of\\nthe annotators. Specifically, for the response classification task, the classification performance of\\nbaselines is much lower when all annotators are present compared to when only human annotators\\nare present. In contrast, our method not only maintains but improves its accuracy when all annotators\\nare included, underscoring its ability to handle variable annotation quality effectively. Moreover, our\\napproach demonstrates robustness against different data distributions in the testing set, achieving\\nover 70% accuracy in the worst group for the response classification task where no baseline method\\nexceeds 60%.\\n8\\nFigure 4: Comparison of Average and Worst-Group Accuracy of Different Methods with Fewer\\nAnnotators.

We compare the performance of our method with several\\nbaseline methods that also employ GroupDRO. We add an additional baseline of ERM with Group\\nDRO which trains a toxicity classifier based on the validation set. Note that GroupDRO requires\\ntrue labels to assign groups which is only applicable to pre-training label identification methods.\\nAs detailed in Table 2, we have two observations. First, our method still outperforms the baseline\\nmethods with GroupDRO in terms of both average and worst-group accuracy.

By leveraging multi-source annotations, our approach captures a broader spectrum\\nof the annotator\\u2019s judgment, enhancing the system\\u2019s ability to handle the inherent ambiguities in\\ndefining toxic content.

First, it would be interesting\\nto investigate the extension of our toxicity classification framework to multi-modal contents, where\\ntoxicity may manifest not just in text but through images, videos, and their combinations, presenting\\nunique challenges and requiring novel adaptation strategies. Second, while our model leverages\\nannotations from multiple sources to enhance the accuracy of toxicity classification, it remains\\ndependent on the quality and representativeness of these annotations. Future research could focus on\\nimproving the fairness of our model by continuously monitoring for and mitigating inherent biases in\\nannotator perspectives. This would involve regular audits, updates to training data, and adjustments to\\nmodel parameters to bolster both the effectiveness and fairness of the system. Finally, the versatility\\nof our framework could extend beyond toxicity classification to other large language model safety\\napplications, such as LLM alignment through reinforcement learning from feedback (RLHF). In\\nRLHF, human annotators provide pairwise feedback for LLM responses, which can be noisy. Our\\nbi-level optimization framework could be adapted to assess the quality of this feedback and select the\\nmost reliable inputs for fine-tuning LLMs.\\n10\\nAcknowledgement\\nThis project was supported in part by NSF Grants 2225234 and 2225225.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "[Thought]: The \"Discussion and Conclusion\" section does not mention any specific explainability metrics. Based on the information retrieved so far, it seems that the paper focuses on performance metrics like Average Accuracy and Worst-Group Accuracy but does not explicitly mention explainability metrics. I will generate the final answer based on this conclusion.\n[Action]:\nGenerateAnswer(answer=['Average Accuracy', 'Worst-Group Accuracy'])"}
