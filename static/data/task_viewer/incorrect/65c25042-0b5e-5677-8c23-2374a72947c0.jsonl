{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

To address this, pioneering approaches [23, 11, 37, 3]\\nhave proposed paired datasets, consisting of blurry images and their corresponding sharp images,\\ndesigned for training deep neural networks. Specifically, their efforts to create deblurring datasets\\nhave primarily relied on two methods: synthetic [23, 22, 46] and real [47, 30, 29] data generation.\\nHowever, both approaches heavily depend on heuristic human capture techniques, often leading\\nto limitations such as incomplete coverage of large-scale datasets and inadequate representation of\\ndiverse blur types (i.e., blur length and directions).\\nSince capturing blurry and sharp images simultaneously with a single sensor is challenging, earlier\\nmethods [35, 22, 33, 14] have resorted to synthetically generating blurry images from consecutive\\nsharp frames. They achieve this by capturing consecutive sharp frames using high-speed cameras and\\nthen aggregating these neighboring frames to create synthetic blurry images. Although this allows for\\neasy generation of blurry images, the resulting blur is derived from highly discrete frames, which\\nleads to differences from real-world blur and fails to generalize well to real-world blurry images.\\nLater methods [47, 30, 29] have introduced specialized camera systems equipped with beam-splitters.\\nThese systems divide the light entering the camera lens into two image sensors with varying exposure\\ntimes, producing sharp images from the shorter and blurry images from the longer-exposed sensor.\\nWhile they generate a more realistic blur, making it better suited for real-world applications, they\\npresent several challenges. First, they require precise camera system design, complicating the use of\\nThe dataset is available at: https:\\/\\/github.com\\/dongwoohhh\\/GS-Blur\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nFigure 1: Examples of the proposed GS-Blur dataset.

Indeed, [47] and [30] obtained their datasets from a single camera model, the\\nSony A7R3 and machine vision camera, respectively. Second, despite the use of different exposure\\ntimes for the two sensors, one capturing blurry images and the other sharp images, discrepancies\\nin image signal processing (ISP) can arise, requiring additional image processing such as white\\nbalancing and color mapping. Moreover, the datasets heavily rely on human capture, which limits\\ntheir scale and results in restricted blur trajectories in terms of blur length and direction.\\nIn this paper, we explore methods to synthesize realistic blurry images to improve deblurring quality\\nfor real-world blurry images generally. To this end, we present a novel dataset, GS-Blur, which\\nsynthesizes blurry images using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [9]. Specifically, we utilize the\\nexisting large-scale multi-view dataset, MVImgNet [43], to train 3DGS on sharp multi-view images,\\nenabling the reconstruction of 3D scenes. Then, from these reconstructed scenes, we use two\\ncamera views to render images: one from a fixed position and one from a moving position along\\nrandomly generated motion trajectories, corresponding to sharp and blurry images, respectively.\\nSpecifically, following the method in [23, 22, 46], we aggregate multiple images from cameras\\nalong the trajectory to create blurry images, but unlike [23, 22, 46]\\u2019s use of highly discrete frames,\\nwe employ denser frames by positioning multiple cameras along the trajectories, resulting in more\\nrealistic blur. Moreover, by utilizing various degrees for the blur trajectories, our GS-Blur dataset\\nincludes diverse blur trajectories in terms of both blur length and direction. By using MVImgNet,\\nwhich consists of large-scale multi-view images from diverse camera models, our GS-Blur provides\\ndiverse deblurring image pairs with significant advantages, showing generalizability, as detailed in\\nthe experiments Section 4.3. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to justify the\\nreconstruction of our GS-Blur dataset in Section 4.4.

As blur commonly occurs in various situations [31, 24, 25, 28], early\\ndeblurring methods [11, 23, 26, 27, 3, 45, 15] modeled a blurry image as a convolution of a 2D\\nblur kernel with a latent sharp image, optimizing the sharp image for a known blur kernel using\\n2\\nTable 1: Comparison of existing datasets with our\\nnew GS-Blur dataset.\\nDataset\\nMethod\\nScale\\nExp. time (ms)\\nResolution\\nNeed ISP\\nDVD [35]\\nSynthetic\\n6,708\\n25\\n1280 \\u00d7 720\\n\\u2717\\nGoPro [23]\\nSynthetic\\n3,214\\n25-50\\n1280 \\u00d7 720\\n\\u2717\\nREDS [22]\\nSynthetic\\n30,000\\n25-50\\n1280 \\u00d7 720\\n\\u2717\\nHIDE [33]\\nSynthetic\\n8,422\\n41.667\\n1280 \\u00d7 720\\n\\u2717\\nHFR-DVD [14]\\nSynthetic\\n13,500\\n40\\n960 \\u00d7 540\\n\\u2717\\nBSD [47]\\nReal\\n33,000\\n1-24\\n640 \\u00d7 480\\n\\u2713\\nRealBlur [30]\\nReal\\n4,738\\n500\\n680 \\u00d7 772\\n\\u2713\\nRSBlur [29]\\nReal+Synthetic\\n13,358\\n100\\n1920 \\u00d7 1200\\n\\u2713\\nGS-Blur\\nSynthetic\\n156,209\\nVarious\\nVarious\\n\\u2717\\nREDS\\nRSBlur\\n(a) Real vs Synthetic\\nGS-Blur\\nRSBlur\\n(b) Real vs GS-Blur\\nFigure 2: Motion distribution visualization\\nof synthetic, real, and GS-Blur datasets.\\nRichardson-Lucy deconvolution. However, these methods struggled with real-world scenarios where\\nblur kernels are unknown. Later, deep learning shifted the field to learning-based approaches, with\\nmodels like DeblurGAN [11] and DeepDeblur [23] restoring sharp images without blur kernel\\nestimation. Advanced models such as NAFNet [3] and Restormer [45] use channel attention modules,\\nwhile SwinIR [15] introduce Vision Transformer [5, 18] architectures. Despite architectural advances,\\nthese methods are data-driven, requiring extensive training data that aligns well with real-world blur\\nfor effective generalization.\\nDeblurring datasets. Table 1 shows the overview of deblurring datasets. Earlier, several synthetic\\ndatasets [35, 23, 22, 33, 14, 46] using high-speed cameras have been proposed to train learning-based\\ndeblurring methods. DVD [35], GoPro [23], and REDS [22] create blurry images by averaging\\nconsecutive sharp frames to simulate motion blur. Similarly, HIDE [33] synthesizes blur with densely\\nannotated foreground human bounding boxes, and HFR-DVD[14] uses a higher-speed camera (e.g.,\\nSONY DSC-RX10 IV) to capture video frames, resulting in more realistic blurs. However, even with\\nhigh-speed cameras, the time interval between frames is too discrete to accurately capture continuous\\nreal-world blur patterns, resulting in less effective generalization to real-world blurry images.\\nOther approaches [47, 30, 29] use beam splitter camera systems to capture paired images, addressing\\nsynthetic dataset limitations. These systems capture blurry images with longer exposure and sharp\\nimages with shorter exposure, accurately mimicking real-world blur. However, they face several\\nchallenges. First, they require the precise design of the camera system, which is a labor-intensive task.\\nMoreover, due to the need for a sophisticated system, these datasets are restricted to specific camera\\nmodels, showing less generalizability to blurry images captured by different cameras. Despite the\\nimplementation of the specialized camera system, utilizing different exposure times for the two image\\nsensors, where one captures blurry images and the other sharp images, can lead to discrepancies in\\ndifferent light intensities reaching each sensor. This difference requires processing the images with\\ndifferent ISO settings, leading to disparities in tone or color between the blurry and sharp images. As\\na result, additional ISP processing is required to match them. Furthermore, their motion trajectories\\nhighly rely on humans, failing to capture the diverse blur patterns found in real-world scenarios.\\nIn contrast, our GS-Blur, though synthetically derived, offers greater scale, diverse exposure times,\\nand various resolutions compared to previous datasets, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the motion\\ntrajectories in GS-Blur are randomly generated in 3D space, effectively encompassing potential real-\\nworld motion trajectories. Figure 2 compares the motion trajectory distributions of synthetic [22] and\\nreal deblurring datasets [29] with our GS-Blur dataset. Here, each point in the figure represents the\\nt-SNE [39] projection of a motion trajectory, computed using the optical flow [38] from the provided\\nconsecutive sharp frames. As shown in Figure 2a, the distribution of the synthetic dataset (\\u25cf) does\\nnot overlap with the distribution of the real dataset (\\u25cf), indicating that the previous synthetic dataset\\nfails to cover the motion diversity of real-world images. On the other hand, Figure 2b shows that the\\ndistribution of GS-Blur (\\u25cf) overlaps with the real distribution, demonstrating that GS-Blur covers\\nmost real blurry images\\u2019 distributions and exhibits a wider range of blur diversity.\\nNovel view synthesis. Unlike previous synthetic datasets that simulate blur by aggregating images,\\nour approach recovers 3D scenes and moves the view within these 3D spaces to mimic camera\\nshakes with varying trajectories, making our work closely related to novel view synthesis. Earlier,\\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [20] made significant strides in 3D vision tasks, particularly in photo-\\nrealistic novel view synthesis. Despite the potential of NeRF\\u2019s implicit neural representation (INR)\\nto become a widely used 3D representation, NeRF-based methods [36, 6, 1, 21] face challenges in\\nachieving real-time novel view synthesis without compromising visual quality.

As a result, the generated sharp images may contain floating point artifacts that do not\\naccurately represent clean images. To address this, we have measured the PSNR between the ground\\ntruth and rendered sharp images for each 3D-reconstructed scene, removing scenes that fall below\\na certain PSNR threshold. Specifically, if any view showed a PSNR drop of more than 3dB from\\nthe mean, the entire scene was classified as failed and excluded from the dataset. This method\\nensures that only high-quality scenes are included, reducing the impact of floating point-induced\\nblurring in the GS-Blur dataset. Finally, we evaluated our dataset by measuring PSNR and SSIM from\\nmulti-view images captured by camera angles not used in 3DGS training, resulting in PSNR=36.73\\nand SSIM=0.957, confirming the reliability of our sharp frames.\\n4.3\\nGeneralization of blurry frames\\nCross-validation with previous deblurring datasets.

This section\\nvalidates the effectiveness of each component by evaluating the deblurring network [3] trained on our\\nGS-Blur with various modifications on previous benchmark datasets [23, 22, 47, 29]. The overall\\nresults are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Specifically, when comparing the last row of Table 4 with the\\nother rows, our PSNR thresholding strategy clearly improves deblurring performance, demonstrating\\nthe effectiveness of the components used to reconstruct GS-Blur. Similarly, when comparing the first\\nand last rows of Table 5, our strategy of using four components significantly improves deblurring\\nperformance, showing the efficacy of the used components to reconstruct GS-Blur. In the following\\nsections, we illustrate the effectiveness of each component by individually removing them from our\\nfinal GS-Blur.\\nPSNR thresholding. As described in Section 4.2, we construct our GS-Blur dataset by excluding 3D\\nscenes with significant drops in PSNR. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this PSNR thresholding\\nstrategy, Table 4 compares results for GS-Blur with and without employing PSNR thresholding.\\nWhen the deblurring network [3] is trained solely on the dataset from failed scenes (the first row of\\nTable 4), there is a clear decline in deblurring performance, indicating that scenes with inaccurate\\n3D reconstruction (e.g., floating point artifacts) hinder training. In contrast, training on our filtered\\ndataset (the third row of Table 4), which excludes scenes that fall below the PSNR threshold,\\nconsistently outperforms the unfiltered dataset (the second row of Table 4), even with fewer scenes.\\nThis confirms the effectiveness of our filtering approach.\\n1-to-n blur generation. Unlike previous datasets [23, 22, 47, 29], which provide only single blurry\\nimage per sharp image and may lead to overfitting, GS-Blur can generate multiple (n) blurry images\\nfrom a single sharp image by varying the motion trajectories (see Figure 4 (left)). As shown in the\\nsecond row of Table 5, the performance drops consistently without 1-to-n blur generation, as our\\nfinal approach better aligns with real-world scenarios where diverse blurs can originate from a single\\nsharp image.\\nRigid-body object motion. In real-world images, blur is caused not only by camera shake but also\\nby moving objects, resulting in varying motion trajectories across different image pixels. To replicate\\nthis scenario, we incorporate rigid-body object motion into the GS-Blur dataset by applying distinct\\nmotion trajectories Tobj for objects and Tbg for the background, effectively simulating situations\\nlike a moving car captured from a stationary camera (see Figure 4 (right)). Compared to the third row\\n9\\nof Table 5, our approach in the last row, which incorporates rigid-body object motion, consistently\\nenhances performance across various benchmark datasets.\\nNoise addition. Real-world images often contain noise, and adding noise to blurry images can make\\nthem more representative of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance. Specifically, as\\nboth synthetic datasets (GoPro [23]) and real datasets (BSD [47] and RSBlur [29]) include noise in\\ntheir testing sets, training the deblurring network on our noise-added GS-Blur dataset results in mostly\\nbetter performance, as compared in the fourth and the last rows of Table 5. However, REDS [22]\\nsuppresses noise in its evaluation set by downscaling the images by 2\\n3, leading to worse performance\\nwhen the network is trained on the noise-added GS-Blur. Nevertheless, since blurry images from real\\ndatasets [47, 29] often contain noise, the addition of noise significantly enhances performance on\\nthose datasets.\\nMulti-resolution. When comparing the fifth and last rows of Table 5, which represent the performance\\nwith fixed- and multiple-resolution images in the GS-Blur dataset reconstruction, there is consistent\\nimprovement in overall performance with multiple-resolution images. This improvement can be\\nattributed to the characteristics of the MVImgNet dataset [43], which mainly contains objects close\\nto the camera. By incorporating multiple resolutions, our approach effectively simulates various\\ndistances between the camera and objects, resulting in more realistic images and consistently better\\nperformance across the evaluated metrics.\\n5\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

This section\\nvalidates the effectiveness of each component by evaluating the deblurring network [3] trained on our\\nGS-Blur with various modifications on previous benchmark datasets [23, 22, 47, 29]. The overall\\nresults are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Specifically, when comparing the last row of Table 4 with the\\nother rows, our PSNR thresholding strategy clearly improves deblurring performance, demonstrating\\nthe effectiveness of the components used to reconstruct GS-Blur. Similarly, when comparing the first\\nand last rows of Table 5, our strategy of using four components significantly improves deblurring\\nperformance, showing the efficacy of the used components to reconstruct GS-Blur. In the following\\nsections, we illustrate the effectiveness of each component by individually removing them from our\\nfinal GS-Blur.\\nPSNR thresholding. As described in Section 4.2, we construct our GS-Blur dataset by excluding 3D\\nscenes with significant drops in PSNR. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this PSNR thresholding\\nstrategy, Table 4 compares results for GS-Blur with and without employing PSNR thresholding.\\nWhen the deblurring network [3] is trained solely on the dataset from failed scenes (the first row of\\nTable 4), there is a clear decline in deblurring performance, indicating that scenes with inaccurate\\n3D reconstruction (e.g., floating point artifacts) hinder training. In contrast, training on our filtered\\ndataset (the third row of Table 4), which excludes scenes that fall below the PSNR threshold,\\nconsistently outperforms the unfiltered dataset (the second row of Table 4), even with fewer scenes.\\nThis confirms the effectiveness of our filtering approach.\\n1-to-n blur generation. Unlike previous datasets [23, 22, 47, 29], which provide only single blurry\\nimage per sharp image and may lead to overfitting, GS-Blur can generate multiple (n) blurry images\\nfrom a single sharp image by varying the motion trajectories (see Figure 4 (left)). As shown in the\\nsecond row of Table 5, the performance drops consistently without 1-to-n blur generation, as our\\nfinal approach better aligns with real-world scenarios where diverse blurs can originate from a single\\nsharp image.\\nRigid-body object motion. In real-world images, blur is caused not only by camera shake but also\\nby moving objects, resulting in varying motion trajectories across different image pixels. To replicate\\nthis scenario, we incorporate rigid-body object motion into the GS-Blur dataset by applying distinct\\nmotion trajectories Tobj for objects and Tbg for the background, effectively simulating situations\\nlike a moving car captured from a stationary camera (see Figure 4 (right)). Compared to the third row\\n9\\nof Table 5, our approach in the last row, which incorporates rigid-body object motion, consistently\\nenhances performance across various benchmark datasets.\\nNoise addition. Real-world images often contain noise, and adding noise to blurry images can make\\nthem more representative of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance. Specifically, as\\nboth synthetic datasets (GoPro [23]) and real datasets (BSD [47] and RSBlur [29]) include noise in\\ntheir testing sets, training the deblurring network on our noise-added GS-Blur dataset results in mostly\\nbetter performance, as compared in the fourth and the last rows of Table 5. However, REDS [22]\\nsuppresses noise in its evaluation set by downscaling the images by 2\\n3, leading to worse performance\\nwhen the network is trained on the noise-added GS-Blur. Nevertheless, since blurry images from real\\ndatasets [47, 29] often contain noise, the addition of noise significantly enhances performance on\\nthose datasets.\\nMulti-resolution. When comparing the fifth and last rows of Table 5, which represent the performance\\nwith fixed- and multiple-resolution images in the GS-Blur dataset reconstruction, there is consistent\\nimprovement in overall performance with multiple-resolution images. This improvement can be\\nattributed to the characteristics of the MVImgNet dataset [43], which mainly contains objects close\\nto the camera. By incorporating multiple resolutions, our approach effectively simulates various\\ndistances between the camera and objects, resulting in more realistic images and consistently better\\nperformance across the evaluated metrics.\\n5\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
