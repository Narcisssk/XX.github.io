{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of the distinctive fea-\\ntures that set our work apart from the most closely related benchmarks in the field.\\nRLBench (James et al., 2020) and ManiSkill2 (Mu et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2023) are two recent\\nlarge-scale benchmarks for robot learning with a large variety of tasks with both, proprioceptive\\nand visual data. However, the demonstrations are generated through motion planning and are hence\\nlacking diversity. Meta-World is another robot learning benchmark with 50 different tasks and a\\nfocus on multi-task reinforcement learning (Yu et al., 2020). Yet, no human demonstrations exists\\nfor these tasks and most tasks typically only have one solution. D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) proposed\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nstandardized environments and datasets for offline reinforcement learning with various tasks.

A benchmark with a focus on human\\ndemonstrations is Robomimic (Mandlekar et al., 2021), featuring 8 different task in simulation and\\nreal world environments. The demonstrations, collected by multiple people with various degrees of\\nexpertise using the RoboTurk framework (Mandlekar et al., 2018). Yet, the tasks where not designed\\nto show diverse behavior and consequently, non of the tested algorithms was designed to capture the\\ndiversity of the behavior.\\nThe benchmarks most closely related to D3IL are Block-Push (Florence et al., 2022; Shafiullah\\net al., 2022), T-Shape Pushing (Florence et al., 2022) and Relay Kitchen Gupta et al. (2019). While\\nBlock-Push has 4 different modalities, the behavior is generated by a scripted policy and is hence\\nlacking variance and fall-back solutions in the dataset. T-Shape tasks are limited to a maximum of\\ntwo modalities. The Relay Kitchen environment (Gupta et al., 2019) contains 7 different tasks with\\nhuman demonstrations that solve four tasks in sequence but does not require closed-loop sensory\\nfeedback. Further, several recent work have shown to achieve nearly optimal performance (Chi\\net al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) on these benchmarks, limiting further progress in these environments.\\nMoreover, none of the mentioned benchmarks offer metrics to evaluate the diversity of the learned\\nbehavior.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nEnd-to-End Driving.

Recently, researchers have started to use deep learning methods as an alternation, including\\ntandem network [14, 15], Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) [16], Generative Adversarial Network\\n[17] and Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) [13]. After training on a large dataset, these\\nmodels can learn the inverse mapping from optical responses to structure space and finish designs\\nwithin one second, which is much faster than optimization methods. Notably, the complexity of\\nthese deep learning models requires large amounts of training data, which are usually synthetic data\\nprepared through simulation methods like the Transfer Matrix Method [7]. Most of these methods\\nadopt a similar random sampling policy and suffer from OOD issues. However, how to deal with the\\nOOD problem has not been extensively explored in this domain.\\n2.2\\nOut-of-Distribution Problem\\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in many traditional deep learning tasks refers to the phenomenon\\nthat the training set has a significant distribution shift with the test data, leading to poor generalization\\nperformance [18, 19]. A promising solution method to the problem is Transfer Learning, which has\\nbeen investigated in both CV and NLP fields [20, 21, 22, 23]. The most related work in the field of\\nnanophotonics problems is Ref. [24, 25], which solves the OOD problems in forward simulation by\\ngenerating new training data iteratively [24] to enable the model to predict two-dimension photonic\\nattributes (material stiffness and strength level). However, our problem considered here is much\\nmore complicated and difficult since we are considering the inverse problem with high dimensional\\nout-of-distribution data.\\n3\\nMethods\\n3.1\\nProblem Definition\\nIn the scientific domain, considering the causal factors x \\u2208X and the observed physical outcome\\ny \\u2208Y, there are two major problems to be solved: the forward simulation of X \\u2192Y, and the inverse\\ndesign of Y \\u2192X. The forward simulation is definite and can be obtained by solving the mathematical\\nequations involved inside the physical system. However, the inverse design is nontrivial because there\\nis no such equation that describes the inverse relationship. In addition, the one-to-many mapping\\nissue, meaning multiple different x can lead to similar y, also complicates this problem.\\nFor multilayer structures, the causal factors x refer to the multilayer structure and include the material\\ncomposition m = [m1, m2, . . . , mN] and layer thicknesses t = [t1, t2, . . . , tN], where N denotes\\nthe number of layers. Usually, material mi is a discrete variable, and ti is a continuous variable. On\\nthe other hand, y refers to the optical responses that we hope to design, e.g., spectrum or colors,\\nand can be represented as a vector. TMM [7] can finish the forward prediction and calculate the\\nspectrum y for a given x by solving equations relating to the wave fields at the boundaries of each\\nlayer. However, TMM does not inherently support the reverse computation of deriving x from a given\\ny. In OptoGPT, the model treats the design parameters of x = {[m1, m2, . . . , mN], [t1, t2, . . . , tN]}\\nas a sequence of x = {[m1, t1], [m2, t2], . . . , [mN, tN]} and uses sequential generation to design\\nmultilayer structures layer-by-layer when given input y as a condition. In their consideration, at\\neach layer, there are 18 different types of materials and 50 different thicknesses discretized by 10nm\\nranging from 10nm to 500nm. The maximum number of layers is 20. Therefore, the size of the\\n3\\nbining genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization method to actively perturb the\\ngenerated data towards the OOD region.\\n\\u2022 We define an evaluation metric to balance the design accuracy as well as the distance away\\nfrom the original dataset region in the corresponding spectrum space. Using this metric, we\\nare able to visualize the learning effect of our model at different augmentation steps.\\n\\u2022 We demonstrate the proposed methods in the OptoGPT model and achieve much better\\nperformance in many difficult but practical photonic applications.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\n2.1\\nMultilayer Thin Film Inverse Design\\nTraditional inverse design methods for multilayer structures are usually based on heuristic optimiza-\\ntions. Recently, researchers have started to use deep learning methods as an alternation, including\\ntandem network [14, 15], Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) [16], Generative Adversarial Network\\n[17] and Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) [13]. After training on a large dataset, these\\nmodels can learn the inverse mapping from optical responses to structure space and finish designs\\nwithin one second, which is much faster than optimization methods. Notably, the complexity of\\nthese deep learning models requires large amounts of training data, which are usually synthetic data\\nprepared through simulation methods like the Transfer Matrix Method [7]. Most of these methods\\nadopt a similar random sampling policy and suffer from OOD issues. However, how to deal with the\\nOOD problem has not been extensively explored in this domain.\\n2.2\\nOut-of-Distribution Problem\\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in many traditional deep learning tasks refers to the phenomenon\\nthat the training set has a significant distribution shift with the test data, leading to poor generalization\\nperformance [18, 19]. A promising solution method to the problem is Transfer Learning, which has\\nbeen investigated in both CV and NLP fields [20, 21, 22, 23]. The most related work in the field of\\nnanophotonics problems is Ref. [24, 25], which solves the OOD problems in forward simulation by\\ngenerating new training data iteratively [24] to enable the model to predict two-dimension photonic\\nattributes (material stiffness and strength level). However, our problem considered here is much\\nmore complicated and difficult since we are considering the inverse problem with high dimensional\\nout-of-distribution data.\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Then we propose a new TM-augmented NMT on the basis of the two techniques to address the contradictory phenomenon as presented in $\\\\S1$ . Finally we empirically quantify the variance and bias for the proposed TM-augmented NMT. Note that the proposed TM-augmented NMT is general enough to be applied on top of any specifc TMaugmented NMT models.\\n4.1 Two Techniques to Reduce Variance Technique 1: Conditioning on One TM Sentence In conventional TM-augmented NMT, the translation model $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ is conditioned on $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ consisting of fve2 retrieved TMs $\\\\{{\\\\bf z}_{1},{\\\\bf z}_{2},{\\\\bf z}_{3},{\\\\bf z}_{4},{\\\\bf z}_{5}\\\\}$ with $\\\\mathbf z_{i}=(\\\\mathbf x_{i}^{\\\\mathrm{tm}},\\\\mathbf y_{i}^{\\\\mathrm{tm}})$ . Similar to the analysis in Eq.(5-6), we can obtain the following equations:\\nwhere ${\\\\bf Z}_{>1}~=~\\\\{{\\\\bf z}_{2},{\\\\bf z}_{3},{\\\\bf z}_{4},{\\\\bf z}_{5}\\\\}$ , and the second equation holds due to the conditional independence assumption in Eq. (6). In this sense, we can see that $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ conditioned on fve retrieved\\nTMs is actually an approximation of $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}_{1})$ conditioned on a single retrieved TM $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1}$ . As a result, as analysed in $\\\\S3.1$ , whether $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ is a good estimator depends on the variance with respect to $\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1}$ , i.e., $\\\\mathbb{V}_{\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1}}P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1})$ .\\nBased on the above analyses, to alleviate the variance, we directly estimate $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ by using a single sampled sentence pair. Formally, suppose $\\\\textbf{z}=\\\\mathbf{\\\\nabla}\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm{{tm}}},\\\\mathbf{y}^{\\\\mathrm{{tm}}}\\\\rangle$ is a single bilingual sentence sampled from $P(\\\\mathbf{z}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ , we adopt the following TMaugmented NMT conditioned on a single retrieved sentence $\\\\mathbf{z}$ :\\nwhere $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ can be any model architecture of TM-augmented NMT models $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf Z)$ by replacing top- $K$ TMs $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ with a single top-1 TM $\\\\mathbf{z}$ . In addition, the training of the above model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ is the same as the training of the conventional model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf Z)$ .\\nTechnique 2: Enlarging the Sample Size In Eq. (12), $\\\\mathbb{E}_{z}P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}_{<t},\\\\mathbf{z})$ is approximated by one sample $\\\\mathbf{z}$ , which still induces some potential estimation errors due to the variance $\\\\mathbb{V}_{\\\\mathbf{z}}P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}_{<t},\\\\mathbf{z})$ . In fact, the estimation errors can be further reduced by the estimation using multiple samples as follows.\\nProposition 1. If $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\cdots,\\\\mathbf{z}_{K}$ are independent and identically distributed random variables sampled from the $P(\\\\mathbf{z}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ , then the following inequality holds (The proof is presented in Appendix A.):\\nAccording to the above Proposition, we propose the method to approximate $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t})$ through the average ensemble of all $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z_{k})$ :\\nNote that we do not particularly retrain the averaged ensemble model by directly taking the parameters from the model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ trained in Technique 1 above in this paper.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We consider different configurations for BERT classifiers based on the input representations $\\\\mathbf{I_{B}},\\\\mathbf{I_{F}}$ or $\\\\mathbf{I_{B+F}}$ , and the prompts used P1, P2, P3 or $\\\\bf P1+P2$ described in Section 4.1.1.\\nWe also consider the margin classifier TripleNet (Section 4.2), and the following heuristic approaches.\\n\\u2022 Perplexity: A measure of how confident a model is at making predictions, this can be leveraged for measuring attribution by computing the perplexity of $m_{b}$ relative to the response of $m_{f}$ to prompt $p$ .\\n\\n\\u2022 Heuristic Decision Tree $(H D T)$ : Using $K_{U}$ we can use knowledge of $B$ to create a series of discriminative heuristics to categorise $F$ as used by the winning solution to the first MLMAC7.\\n\\u2022 Exact Match: Attribute responses mf to mb when both models respond the same to a prompt.

Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of the distinctive fea-\\ntures that set our work apart from the most closely related benchmarks in the field.\\nRLBench (James et al., 2020) and ManiSkill2 (Mu et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2023) are two recent\\nlarge-scale benchmarks for robot learning with a large variety of tasks with both, proprioceptive\\nand visual data. However, the demonstrations are generated through motion planning and are hence\\nlacking diversity. Meta-World is another robot learning benchmark with 50 different tasks and a\\nfocus on multi-task reinforcement learning (Yu et al., 2020). Yet, no human demonstrations exists\\nfor these tasks and most tasks typically only have one solution. D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) proposed\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nstandardized environments and datasets for offline reinforcement learning with various tasks. Sev-\\neral other benchmarks specialize in areas such as language-guided multitask learning in simulation\\n(Mees et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023; Gong\\net al., 2023), continual learning (Liu et al., 2023) and diverse multi-task real world skill learning\\n(Walke et al., 2023; Bharadhwaj et al., 2023; Heo et al., 2023). A benchmark with a focus on human\\ndemonstrations is Robomimic (Mandlekar et al., 2021), featuring 8 different task in simulation and\\nreal world environments. The demonstrations, collected by multiple people with various degrees of\\nexpertise using the RoboTurk framework (Mandlekar et al., 2018). Yet, the tasks where not designed\\nto show diverse behavior and consequently, non of the tested algorithms was designed to capture the\\ndiversity of the behavior.\\nThe benchmarks most closely related to D3IL are Block-Push (Florence et al., 2022; Shafiullah\\net al., 2022), T-Shape Pushing (Florence et al., 2022) and Relay Kitchen Gupta et al. (2019). While\\nBlock-Push has 4 different modalities, the behavior is generated by a scripted policy and is hence\\nlacking variance and fall-back solutions in the dataset. T-Shape tasks are limited to a maximum of\\ntwo modalities. The Relay Kitchen environment (Gupta et al., 2019) contains 7 different tasks with\\nhuman demonstrations that solve four tasks in sequence but does not require closed-loop sensory\\nfeedback. Further, several recent work have shown to achieve nearly optimal performance (Chi\\net al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) on these benchmarks, limiting further progress in these environments.\\nMoreover, none of the mentioned benchmarks offer metrics to evaluate the diversity of the learned\\nbehavior.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nEnd-to-End Driving.

End-to-end driving streamlines the entire stack from perception to planning\\ninto a single optimizable network. This eliminates the need for manually designing intermediate\\nrepresentations. Following pioneering work [35, 4, 27], a diverse landscape of end-to-end models\\nhas emerged. For instance, an extensive body of end-to-end approaches focuses on closed-loop\\nsimulators, utilizing single-frame cameras, LiDAR point clouds, or a combination of both for expert\\nimitation [7, 11, 36, 8, 52, 43, 44, 12, 24, 57, 22]. More recently, developing end-to-end models\\non open-loop benchmarks has gained traction [20, 21, 25, 54, 32, 50].

The forward simulation is definite and can be obtained by solving the mathematical\\nequations involved inside the physical system. However, the inverse design is nontrivial because there\\nis no such equation that describes the inverse relationship. In addition, the one-to-many mapping\\nissue, meaning multiple different x can lead to similar y, also complicates this problem.\\nFor multilayer structures, the causal factors x refer to the multilayer structure and include the material\\ncomposition m = [m1, m2, . . . , mN] and layer thicknesses t = [t1, t2, . . . , tN], where N denotes\\nthe number of layers. Usually, material mi is a discrete variable, and ti is a continuous variable. On\\nthe other hand, y refers to the optical responses that we hope to design, e.g., spectrum or colors,\\nand can be represented as a vector. TMM [7] can finish the forward prediction and calculate the\\nspectrum y for a given x by solving equations relating to the wave fields at the boundaries of each\\nlayer. However, TMM does not inherently support the reverse computation of deriving x from a given\\ny. In OptoGPT, the model treats the design parameters of x = {[m1, m2, . . . , mN], [t1, t2, . . . , tN]}\\nas a sequence of x = {[m1, t1], [m2, t2], . . . , [mN, tN]} and uses sequential generation to design\\nmultilayer structures layer-by-layer when given input y as a condition. In their consideration, at\\neach layer, there are 18 different types of materials and 50 different thicknesses discretized by 10nm\\nranging from 10nm to 500nm. The maximum number of layers is 20. Therefore, the size of the\\n3\\nbining genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization method to actively perturb the\\ngenerated data towards the OOD region.\\n\\u2022 We define an evaluation metric to balance the design accuracy as well as the distance away\\nfrom the original dataset region in the corresponding spectrum space.

Then we propose a new TM-augmented NMT on the basis of the two techniques to address the contradictory phenomenon as presented in $\\\\S1$ . Finally we empirically quantify the variance and bias for the proposed TM-augmented NMT. Note that the proposed TM-augmented NMT is general enough to be applied on top of any specifc TMaugmented NMT models.\\n4.1 Two Techniques to Reduce Variance Technique 1: Conditioning on One TM Sentence In conventional TM-augmented NMT, the translation model $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ is conditioned on $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ consisting of fve2 retrieved TMs $\\\\{{\\\\bf z}_{1},{\\\\bf z}_{2},{\\\\bf z}_{3},{\\\\bf z}_{4},{\\\\bf z}_{5}\\\\}$ with $\\\\mathbf z_{i}=(\\\\mathbf x_{i}^{\\\\mathrm{tm}},\\\\mathbf y_{i}^{\\\\mathrm{tm}})$ . Similar to the analysis in Eq.(5-6), we can obtain the following equations:\\nwhere ${\\\\bf Z}_{>1}~=~\\\\{{\\\\bf z}_{2},{\\\\bf z}_{3},{\\\\bf z}_{4},{\\\\bf z}_{5}\\\\}$ , and the second equation holds due to the conditional independence assumption in Eq. (6). In this sense, we can see that $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ conditioned on fve retrieved\\nTMs is actually an approximation of $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}_{1})$ conditioned on a single retrieved TM $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1}$ . As a result, as analysed in $\\\\S3.1$ , whether $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ is a good estimator depends on the variance with respect to $\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1}$ , i.e., $\\\\mathbb{V}_{\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1}}P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1})$ .\\nBased on the above analyses, to alleviate the variance, we directly estimate $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ by using a single sampled sentence pair. Formally, suppose $\\\\textbf{z}=\\\\mathbf{\\\\nabla}\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm{{tm}}},\\\\mathbf{y}^{\\\\mathrm{{tm}}}\\\\rangle$ is a single bilingual sentence sampled from $P(\\\\mathbf{z}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ , we adopt the following TMaugmented NMT conditioned on a single retrieved sentence $\\\\mathbf{z}$ :\\nwhere $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ can be any model architecture of TM-augmented NMT models $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf Z)$ by replacing top- $K$ TMs $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ with a single top-1 TM $\\\\mathbf{z}$ . In addition, the training of the above model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ is the same as the training of the conventional model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf Z)$ .\\nTechnique 2: Enlarging the Sample Size In Eq. (12), $\\\\mathbb{E}_{z}P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}_{<t},\\\\mathbf{z})$ is approximated by one sample $\\\\mathbf{z}$ , which still induces some potential estimation errors due to the variance $\\\\mathbb{V}_{\\\\mathbf{z}}P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}_{<t},\\\\mathbf{z})$ . In fact, the estimation errors can be further reduced by the estimation using multiple samples as follows.\\nProposition 1. If $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\cdots,\\\\mathbf{z}_{K}$ are independent and identically distributed random variables sampled from the $P(\\\\mathbf{z}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ , then the following inequality holds (The proof is presented in Appendix A.):\\nAccording to the above Proposition, we propose the method to approximate $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t})$ through the average ensemble of all $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z_{k})$ :\\nNote that we do not particularly retrain the averaged ensemble model by directly taking the parameters from the model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ trained in Technique 1 above in this paper.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We consider different configurations for BERT classifiers based on the input representations $\\\\mathbf{I_{B}},\\\\mathbf{I_{F}}$ or $\\\\mathbf{I_{B+F}}$ , and the prompts used P1, P2, P3 or $\\\\bf P1+P2$ described in Section 4.1.1.\\nWe also consider the margin classifier TripleNet (Section 4.2), and the following heuristic approaches.\\n\\u2022 Perplexity: A measure of how confident a model is at making predictions, this can be leveraged for measuring attribution by computing the perplexity of $m_{b}$ relative to the response of $m_{f}$ to prompt $p$ .\\n\\n\\u2022 Heuristic Decision Tree $(H D T)$ : Using $K_{U}$ we can use knowledge of $B$ to create a series of discriminative heuristics to categorise $F$ as used by the winning solution to the first MLMAC7.\\n\\u2022 Exact Match: Attribute responses mf to mb when both models respond the same to a prompt.

Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of the distinctive fea-\\ntures that set our work apart from the most closely related benchmarks in the field.\\nRLBench (James et al., 2020) and ManiSkill2 (Mu et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2023) are two recent\\nlarge-scale benchmarks for robot learning with a large variety of tasks with both, proprioceptive\\nand visual data. However, the demonstrations are generated through motion planning and are hence\\nlacking diversity. Meta-World is another robot learning benchmark with 50 different tasks and a\\nfocus on multi-task reinforcement learning (Yu et al., 2020). Yet, no human demonstrations exists\\nfor these tasks and most tasks typically only have one solution. D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) proposed\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nstandardized environments and datasets for offline reinforcement learning with various tasks. Sev-\\neral other benchmarks specialize in areas such as language-guided multitask learning in simulation\\n(Mees et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023; Gong\\net al., 2023), continual learning (Liu et al., 2023) and diverse multi-task real world skill learning\\n(Walke et al., 2023; Bharadhwaj et al., 2023; Heo et al., 2023). A benchmark with a focus on human\\ndemonstrations is Robomimic (Mandlekar et al., 2021), featuring 8 different task in simulation and\\nreal world environments. The demonstrations, collected by multiple people with various degrees of\\nexpertise using the RoboTurk framework (Mandlekar et al., 2018). Yet, the tasks where not designed\\nto show diverse behavior and consequently, non of the tested algorithms was designed to capture the\\ndiversity of the behavior.\\nThe benchmarks most closely related to D3IL are Block-Push (Florence et al., 2022; Shafiullah\\net al., 2022), T-Shape Pushing (Florence et al., 2022) and Relay Kitchen Gupta et al. (2019). While\\nBlock-Push has 4 different modalities, the behavior is generated by a scripted policy and is hence\\nlacking variance and fall-back solutions in the dataset. T-Shape tasks are limited to a maximum of\\ntwo modalities. The Relay Kitchen environment (Gupta et al., 2019) contains 7 different tasks with\\nhuman demonstrations that solve four tasks in sequence but does not require closed-loop sensory\\nfeedback. Further, several recent work have shown to achieve nearly optimal performance (Chi\\net al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) on these benchmarks, limiting further progress in these environments.\\nMoreover, none of the mentioned benchmarks offer metrics to evaluate the diversity of the learned\\nbehavior.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nEnd-to-End Driving. End-to-end driving streamlines the entire stack from perception to planning\\ninto a single optimizable network. This eliminates the need for manually designing intermediate\\nrepresentations. Following pioneering work [35, 4, 27], a diverse landscape of end-to-end models\\nhas emerged. For instance, an extensive body of end-to-end approaches focuses on closed-loop\\nsimulators, utilizing single-frame cameras, LiDAR point clouds, or a combination of both for expert\\nimitation [7, 11, 36, 8, 52, 43, 44, 12, 24, 57, 22]. More recently, developing end-to-end models\\non open-loop benchmarks has gained traction [20, 21, 25, 54, 32, 50]. Our work introduces a new\\nevaluation scheme with which we compare end-to-end models from both communities.\\nClosed-Loop Benchmarking with Simulation. Driving simulators allow us to evaluate autonomous\\nsystems in a closed-loop manner and collect downstream driving statistics, including collision rates,\\ntraffic-rule compliance, or comfort. A broad body of research conducts evaluations in simulators,\\nsuch as CARLA [17] or Metadrive [29] with sensor simulation, or nuPlan [26] and Waymax [19]\\nfor data-driven simulation. Unfortunately, ensuring realism when simulating traffic behavior or\\nsensor data remains a challenging task. To simulate camera or LiDAR sensors, most established\\nsimulators rely on graphics-based rendering methods, leading to an inherent domain gap in terms\\nof visual fidelity and sensor characteristics. Data-driven simulators for motion planning incorporate\\ntraffic recordings but do not support image or LiDAR-based methods [26, 19, 13]. Data-driven\\nsensor simulation leverages and adapts real-world sensor data to create new simulations where the\\nvehicle may move differently, but the rendering quality of existing tools is subpar [1, 2, 49]. Further,\\nwhile promising image [47] or LiDAR [34] synthesis approaches exist, efficiently simulating sensors\\nentirely from data remains an open problem. In this work, we provide an approach for the evaluation\\nof real sensor data with simulation-based metrics by making a simplifying assumption that the agent\\nand environment do not influence each other over a short simulation horizon. Despite this strong\\nassumption, when benchmarking on real data, NAVSIM better reflects planning performance than\\nestablished evaluation protocols, as demonstrated through our systematic experimental analysis.\\nOpen-Loop Benchmarking with Displacement Errors. Open-loop evaluation protocols commonly\\nmeasure displacement errors between trajectories of a recorded expert (i.e., of a human driver)\\nand a motion planner. However, several issues concerning evaluation with displacement errors\\nhave surfaced recently, particularly on the nuScenes dataset [5]. Given that nuScenes does not\\nprovide standardized planning metrics, prior work relied on independent implementations, which\\nled to inconsistencies when reporting or comparing results [50, 32]. Next, most planning models in\\nnuScenes receive the human trajectory endpoint as a discrete direction command [20, 21, 25, 32, 50],\\nthereby leaking ground-truth information into inputs. Moreover, about 75% of the scenarios in\\nnuScenes involve trivial straight driving [32], leading to simple solutions when extrapolating the\\nego-motion. For instance, AD-MLP demonstrates that an MLP on the kinematic ego status (ignoring\\nperception completely) can achieve state-of-the-art displacement errors [56]. Such blind agents are\\nundeniably dangerous, which highlights a broader concern: displacement metrics are not correlated to\\nclosed-loop driving [14, 17, 3, 16]. In this work, we address prevalent issues of nuScenes and propose\\na standardized driving benchmark with challenging scenarios and an official evaluation server. We\\nderive a navigation goal from the lane graph instead of the human trajectory to prevent label leakage,\\nand propose principled simulation-based metrics as an alternative to displacement errors.\\n3\\nNAVSIM: Non-Reactive Autonomous Vehicle Simulation\\nNAVSIM combines the ease of use of open-loop benchmarks such as nuScenes [5] with metrics based\\non closed-loop simulators such as nuPlan [26]. In the following, we give a detailed introduction to\\nthe task and metrics that driving agents are challenged with in NAVSIM. Subsequently, we propose a\\nfiltering method to obtain standardized train and test splits covering challenging scenes.\\n3\\nContributions. (1) We build NAVSIM, a framework for non-reactive AV simulation, with standard-\\nized protocols for training and testing, data curation tools ensuring broad accessibility, and an official\\npublic evaluation server used for the inaugural NAVSIM challenge. (2) We develop configurable\\nsimulation-based metrics that are well-suited for evaluating sensor-based motion planning.

The terms\\nOOD generalization, (distributional) robustness, or just generalization are used interchangeably by\\nthe community. This work mainly focuses on standard datasets that share classes with ImageNet.\\nThey include: image renditions (ImageNet-R; Hendrycks et al., 2020), unusual camera views and\\nobject positions (ObjectNet; Barbu et al., 2019), images selected to be difficult for ImageNet-trained\\nResNet-50s (ImageNet-A; Hendrycks et al., 2021) and sketches of ImageNet classes (ImageNet-\\nSketch; Wang et al., 2019). We also consider two datasets commonly considered in-distribution,\\nnamely ImageNet-Val (Deng et al., 2009), and ImageNet-V2 (Recht et al., 2019).\\nID vs. OOD generalization\\nWhile researchers treat the test sets listed above as OOD with respect\\nto the training distribution when they study robustness, this core assumption is rarely scrutinized.\\nLarge-scale language-image models such as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), ALIGN (Jia et al., 2021),\\nor BASIC (Pham et al., 2021) claim exceptional OOD generalization and zero-shot capabilities.\\nFang et al.

A promising solution method to the problem is Transfer Learning, which has\\nbeen investigated in both CV and NLP fields [20, 21, 22, 23]. The most related work in the field of\\nnanophotonics problems is Ref. [24, 25], which solves the OOD problems in forward simulation by\\ngenerating new training data iteratively [24] to enable the model to predict two-dimension photonic\\nattributes (material stiffness and strength level). However, our problem considered here is much\\nmore complicated and difficult since we are considering the inverse problem with high dimensional\\nout-of-distribution data.\\n3\\nMethods\\n3.1\\nProblem Definition\\nIn the scientific domain, considering the causal factors x \\u2208X and the observed physical outcome\\ny \\u2208Y, there are two major problems to be solved: the forward simulation of X \\u2192Y, and the inverse\\ndesign of Y \\u2192X. The forward simulation is definite and can be obtained by solving the mathematical\\nequations involved inside the physical system. However, the inverse design is nontrivial because there\\nis no such equation that describes the inverse relationship. In addition, the one-to-many mapping\\nissue, meaning multiple different x can lead to similar y, also complicates this problem.\\nFor multilayer structures, the causal factors x refer to the multilayer structure and include the material\\ncomposition m = [m1, m2, . . . , mN] and layer thicknesses t = [t1, t2, . . . , tN], where N denotes\\nthe number of layers. Usually, material mi is a discrete variable, and ti is a continuous variable. On\\nthe other hand, y refers to the optical responses that we hope to design, e.g., spectrum or colors,\\nand can be represented as a vector. TMM [7] can finish the forward prediction and calculate the\\nspectrum y for a given x by solving equations relating to the wave fields at the boundaries of each\\nlayer. However, TMM does not inherently support the reverse computation of deriving x from a given\\ny. In OptoGPT, the model treats the design parameters of x = {[m1, m2, . . . , mN], [t1, t2, . . . , tN]}\\nas a sequence of x = {[m1, t1], [m2, t2], . . . , [mN, tN]} and uses sequential generation to design\\nmultilayer structures layer-by-layer when given input y as a condition. In their consideration, at\\neach layer, there are 18 different types of materials and 50 different thicknesses discretized by 10nm\\nranging from 10nm to 500nm. The maximum number of layers is 20. Therefore, the size of the\\n3\\nbining genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization method to actively perturb the\\ngenerated data towards the OOD region.\\n\\u2022 We define an evaluation metric to balance the design accuracy as well as the distance away\\nfrom the original dataset region in the corresponding spectrum space. Using this metric, we\\nare able to visualize the learning effect of our model at different augmentation steps.\\n\\u2022 We demonstrate the proposed methods in the OptoGPT model and achieve much better\\nperformance in many difficult but practical photonic applications.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\n2.1\\nMultilayer Thin Film Inverse Design\\nTraditional inverse design methods for multilayer structures are usually based on heuristic optimiza-\\ntions.

These\\nenvironments incorporate human data, involve intricate sub-tasks, necessitate the manipulation of\\nmultiple objects, and require policies based on closed-loop sensory feedback. Collectively, these\\ncharacteristics significantly enhance the diversity of behavior in D3IL, setting it apart from existing\\nbenchmarks that often lack one or more of these crucial elements.\\nTo measure this diversity, we introduce practical metrics that offer valuable insights into a model\\u2019s\\nability to acquire and replicate diverse behaviors. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-\\nof-the-art methods on our proposed task suite, our research illuminates the effectiveness of these\\nmethods in learning diverse behavior. This contribution not only guides current efforts but also\\nprovides a valuable reference for the development of future imitation learning algorithms.\\n9\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n6\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"CONCLUSION\\nCLIP has demonstrated unprecedented performance on common OOD benchmarks designed origi-\\nnally for ImageNet. Given that the training dataset of CLIP is so large and diverse, it is natural to\\nwonder whether its performance stems from the sheer similarity of many training samples to the\\nbenchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically test if high train-test\\nsimilarity dictates CLIP\\u2019s generalization performance. In our work, we address this by pruning\\naway samples from the training set that are more similar to the test sets than ImageNet samples.\\nModels trained on the pruned dataset do not significantly lose performance and still exhibit stellar\\ngeneralization capabilities far beyond performance-matched ImageNet-trained models. This indicates\\nthat high similarity to the test sets alone can not explain CLIP\\u2019s generalization ability. We hope\\nthis result will prompt the community to investigate other factors that allow models to learn more\\ngeneralizable features from web-scale datasets.\\n9\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nREPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT\\nFor all the basic details of training, pruning, similarity computation, and other analysis, we defer\\nthe reader to Sec. 3.

Then we propose a new TM-augmented NMT on the basis of the two techniques to address the contradictory phenomenon as presented in $\\\\S1$ . Finally we empirically quantify the variance and bias for the proposed TM-augmented NMT. Note that the proposed TM-augmented NMT is general enough to be applied on top of any specifc TMaugmented NMT models.\\n4.1 Two Techniques to Reduce Variance Technique 1: Conditioning on One TM Sentence In conventional TM-augmented NMT, the translation model $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ is conditioned on $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ consisting of fve2 retrieved TMs $\\\\{{\\\\bf z}_{1},{\\\\bf z}_{2},{\\\\bf z}_{3},{\\\\bf z}_{4},{\\\\bf z}_{5}\\\\}$ with $\\\\mathbf z_{i}=(\\\\mathbf x_{i}^{\\\\mathrm{tm}},\\\\mathbf y_{i}^{\\\\mathrm{tm}})$ . Similar to the analysis in Eq.(5-6), we can obtain the following equations:\\nwhere ${\\\\bf Z}_{>1}~=~\\\\{{\\\\bf z}_{2},{\\\\bf z}_{3},{\\\\bf z}_{4},{\\\\bf z}_{5}\\\\}$ , and the second equation holds due to the conditional independence assumption in Eq. (6). In this sense, we can see that $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ conditioned on fve retrieved\\nTMs is actually an approximation of $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}_{1})$ conditioned on a single retrieved TM $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1}$ . As a result, as analysed in $\\\\S3.1$ , whether $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{Z})$ is a good estimator depends on the variance with respect to $\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1}$ , i.e., $\\\\mathbb{V}_{\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1}}P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\mathbf{Z}_{>1})$ .\\nBased on the above analyses, to alleviate the variance, we directly estimate $P(\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ by using a single sampled sentence pair. Formally, suppose $\\\\textbf{z}=\\\\mathbf{\\\\nabla}\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\\\mathrm{{tm}}},\\\\mathbf{y}^{\\\\mathrm{{tm}}}\\\\rangle$ is a single bilingual sentence sampled from $P(\\\\mathbf{z}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ , we adopt the following TMaugmented NMT conditioned on a single retrieved sentence $\\\\mathbf{z}$ :\\nwhere $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ can be any model architecture of TM-augmented NMT models $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf Z)$ by replacing top- $K$ TMs $\\\\mathbf{Z}$ with a single top-1 TM $\\\\mathbf{z}$ . In addition, the training of the above model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ is the same as the training of the conventional model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf Z)$ .\\nTechnique 2: Enlarging the Sample Size In Eq. (12), $\\\\mathbb{E}_{z}P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}_{<t},\\\\mathbf{z})$ is approximated by one sample $\\\\mathbf{z}$ , which still induces some potential estimation errors due to the variance $\\\\mathbb{V}_{\\\\mathbf{z}}P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}_{<t},\\\\mathbf{z})$ . In fact, the estimation errors can be further reduced by the estimation using multiple samples as follows.\\nProposition 1. If $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\cdots,\\\\mathbf{z}_{K}$ are independent and identically distributed random variables sampled from the $P(\\\\mathbf{z}|\\\\mathbf{x})$ , then the following inequality holds (The proof is presented in Appendix A.):\\nAccording to the above Proposition, we propose the method to approximate $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t})$ through the average ensemble of all $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z_{k})$ :\\nNote that we do not particularly retrain the averaged ensemble model by directly taking the parameters from the model $P(y_{t}|\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y_{<t},\\\\mathbf z)$ trained in Technique 1 above in this paper.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We consider different configurations for BERT classifiers based on the input representations $\\\\mathbf{I_{B}},\\\\mathbf{I_{F}}$ or $\\\\mathbf{I_{B+F}}$ , and the prompts used P1, P2, P3 or $\\\\bf P1+P2$ described in Section 4.1.1.\\nWe also consider the margin classifier TripleNet (Section 4.2), and the following heuristic approaches.\\n\\u2022 Perplexity: A measure of how confident a model is at making predictions, this can be leveraged for measuring attribution by computing the perplexity of $m_{b}$ relative to the response of $m_{f}$ to prompt $p$ .\\n\\n\\u2022 Heuristic Decision Tree $(H D T)$ : Using $K_{U}$ we can use knowledge of $B$ to create a series of discriminative heuristics to categorise $F$ as used by the winning solution to the first MLMAC7.\\n\\u2022 Exact Match: Attribute responses mf to mb when both models respond the same to a prompt.
