{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The core idea is that a member sample exhibits more resistance to adversarial perturbations than  a non-member. We compare OSLO against state-of-the-art label-only attacks and demonstrate that, despite requiring only one query, our method significantly outperforms previous attacks in terms of precision and true positive rate (TPR) under the same false positive rates (FPR). For example, compared to previous label-only MIAs, OSLO achieves a TPR that is at least 7$\\\\times$ higher under a 1\\\\% FPR and at least 22$\\\\times$ higher under a 0.1\\\\% FPR on CIFAR100 for a ResNet18 model.

The success of\\nsuch MIAs may lead to severe individual privacy breaches as DL models are often trained on private\\ndata such as medical records [2] and facial images [3]. Existing black-box MIAs fall into two\\ncategories: score-based MIAs [1, 4, 5] and decision-based MIAs [6, 7], also known as label-only\\nMIAs. Score-based attacks assume access to the model\\u2019s output confidence scores, which can be\\ndefended against if the model only outputs a label. In contrast, label-only attacks infer membership\\nbased on the labels returned by the target model, which is a stricter and more practical threat model.\\nState-of-the-art label-only MIAs measure the sample\\u2019s robustness to adversarial perturbations, clas-\\nsifying samples with higher robustness as members. This robustness serves as a proxy for model\\nconfidence, which is typically higher for training samples. These attacks utilize query-based black-\\nbox adversarial attacks [8, 9] to determine the amount of necessary adversarial perturbation for\\neach sample. However, accurately estimating this requires a large number of queries to the model,\\nsometimes up to thousands for each sample. This approach is not only costly but also easily detectable\\n[10]. Furthermore, these attacks often lack precision and are unsuccessful in the low false positive\\nrate regime, as indicated by previous studies [11] and our evaluations.

Table 1 compares OSLO to previous label-only MIAs. OSLO is\\nbased on constructing transfer-based adversarial example, with just enough magnitude of adversarial\\nperturbation added to each sample to cause misclassification if the sample is non-member (but not\\nenough if it is a member) based on a set of source and validation models, a technique that was initially\\nproposed in [12]. Prior work has considered using a fixed threshold of adversarial perturbation across\\nall samples to infer membership status, resulting in a lower precision [7, 6].\\nWe extensively compared OSLO with state-of-the-art label-only methods [7, 6]. Following recent\\nstandards, we evaluated the attacks using metrics such as the true positive rate (TPR) under a low\\nfalse positive rate (FPR) and performed a precision\\/recall analysis. Our results show that previous\\nlabel-only MIAs perfom poorly, exhibiting high false positive rates. In contrast, OSLO achieves high\\nprecision in identifying members, outperforming prior work by a significant margin. For example,\\nas shown in Figure 2, OSLO is 5\\u00d7 to 67\\u00d7 more powerful than other label-only MIAs in terms of\\nTPR under 0.1% FPR across three datasets using a ResNet18 [13] model. OSLO achieves over 95%\\nprecision on all three datasets on ResNet18 model with a recall greater than 0.01, while the highest\\nprecision achieved by other attacks is only 71.4%, 84.2%, and 67.9% respectively. Furthermore,\\nwe conduct a detailed comparison of OSLO with previous work, exploring why previous label-only\\nattacks fail to achieve high precision.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Background and preliminaries\",\"section_content\":\"Background and preliminaries\\n2.1\\nAdversarial attacks\\nEarly works [14, 15] have demonstrated the susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adver-\\nsarial attacks. These attacks involve crafting subtle perturbations to input data, causing a DNN to\\n2\\nmake incorrect predictions while the perturbations remain almost imperceptible to humans. Adversar-\\nial attacks can significantly compromise model performance, resulting in issues like misclassification\\nor misgeneration. These attacks are typically classified based on the adversary\\u2019s level of access to the\\nmodel [16]: white-box and black-box settings. In white-box attacks [17, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21], adver-\\nsaries have full knowledge of the victim model, including its architecture, parameters, and gradients.\\nIn contrast, black-box attacks [22, 23] limit adversaries to querying the model and obtaining output\\nlabels or confidence scores. We primarily discuss black-box attacks to align with the threat model of\\nour MIA settings.\\nBlack-box adversarial attacks.\\nBlack-box attacks primarily include two methods: (i) Query-\\nbased attacks iteratively query the target model to gather information and craft adversarial examples,\\nadjusting perturbations based on the model\\u2019s feedback. These attacks often require many queries\\nto be effective. (ii) Transfer-based attacks generate adversarial examples using a white-box model\\nand then transfer these examples to attack another model. Previous works have proposed various\\ntransfer-based attacks. For instance, Momentum Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (MI-FGSM)\\n[21] introduces momentum iterative gradient-based methods for generating adversarial examples to\\neffectively attack both white-box and black-box models. Diverse Inputs Iterative Fast Gradient Sign\\nMethod (DI2-FGSM) [24] enhances the transferability of adversarial examples by applying random\\ntransformations to input images at each iteration of the attack process. Translation-Invariant Fast\\nGradient Sign Method (TI-FGSM) [25] optimizes perturbations over a set of translated images to make\\nthe adversarial examples less sensitive to specific model features and improve their transferability.\\nAdmix [26] enhances traditional input transformations by mixing the input image with images from\\nother categories to create admixed images. These admixed images are used to compute gradients,\\nhelping to create more transferable adversarial examples.\\n2.2\\nMembership inference attacks\\nMembership inference attacks (MIAs) [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] aim to determine whether a specific\\ndata sample is a member of the training dataset of a target model. Existing MIAs often assume that\\nthe attacker can access the target model\\u2019s confidence scores to infer membership. These score-based\\nattacks exploit the difference in confidence scores for training versus non-training data, as models\\noften exhibit higher confidence for samples they have seen during training [1, 4, 5]. Such attacks\\ncan be easily defended by limiting access to only the predicted labels, which reduces the amount of\\ninformation available to the attacker.\\nLabel-Only MIAs.\\nCompared to score-based attacks, a more practical and stringent type of attack\\nis decision-based or label-only MIAs [7, 31], which operate under the constraint of having access\\nonly to the final decision labels. Several label-only attacks have been proposed. For example, inspired\\nby the transferability of adversarial examples, transfer attacks [31] explore the transferability of\\nmembership information. They use a shadow dataset labeled by the target model to train a shadow\\nmodel and perform a score-based attack on the shadow model, expecting that the differences between\\nmembers and non-members in the target model will reflect similarly in the shadow model. Data\\naugmentation attacks [7] exploit the robustness of samples to data augmentation transformations to\\ndifferentiate members from non-members, with higher robustness indicating membership. Similarly,\\nstate-of-the-art label-only MIAs, known as boundary attacks [31, 7], use the robustness of samples to\\nstrategic input perturbations as label-only proxies for the model\\u2019s confidence, where higher robustness\\nimplies a higher confidence score. Boundary attacks have different methods for adding perturbations.\\nFor example, Gaussian noise is one method where the attacker continuously adds Gaussian noise\\nuntil the label changes. Attackers also use adversarial attacks to measure the robustness of samples to\\nadversarial perturbations. Specifically, query-based adversarial attacks like HopSkipJump [9] and\\nQEBA [8] algorithms are used to add perturbations to each sample to generate adversarial examples.\\nExisting label-only MIAs typically require many queries to be effective [6, 7] and struggle to achieve\\nhigh TPRs at low FPRs [11]. A recent work YOQO [34] reduced the query budget. However,\\nby design, it cannot adjust the TPR-FPR trade-off and remains ineffective in the low FPR regime,\\nlimiting its practicality.\\n3\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"OSLO\",\"section_content\":\"OSLO\\n3.1\\nProblem definition\\nFollowing Ye et al. [35] and Leemann et al. [36], we view MIA as a hypothesis testing problem:\\nH0 : (x, y) \\/\\n\\u2208D\\nvs\\nH1 : (x, y) \\u2208D\\n(1)\\nSuccessfully rejecting the null hypothesis equates to determining that the sample (x, y) is a member\\nin the target model\\u2019s training set D. Given a sample for inference, we initially assume that the sample\\nis a non-member (H0). Our objective is to design an attack method that can reject the null hypothesis\\nwith high confidence.\\n3.2\\nThreat model\\nAttacker\\u2019s capability.\\nGiven a target model f, we assume that the attacker can only access f in a\\nblack-box manner, meaning that means that for any input x, the attacker can only observe f(x) but\\ncannot access the internal parameters \\u03b8 or any intermediate outputs of f. Furthermore, we consider a\\nmore restrictive scenario: label-only access, where the attacker can only obtain the predicted labels\\n(i.e., \\u02c6\\ny = arg max f(x)) from the target model, not the confidence scores or probabilities associated\\nwith each class. This label-only, black-box attack scenario represents one of the most challenging\\nand realistic settings for conducting attacks against DL models. Similar to previous attacks [1, 7], it\\nis assumed that the attacker possesses an auxiliary dataset Daux that shares the same distribution as\\nthe target model\\u2019s training set for the purpose of training their surrogate models. However, we do not\\nassume the attacker has any knowledge of the target model, including its architecture.\\nAttacker\\u2019s goal.\\nThe attacker\\u2019s objective is to reliably infer whether a given sample is a member of\\nthe target model\\u2019s training set with high precision. As underscored by Carlini et al. [5], identifying\\nindividuals within sensitive datasets with high precision poses a significant privacy risk, even if only\\na few users are correctly identified. Moreover, the precision of these attacks is not just a concern for\\nindividual privacy; it also lays the groundwork for more advanced extraction attacks [37], making\\nthe pursuit of high precision in MIAs a critical focus for attackers. Additionally, the attacker aims to\\ninfer membership with as few queries as possible, as excessive querying not only incurs significant\\ncosts but is also detectable by defenders [10]. Our OSLO limits the query budget to a single query.\\n3.3\\nIntuition of OSLO\\nPrevious work [4, 1] has demonstrated that target models tend to be overconfident on members.\\nexisting label-only attacks [6, 7] suggest that models are more confident about members, making it\\nmore diffficult to \\\"change their mind\\\" on these samples. Their experiments also show that members\\nare usually more robust to adversarial perturbations than non-members. We believe that the differences\\nin the required adversarial perturbation between members and non-members can manifest in two\\nways: (i) on average, members tend to require more adversarial perturbation than non-members;\\nand (ii) for each individual sample, the member status may demand more adversarial perturbation\\nthan the non-member status. Previous label-only MIAs [6, 7] have exploited the former observation,\\nbut this has led to high false positive rates and low precision. Our OSLO is based on the latter.\\nWe add just enough adversarial perturbation to cause a misclassification for the sample if it is a\\nnon-member but not if it is a member. If the sample is not successfully misclassified, it indicates that\\nthe added perturbation was insufficient, and the sample is likely a member. Note that here, \\u2019sufficient\\nperturbation\\u2019 refers to a variable standard for each sample, changing with the sample, rather than a\\nuniform standard for all samples.\\n3.4\\nAttack method\\nPrevious label-only MIAs face two main issues: low precision and high query budget. We address\\nboth issues simultaneously by proposing our transfer-based adversarial attack based attack, which\\nimplements the aforementioned hypothesis testing framework. Specifically, we first train a group\\nof surrogate models. For each sample, we construct a transferable adversarial example using the\\nsurrogate model(s). Then, we input the crafted adversarial example into the target model and obtain\\n4\\nthe predicted label. If the sample is misclassified, it indicates that the adversarial example has\\nsuccessfully transferred, implying that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis\\nH0. Otherwise, we reject H0 and determine the sample as a member. It is worth noting that the\\nperturbation added to each sample should be sufficient for it to transfer as a non-member but not\\nas a member. Therefore, carefully controlling the scale of perturbation added to each sample is\\nrequired. The framework of OSLO is divided into three stages: surrogate model training, transferable\\nadversarial example construction, and membership inference.\\nSurrogate model training.\\nThe attackers first train their own surrogate models to construct adver-\\nsarial examples. As assumed in Section 3.2, we assume that the attacker has an auxiliary dataset\\nwith the same distribution as the target model\\u2019s training set. The attacker trains a group of models\\nwith different structures on this dataset, training N models for each structure. These models are\\nthen divided into source models and validation models based on different purposes in the adversarial\\nexample generation stage. Source models are used to calculate gradients for generating adversarial\\nperturbations, while validation models are used to control the magnitude of the added perturbations.\\nAlgorithm 1: Transferable adversarial exam-\\nple generation.\\nInput: Benign input x with label y; source\\nmodels g; validation model h; number\\nof sub-procedures K; number of\\niterations N; step size \\u03b1; maximum\\nperturbation size \\u03f5 and threshold \\u03c4;\\nOutput: Transfer-based unrestricted\\nadversarial example x\\u2032 with\\napproximately minimum change;\\nx0 \\u2190x;\\nfor k = 1, 2, . . . , K do\\nx\\u2032\\n0 \\u2190xk\\u22121;\\nfor i = 1 to N do\\nCompute gradient:\\ngi \\u2190\\u2207xL(g(x\\u2032\\ni\\u22121, y);\\nUpdate adversarial example using the\\nupdate function:\\nx\\u2032\\ni \\u2190Update(x\\u2032\\ni\\u22121, gi, \\u03b1);\\nClip x\\u2032\\ni to ensure it is within the\\nk\\u03f5\\nK -ball of x:\\nx\\u2032\\ni \\u2190clip(x\\u2032\\ni, x \\u2212k\\u03f5\\nK , x + k\\u03f5\\nK );\\nconf \\u2190\\nexp(hy(x\\u2032\\ni))\\nP\\nj exp(hj(x\\u2032\\ni));\\nif conf < \\u03c4 then\\nreturn x\\u2032\\ni; \\/\\/ early-stopping\\ncriterion\\nend\\nend\\nxk \\u2190x\\u2032\\nN;\\nend\\nreturn xK;\\nTransferable adversarial example generation.\\nAfter the source models are trained, the attacker\\ngenerates adversarial examples on these models\\nusing transfer-based adversarial attacks. Exist-\\ning transfer-based attacks typically search for\\nadversarial examples within a fixed lp-norm ball\\nand do not minimize the perturbation added. In\\nother words, these attacks allocate a uniform per-\\nturbation budget \\u03f5 to all samples, accepting any\\nadversarial examples found within this budget.\\nWhile this approach is reasonable in the context\\nof general adversarial attacks, it is not suitable\\nfor our MIA framework, as OSLO requires finer-\\ngrained control over the amount of perturbation\\nadded.\\nIn OSLO, the perturbation budget for each sam-\\nple is adaptive.\\nSpecifically, we utilize the\\nGeometry-Aware (GA) framework proposed in\\n[12], which employs a set of validation models\\nto regulate the amount of perturbation added to\\neach sample. The process of adding perturba-\\ntions is incremental. During this process, vali-\\ndation models are used to monitor the transfer-\\nability of the sample. The perturbation addition\\nprocess is terminated early\\u2014referred to as early\\nstopping\\u2014when the perturbation added is suf-\\nficient for the sample to deceive the validation\\nmodel, and the confidence of the correct class\\non the validation model drops below a specified\\nthreshold \\u03c4:\\nP(\\u02c6\\nh(x) = y) =\\nexp(hy(x; \\u03b8))\\nP\\nj exp(hj(x; \\u03b8)) < \\u03c4.\\n(2)\\nwhere hj(x; \\u03b8) denotes the logits for class j produced by the validation model, and y is the ground\\ntruth class. Through this method, the process can be terminated when the transferability of each\\nsample reaches a certain level, resulting in tailored perturbations for each sample. This can more\\neffectively distinguish the differences of the sample in the in and out worlds.\\nAlgorithm 1 outlines our method for generating transferable adversarial examples, adapted from Liu\\net al.\\u2019s GA framework [12] to align with our objective. The algorithm inputs with a benign sample x\\nwith its corresponding label y, a set of source models denoted as g, and a set of validation models h.\\nThe algorithm proceeds through K sub-procedures, each conducting an iterative refinement of the\\n5\\nadversarial example across N iterations, guided by a pre-established step size \\u03b1 and bounded by a\\nmaximal perturbation magnitude \\u03f5. At each iteration, the gradient of the loss function L with respect\\nto the adversarial input is computed, informing the perturbative update. This process is modulated by\\nthe validation model h. If at any step the confidence of the ground-truth class falls below the threshold\\n\\u03c4, the early stopping is triggered to prevent over-perturbation, thus ensuring that the perturbations are\\nprecisely calibrated for each sample.\\nMembership inference.\\nFinally, for each sample x, the attacker inputs the transferable adversarial\\nexample x\\u2032, generated by Algorithm 1, into the target model f. The classification outcome determines\\nthe evidence against the null hypothesis H0. If arg maxi f(x\\u2032)i \\u0338= y, it suggests insufficient evidence\\nto reject H0. In contrast, a classification of arg maxi f(x\\u2032)i = y allows us to reject H0, hence\\nclassifying x as a member. Our membership inference strategy seeks to reject H0 with high confidence,\\naiming to achieve high precision in the identification of members.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
