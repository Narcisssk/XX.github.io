{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, this success comes with potential privacy risks, as the models process vast amounts of data that might contain personal or sensitive information and may abuse or leak it. For instance, information can be leaked by model inversion (Li et al., 2017), re-identifcation techniques (Lison et al., 2021; Ben Cheikh Larbi et al., 2023), exploitation of feature memorization within the LLM (Carlini et al., 2021), and more. Offering LLMs as cloud services, such as ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), might also impose potential threats to privacy if the server exhibits a semi-honest stance, actively seeking to glean more insights from the input than is appropriate or by a possible eavesdropper intercepting the input sent to the server.\\n\\nIn order to safeguard privacy, many privacypreserving techniques have been proposed, based on the local differential privacy framework (LDP; Arachchige et al., 2019). In this framework, the user applies a differential privacy mechanism, which can be hosted on a local server, and then sends the privatized data to the remote server. This approach doesn\\u2019t require trust from the remote server, and protects the data against potential eavesdroppers. In general, any privacy mechanism can be applied at one or several components of the LLM pipeline. Figure 1 depicts these components: at the text level (text privatization), after the tokenization process (token privatization), after the initial embedding lookup (token embedding privatization), or after applying several layers of the encoder (sequence embedding privatization).\\nCurrently, most privacy-preserving strategies focus on incorporating noise into sequence embedding vectors. The rationale behind this strategy is to minimize the privacy-preserving technique\\u2019s impact on the downstream task. Specifcally, most systems frst obtain a sequence embedding representation, either by assuming partial access to the remote model (Zhou et al., 2022; Lyu et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2021) or by using a dedicated model to create these embeddings (Li et al., 2018; Coavoux et al., 2018; Mosallanezhad et al., 2019; Plant et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023). Afterwards, random noise is incorporated into the embeddings, thus concealing the original input. However, this approach relies on partial access to the remote model, on the ability to provide input to the remote model in vector form, or on suffcient computational and memory resources on the user\\u2019s end. These are often not the case. In addition, Kugler et al. (2021) showed that publishing a model\\u2019s encoder along with the contextualized embeddings allows an adversary to generate data to train a decoder with a high level of reconstruction accuracy, making these approaches highly susceptible to violation of privacy.\\n\\nWe propose a secure way to use LLMs without assuming access to their parameters. In our framework, both input and output for the privacyproviding mechanism must be given in a token sequence format, eliminating the need to intervene with the LLM\\u2019s pre-training procedure or text processing. We focus on applying privacy preservation techniques at the token level, corresponding to layer (B) in Figure 1.\\nSpecifcally, we propose two privacy-preserving techniques based on manipulating the input token sequence. The frst set of techniques relies on na\\u00efve rules of token substitution. The second is based on leveraging contextual information to strategically replace tokens, aiming to retain as much actionable information as possible for the classifer to minimize the impact on the performance of the downstream task.\\nWe test these techniques both for their impact on the downstream task accuracy and for their resilience against reconstruction attacks. We fnd that replacing tokens based on simple rules is easy for a knowledgeable attacker to reverse, while manipulating tokens based on contextual information can enhance privacy without sacrifcing much of the performance.1\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Lossy Mapping\",\"section_content\":\"In order to protect against potential eavesdropping by a middle party, under the assumption that the layers of LLMs are inaccessible to the local device, we start by employing several mapping functions on the tokens of the input text available at the local device. Our initial, na\\u00efve mapping functions introduce a random noise component that follows a specifc rule: the vocabulary is partitioned into pairs of tokens $(u,v)$ , or triplets $(u,v,z)$ , and when encountered in an input text to be manipulated, all tokens are mapped to a single representative token of their tuple, without loss of generality $u$ . This strategy produces outputs that are inherently ambiguous, blocking any potential eavesdroppers from recovering the original input text deterministically, given that a many-to-one mapping is not invertible. The only available recourse for an attacker is a statistical strategy, which imposes assumptions on the properties of the input, for example that it was grammatical English text written by a speaker with high profciency. Indeed, even if an eavesdropper obtains full information of the privacy system, i.e. the partition into token tuples and each tuple\\u2019s representative token, each mapped sequence of length $m$ still generates a candidate set of $2^{m}$ or $3^{m}$ possible permutations (depending on tuple size) through which the attacker must search. We will examine the practical implications of this large search space later in the section.\\n\\nFor our stated use case of manipulating text being input into a sequence classifer operating atop an LLM, there are two distinct scenarios depending on when we may apply our manipulation. The frst scenario involves applying the manipulation process only during the inference phase of a model trained on regular, unmanipulated text, which we will refer to as the TEST case. This operation mode simulates a query sent by a user to an alreadytrained model, such as a user interacting with ChatGPT or another model allowing only inference text interaction via user interface or an API. In the second scenario, which we call ALL, we also apply the manipulation during the training phase, protecting sensitive information in the training data, hoping that the inference phase will now leverage the model\\u2019s ability to handle manipulated input as expected and produce better results. In this scenario the model does not inadvertently learn or memorize the sensitive data during the training process, nor does it spend learning resources on tokens never to be seen during inference, but since it is not always possible to assume its availability, we perform our experiments in both settings.\\nWhen protecting the original input data, it is essential for the mapper to have minimal impact on the performance of the downstream task, defning the fundamental trade-off in our study. Therefore, the selection process for grouping tokens and selecting each tuple\\u2019s representative token is crucial, as it aims to both minimize the mapping\\u2019s effect on the downstream task and hinder the attacker\\u2019s ability to uncover the original text. We consider the following mapping functions:\\nPurely random mapping the selection of the token pairs tuples from the vocabulary and of each tuple\\u2019s representative is uniformly random.\\nHigh-frequency mapping token pairs are selected based on their frequency of occurrence in a tokenized corpus, such as Wikipedia (Foundation, 2023). This involves pairing a higher-frequency token with a lower-frequency token, with the higherfrequency token being designated as the representative. In our mapper, given a vocabulary of even size $V$ , sorted by descending frequency, each token with rank $\\\\begin{array}{r}{1\\\\leq k\\\\leq\\\\frac{V}{2}}\\\\end{array}$ is paired with the token of rank $k+\\\\frac{V}{2}$ . While selecting the high-frequency token as the representative may have a lesser impact on the downstream task, it could potentially weaken the privacy-preserving characteristics, depending on the knowledge possessed by the attacker.\\nLow-frequency mapping the process is similar to that of the higher-frequency mapper, except that the lower-frequency token is chosen as the representative. Opting for less-frequent tokens as representatives can aid in preserving privacy, but it will likely harm the downstream task.\\nDue to the simplicity of these mapping strategies, we consider them baselines for further research and developing better, potentially language-aware strategies. In addition, these mapping functions can easily be generalized to larger tuples, expanding the search space even further, but greatly harming downstream task performance as a result of a much more restricted active vocabulary.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.1 Task Performance\",\"section_content\":\"To assess the impact of the baseline models on downstream task performance, we use two datasets for sequence classifcation: SST2 (Socher et al., 2013) and IMDb (Maas et al., 2011). The base model chosen was RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art encoder language model known for its strong performance in sequence classifcation tasks. In Table 1, we present the results of four baselines on the two datasets, compared with the null mapping results labeled \\u201cPlain text\\u201d. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the high-frequency baseline achieved the highest accuracy, most likely due to the fact that retaining high-frequency tokens while removing low-frequency ones results in a relatively small number of tokens altered in the datasets. In both datasets this number is roughly $6\\\\%$ , compared with low-frequency mapping\\u2019s complement of $94\\\\%$ and with the randomly-selected sets\\u2019 $50\\\\%$ and $67\\\\%$ , giving a correlative relationship between this number and the performance level: the fewer tokens are altered, the better the model performs. This effect is much more pronounced when only the test set is affected, and the model is dealing not only with loss of information but also with out-of-distribution behavior. In absolute terms, we fnd it remarkable that this alteration of a non-negligible portion of tokens causes only a 1\\u20132 percentage point reduction in performance for the IMDb dataset and still under 5 points for SST2.\\nIn Table 2, we present an example of the outcome of applying the 2-Random and the Highfreq privatization techniques on a random phrase (\\u201cno apparent joy\\u201d) from the SST2 dataset. As expected, the 2-random baseline produces a random sequence of words, whereas the high-frequency mapper leaves the phrase unchanged as the tokens in the original sequence are frequent.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 Brute-force Attacker\",\"section_content\":\"Although the many-to-one mapping function introduces some form of protection against data leakage, in practice, reconstructing the original text might be relatively straightforward under certain circumstances. In particular, if an \\u201coracle\\u201d attacker has access to the token pairings, it can theoretically determine the original text from the pool of $2^{m}$ possible permutations by applying a generative LLM such as GPT (Radford et al., 2019) and picking the most probable sequence. However, generating and evaluating all $2^{m}$ permutations is impractical even for small values of $m$ due to the computational complexity involved. To mitigate this challenge, alternative approaches, such as employing heuristics or utilizing statistical methods, can be explored to narrow down the potential candidates for the original text.\\nTo cope with this task, we describe a heuristic approach to reducing the search space based on beam search (Eisenstein, 2019, $\\\\S11.3.1\\\\rangle$ ) and nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019). In each step of the process, candidates are generated based on the prefxes of tokens that were produced in the previous steps. In the case of token pairs, each prefx sequence is followed by one of two candidate tokens for the next step based on the known (oracle) token pair that the observed representative token belongs to. Unlike conventional beam search, where a fxed number of candidates is retained following each step, we opt for a dynamic approach inspired by nucleus sampling, made possible since the scores for each of the two tokens refect a generative probabilistic process where the relative probability of each interim token sequence on the beam can be estimated and used for dropping highly unlikely sequence prefxes. This means that the number of candidates remaining on the beam varies at each step, adapting to their likelihood and ensuring fexibility in the selection process. We estimate the likelihood of each candidate prefx using a language model.2 After all prefxes on the beam have been scored, we remove the least probable candidates such that the total probability of the remaining candidates exceeds a certain threshold $\\\\pi$ set by computational constraints but maintaining discoverability. Since the probability of a sequence cannot exceed that of its prefx, the process guarantees that complete sequences that are likely are not being discarded before getting the chance to be fully generated. Overall, this process effectively eliminates highly unlikely candidates, dramatically reducing the search space during its application and streamlining the computational efforts.\\n\\nThis process is illustrated in Figure 2. The \\u201coracle\\u201d attacker gains access to the remapped words: $(\\\\,\\\\mathtt{w h a t}\\\\,,\\\\,\\\\mathtt{a}\\\\,)\\\\to\\\\mathtt{a}$ , (nice, is) $\\\\rightarrow$ nice, (day, unicorn) $\\\\rightarrow$ unicorn. In the frst step, two initial candidates (what and $\\\\rightleftharpoons$ ) are generated based on the frst observed token (what). Following the described process, each prefx is evaluated via an LLM to determine its probability, for instance, the probability of what being the frst word is $80\\\\%$ when considering the possible set {[s] what, $[\\\\,S\\\\,]\\\\,\\\\mathrm{~\\\\}\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{\\\\Sigma}}$ . This process is repeated, and the candidates with low probability are removed, such that the total probability of the remaining candidates is above $85\\\\%$ , as indicated by the red boxes. Finally, the probability of the sequence what a beautiful day is the highest, thus the \\u201coracle\\u201d attacker returns it as the inferred original text. We note that the low-frequency and high-frequency mappers, despite their differences in representative token selection, will demonstrate equivalent safeguarding mechanisms against this attacker since the attacker does not factor in the choice of the representative token and examines all potential candidates in its effort to uncover the original text.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.3 Resilience Against Reconstruction Attacks\",\"section_content\":\"In Table 3, we present the outcomes of the attacker\\u2019s endeavors to reveal the original text from the three techniques: 2-Random, 3-Random, and High-freq (equivalent to Low-freq for a knowledgeable attacker). We report the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the correct sequences, the rate of the actual input sequence ranking among the top 5 predictions $(\\\\mathbf{Pr}@5)$ , and the token-level edit distance between the produced top prediction and the original sequence. The relative success of the mappers in thwarting the oracle attacks on the IMDb dataset compared to SST2 can be attributed to the average token sequence length $({\\\\bar{m}})$ , which is 65 and 12, respectively. As sequence length increases, the attacker\\u2019s task of uncovering the original text becomes more challenging.\\nOur results indicate that the na\\u00efve baselines are overly simplistic and allow an easy and straightforward reconstruction, even within a vast search space (although attacker knowledge of the mapping specifcations is required). In cases where performance on the task remains close to that of unmapped text, the recovery price is too high to neglect. Having said that, the computational complexity of applying the na\\u00efve baselines is relatively low, and the greatly reduced active vocabulary brings great savings in parameter budgets, which embedding tables often dominate. In a less powerful attack environment, this would make them an effcient choice for preserving privacy on low-resource devices. We expect future work on more principled many-to-one static mappings would be able to improve both task performance and resilience to attackers, while work on attack strategies can present challenges hitherto unseen.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 STENCIL Privacy Preservation\",\"section_content\":\"In the context of protecting privacy within NLP practices, a widely adopted approach for implementing local differential privacy involves introducing a controlled level of noise into different components of the model, effectively concealing the original input. These components may include sequence embeddings, token embeddings, or the tokens themselves (Mosallanezhad et al., 2019; Feyisetan et al., 2020; Lyu et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022). However, in essence, the success of models in most NLP tasks is primarily attributed to their effective utilization of contextual information. Moreover, our study focuses on token-level privacy preservation, i.e., we assume that the parameters of the LLMs are inaccessible, making the importance of contextual information more pronounced. Therefore, a fundamental limitation associated with incorporating noise is the exclusion of contextual information when defning the noise. This omission may hinder the potential benefts contextual details can offer for maintaining the performance of the downstream tasks.\\nGiven this limitation, we propose a new privacy preservation technique, which we call STENCIL. With this technique, a mapped token in a sequence \\u201cabsorbs\\u201d information from adjacent tokens to form a new context-aware token, effectively concealing the original token while retaining information benefcial for maintaining task performance.\\nIn order to generate the new contextualized token $t_{k}\\\\rightarrow t_{k}^{\\\\prime}$ , we frst retrieve an embedding vector representation of the neighborhood, of size $n+1$ , containing the tokens $t_{i},\\\\forall i\\\\in\\\\{k-n\\/2\\\\dots k+n\\/2\\\\}$ using some embedding lookup table E \\u2208 RV \\u00d7d, which can be trained independently in a preliminary step or obtained from an available model such as the target model itself. We then subject the $n+1$ embedding vector representations to a weighted transformation and incorporate them to form a new \\u201cquasi-embedding\\u201d vector $\\\\begin{array}{r}{\\\\sum_{i=k-n\\/2}^{k+n\\/2}f_{i}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{E}[t_{i}]}\\\\end{array}$ . Finally, we return the token $t_{k}^{\\\\prime}$ that is closest to the quasi-embedding vector in the embedding space, based on cosine-similarity or euclidean distance computation, as an output. To further enhance privacy, we ensure that the new token is different from the original one. Formally, the process can be defned as follows:\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{V}$ is the vocabulary and $f_{i}$ is the weighted transformation function of the tokens such that $\\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{i=k-\\\\frac{n}{2}}^{k+\\\\frac{n}{2}}f_{i}=1$ .\\nThe level of privacy enhancement and its impact on the downstream task by employing the STENCIL method can be managed by adjusting the window size and the properties of the weighted function $f$ . In our study, we use the gaussian smoothing function as the weighted function. Consequently, the standard deviation, $\\\\sigma$ , plays a crucial role in the performance and amount of privacy achieved.\\nAs a baseline for our proposed technique, we adopt Qu et al. (2021)\\u2019s proposed privacypreserving technique. In contrast to our proposed technique, this approach does not consider context but rather incorporates random noise into token embeddings to enhance privacy. The random noise is obtained by multiplying a sample from a Gamma distribution $\\\\Gamma(d,1\\/\\\\eta)$ and a uniform sample from a unit hypersphere, where $\\\\eta$ corresponds to the amount of noise introduced to the original token and $d$ is the dimension of the embedding space.\\nWe note that the most time-intensive operation in both STENCIL and noise-based techniques involves searching for the closest token to the perturbed quasi-embedding vector, while all other operations are negligible in comparison. Overall, the average computational cost per token is 0.005 seconds on two 16-core $3.2~\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ AMD EPYC 7343 Milan processors.\\nTable 4: The best results achieved by the STENCIL mapper and the noise mapper considering the Test and All cases on the SST2, IMDb, and QNLI datasets. $\\\\operatorname{Pr}(\\\\alpha5\\\\$ represents the average token hit managed by the nearestneighbor attacker.\"}\n\n... # only display 8 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"In this paper, we propose several token manipulation methods to preserve privacy under the assumption that the model parameters are inaccessible. We frst introduce four mappers that offer advantages compared to existing privacy-preserving techniques. These mappers operate independently of the LLM and the specifc downstream task, resulting in a high degree of versatility. Additionally, their computational complexity is relatively low, making them effcient choices for privacy preservation on local, low-resource devices. However, these mappers harm the performance of the downstream tasks and can be easily reconstructed by a knowledgeable attacker.\\nThe second mapper class we propose is based on utilizing contextualized information to maintain performance while obfuscating the original input text. This technique achieves higher privacy measures and has less impact on the downstream task, which makes it more applicable for cases where the downstream task is important. Nevertheless, opting for different weighted functions, such as ones based on a trained model, can further help improve both accuracy and privacy.\\nAn inherent problem with existing privacypreserving techniques is their inability to maintain linguistic properties such as grammar and readability (as seen in Table 2) that are crucial for the performance of the model. Therefore, an additional avenue we plan to explore is application of these and similar rules in differential privacy techniques. For instance, following the application of random perturbations to an embedding vector, instead of simply returning the nearest token to the perturbed vector, one could consider returning a token with similar syntactic attributes, such as part of speech, or verbs with similar causative meanings or stable subcategorization frames.\\nLastly, our experiments were limited to classifcation tasks in the English language. In future research, we intend to explore the effectiveness of these methods in generative tasks, across languages, and in multilingual settings.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

We fnd that although some token mapping functions are easy and straightforward to implement, they heavily infuence performance on the downstream task, and via a sophisticated attacker can be reconstructed. In comparison, contextualized manipulation provides an improvement in performance.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Large language models (LLMs) have greatly advanced the feld of NLP in recent years, exhibiting exceptional profciency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including dependency parsing (Duong et al., 2015), natural language understanding (Dong et al., 2019), automatic question-answering (OpenAI, 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022), machine translation (Dabre et al., 2020), text classifcation (Minaee et al., 2021), and many more (Li et al., 2022). However, this success comes with potential privacy risks, as the models process vast amounts of data that might contain personal or sensitive information and may abuse or leak it. For instance, information can be leaked by model inversion (Li et al., 2017), re-identifcation techniques (Lison et al., 2021; Ben Cheikh Larbi et al., 2023), exploitation of feature memorization within the LLM (Carlini et al., 2021), and more. Offering LLMs as cloud services, such as ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), might also impose potential threats to privacy if the server exhibits a semi-honest stance, actively seeking to glean more insights from the input than is appropriate or by a possible eavesdropper intercepting the input sent to the server.\\n\\nIn order to safeguard privacy, many privacypreserving techniques have been proposed, based on the local differential privacy framework (LDP; Arachchige et al., 2019). In this framework, the user applies a differential privacy mechanism, which can be hosted on a local server, and then sends the privatized data to the remote server. This approach doesn\\u2019t require trust from the remote server, and protects the data against potential eavesdroppers. In general, any privacy mechanism can be applied at one or several components of the LLM pipeline. Figure 1 depicts these components: at the text level (text privatization), after the tokenization process (token privatization), after the initial embedding lookup (token embedding privatization), or after applying several layers of the encoder (sequence embedding privatization).\\nCurrently, most privacy-preserving strategies focus on incorporating noise into sequence embedding vectors. The rationale behind this strategy is to minimize the privacy-preserving technique\\u2019s impact on the downstream task. Specifcally, most systems frst obtain a sequence embedding representation, either by assuming partial access to the remote model (Zhou et al., 2022; Lyu et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2021) or by using a dedicated model to create these embeddings (Li et al., 2018; Coavoux et al., 2018; Mosallanezhad et al., 2019; Plant et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023). Afterwards, random noise is incorporated into the embeddings, thus concealing the original input. However, this approach relies on partial access to the remote model, on the ability to provide input to the remote model in vector form, or on suffcient computational and memory resources on the user\\u2019s end. These are often not the case. In addition, Kugler et al. (2021) showed that publishing a model\\u2019s encoder along with the contextualized embeddings allows an adversary to generate data to train a decoder with a high level of reconstruction accuracy, making these approaches highly susceptible to violation of privacy.\\n\\nWe propose a secure way to use LLMs without assuming access to their parameters. In our framework, both input and output for the privacyproviding mechanism must be given in a token sequence format, eliminating the need to intervene with the LLM\\u2019s pre-training procedure or text processing. We focus on applying privacy preservation techniques at the token level, corresponding to layer (B) in Figure 1.\\nSpecifcally, we propose two privacy-preserving techniques based on manipulating the input token sequence. The frst set of techniques relies on na\\u00efve rules of token substitution. The second is based on leveraging contextual information to strategically replace tokens, aiming to retain as much actionable information as possible for the classifer to minimize the impact on the performance of the downstream task.\\nWe test these techniques both for their impact on the downstream task accuracy and for their resilience against reconstruction attacks. We fnd that replacing tokens based on simple rules is easy for a knowledgeable attacker to reverse, while manipulating tokens based on contextual information can enhance privacy without sacrifcing much of the performance.1\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Lossy Mapping\",\"section_content\":\"In order to protect against potential eavesdropping by a middle party, under the assumption that the layers of LLMs are inaccessible to the local device, we start by employing several mapping functions on the tokens of the input text available at the local device. Our initial, na\\u00efve mapping functions introduce a random noise component that follows a specifc rule: the vocabulary is partitioned into pairs of tokens $(u,v)$ , or triplets $(u,v,z)$ , and when encountered in an input text to be manipulated, all tokens are mapped to a single representative token of their tuple, without loss of generality $u$ . This strategy produces outputs that are inherently ambiguous, blocking any potential eavesdroppers from recovering the original input text deterministically, given that a many-to-one mapping is not invertible. The only available recourse for an attacker is a statistical strategy, which imposes assumptions on the properties of the input, for example that it was grammatical English text written by a speaker with high profciency. Indeed, even if an eavesdropper obtains full information of the privacy system, i.e. the partition into token tuples and each tuple\\u2019s representative token, each mapped sequence of length $m$ still generates a candidate set of $2^{m}$ or $3^{m}$ possible permutations (depending on tuple size) through which the attacker must search. We will examine the practical implications of this large search space later in the section.\\n\\nFor our stated use case of manipulating text being input into a sequence classifer operating atop an LLM, there are two distinct scenarios depending on when we may apply our manipulation. The frst scenario involves applying the manipulation process only during the inference phase of a model trained on regular, unmanipulated text, which we will refer to as the TEST case. This operation mode simulates a query sent by a user to an alreadytrained model, such as a user interacting with ChatGPT or another model allowing only inference text interaction via user interface or an API. In the second scenario, which we call ALL, we also apply the manipulation during the training phase, protecting sensitive information in the training data, hoping that the inference phase will now leverage the model\\u2019s ability to handle manipulated input as expected and produce better results. In this scenario the model does not inadvertently learn or memorize the sensitive data during the training process, nor does it spend learning resources on tokens never to be seen during inference, but since it is not always possible to assume its availability, we perform our experiments in both settings.\\nWhen protecting the original input data, it is essential for the mapper to have minimal impact on the performance of the downstream task, defning the fundamental trade-off in our study. Therefore, the selection process for grouping tokens and selecting each tuple\\u2019s representative token is crucial, as it aims to both minimize the mapping\\u2019s effect on the downstream task and hinder the attacker\\u2019s ability to uncover the original text. We consider the following mapping functions:\\nPurely random mapping the selection of the token pairs tuples from the vocabulary and of each tuple\\u2019s representative is uniformly random.\\nHigh-frequency mapping token pairs are selected based on their frequency of occurrence in a tokenized corpus, such as Wikipedia (Foundation, 2023). This involves pairing a higher-frequency token with a lower-frequency token, with the higherfrequency token being designated as the representative. In our mapper, given a vocabulary of even size $V$ , sorted by descending frequency, each token with rank $\\\\begin{array}{r}{1\\\\leq k\\\\leq\\\\frac{V}{2}}\\\\end{array}$ is paired with the token of rank $k+\\\\frac{V}{2}$ . While selecting the high-frequency token as the representative may have a lesser impact on the downstream task, it could potentially weaken the privacy-preserving characteristics, depending on the knowledge possessed by the attacker.\\nLow-frequency mapping the process is similar to that of the higher-frequency mapper, except that the lower-frequency token is chosen as the representative. Opting for less-frequent tokens as representatives can aid in preserving privacy, but it will likely harm the downstream task.\\nDue to the simplicity of these mapping strategies, we consider them baselines for further research and developing better, potentially language-aware strategies. In addition, these mapping functions can easily be generalized to larger tuples, expanding the search space even further, but greatly harming downstream task performance as a result of a much more restricted active vocabulary.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.1 Task Performance\",\"section_content\":\"To assess the impact of the baseline models on downstream task performance, we use two datasets for sequence classifcation: SST2 (Socher et al., 2013) and IMDb (Maas et al., 2011). The base model chosen was RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art encoder language model known for its strong performance in sequence classifcation tasks. In Table 1, we present the results of four baselines on the two datasets, compared with the null mapping results labeled \\u201cPlain text\\u201d. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the high-frequency baseline achieved the highest accuracy, most likely due to the fact that retaining high-frequency tokens while removing low-frequency ones results in a relatively small number of tokens altered in the datasets. In both datasets this number is roughly $6\\\\%$ , compared with low-frequency mapping\\u2019s complement of $94\\\\%$ and with the randomly-selected sets\\u2019 $50\\\\%$ and $67\\\\%$ , giving a correlative relationship between this number and the performance level: the fewer tokens are altered, the better the model performs. This effect is much more pronounced when only the test set is affected, and the model is dealing not only with loss of information but also with out-of-distribution behavior. In absolute terms, we fnd it remarkable that this alteration of a non-negligible portion of tokens causes only a 1\\u20132 percentage point reduction in performance for the IMDb dataset and still under 5 points for SST2.\\nIn Table 2, we present an example of the outcome of applying the 2-Random and the Highfreq privatization techniques on a random phrase (\\u201cno apparent joy\\u201d) from the SST2 dataset. As expected, the 2-random baseline produces a random sequence of words, whereas the high-frequency mapper leaves the phrase unchanged as the tokens in the original sequence are frequent.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 Brute-force Attacker\",\"section_content\":\"Although the many-to-one mapping function introduces some form of protection against data leakage, in practice, reconstructing the original text might be relatively straightforward under certain circumstances. In particular, if an \\u201coracle\\u201d attacker has access to the token pairings, it can theoretically determine the original text from the pool of $2^{m}$ possible permutations by applying a generative LLM such as GPT (Radford et al., 2019) and picking the most probable sequence. However, generating and evaluating all $2^{m}$ permutations is impractical even for small values of $m$ due to the computational complexity involved. To mitigate this challenge, alternative approaches, such as employing heuristics or utilizing statistical methods, can be explored to narrow down the potential candidates for the original text.\\nTo cope with this task, we describe a heuristic approach to reducing the search space based on beam search (Eisenstein, 2019, $\\\\S11.3.1\\\\rangle$ ) and nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2019). In each step of the process, candidates are generated based on the prefxes of tokens that were produced in the previous steps. In the case of token pairs, each prefx sequence is followed by one of two candidate tokens for the next step based on the known (oracle) token pair that the observed representative token belongs to. Unlike conventional beam search, where a fxed number of candidates is retained following each step, we opt for a dynamic approach inspired by nucleus sampling, made possible since the scores for each of the two tokens refect a generative probabilistic process where the relative probability of each interim token sequence on the beam can be estimated and used for dropping highly unlikely sequence prefxes. This means that the number of candidates remaining on the beam varies at each step, adapting to their likelihood and ensuring fexibility in the selection process. We estimate the likelihood of each candidate prefx using a language model.2 After all prefxes on the beam have been scored, we remove the least probable candidates such that the total probability of the remaining candidates exceeds a certain threshold $\\\\pi$ set by computational constraints but maintaining discoverability. Since the probability of a sequence cannot exceed that of its prefx, the process guarantees that complete sequences that are likely are not being discarded before getting the chance to be fully generated. Overall, this process effectively eliminates highly unlikely candidates, dramatically reducing the search space during its application and streamlining the computational efforts.\\n\\nThis process is illustrated in Figure 2. The \\u201coracle\\u201d attacker gains access to the remapped words: $(\\\\,\\\\mathtt{w h a t}\\\\,,\\\\,\\\\mathtt{a}\\\\,)\\\\to\\\\mathtt{a}$ , (nice, is) $\\\\rightarrow$ nice, (day, unicorn) $\\\\rightarrow$ unicorn. In the frst step, two initial candidates (what and $\\\\rightleftharpoons$ ) are generated based on the frst observed token (what). Following the described process, each prefx is evaluated via an LLM to determine its probability, for instance, the probability of what being the frst word is $80\\\\%$ when considering the possible set {[s] what, $[\\\\,S\\\\,]\\\\,\\\\mathrm{~\\\\}\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{\\\\Sigma}}$ . This process is repeated, and the candidates with low probability are removed, such that the total probability of the remaining candidates is above $85\\\\%$ , as indicated by the red boxes. Finally, the probability of the sequence what a beautiful day is the highest, thus the \\u201coracle\\u201d attacker returns it as the inferred original text. We note that the low-frequency and high-frequency mappers, despite their differences in representative token selection, will demonstrate equivalent safeguarding mechanisms against this attacker since the attacker does not factor in the choice of the representative token and examines all potential candidates in its effort to uncover the original text.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.3 Resilience Against Reconstruction Attacks\",\"section_content\":\"In Table 3, we present the outcomes of the attacker\\u2019s endeavors to reveal the original text from the three techniques: 2-Random, 3-Random, and High-freq (equivalent to Low-freq for a knowledgeable attacker). We report the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the correct sequences, the rate of the actual input sequence ranking among the top 5 predictions $(\\\\mathbf{Pr}@5)$ , and the token-level edit distance between the produced top prediction and the original sequence. The relative success of the mappers in thwarting the oracle attacks on the IMDb dataset compared to SST2 can be attributed to the average token sequence length $({\\\\bar{m}})$ , which is 65 and 12, respectively. As sequence length increases, the attacker\\u2019s task of uncovering the original text becomes more challenging.\\nOur results indicate that the na\\u00efve baselines are overly simplistic and allow an easy and straightforward reconstruction, even within a vast search space (although attacker knowledge of the mapping specifcations is required). In cases where performance on the task remains close to that of unmapped text, the recovery price is too high to neglect. Having said that, the computational complexity of applying the na\\u00efve baselines is relatively low, and the greatly reduced active vocabulary brings great savings in parameter budgets, which embedding tables often dominate. In a less powerful attack environment, this would make them an effcient choice for preserving privacy on low-resource devices. We expect future work on more principled many-to-one static mappings would be able to improve both task performance and resilience to attackers, while work on attack strategies can present challenges hitherto unseen.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 STENCIL Privacy Preservation\",\"section_content\":\"In the context of protecting privacy within NLP practices, a widely adopted approach for implementing local differential privacy involves introducing a controlled level of noise into different components of the model, effectively concealing the original input. These components may include sequence embeddings, token embeddings, or the tokens themselves (Mosallanezhad et al., 2019; Feyisetan et al., 2020; Lyu et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022). However, in essence, the success of models in most NLP tasks is primarily attributed to their effective utilization of contextual information. Moreover, our study focuses on token-level privacy preservation, i.e., we assume that the parameters of the LLMs are inaccessible, making the importance of contextual information more pronounced. Therefore, a fundamental limitation associated with incorporating noise is the exclusion of contextual information when defning the noise. This omission may hinder the potential benefts contextual details can offer for maintaining the performance of the downstream tasks.\\nGiven this limitation, we propose a new privacy preservation technique, which we call STENCIL. With this technique, a mapped token in a sequence \\u201cabsorbs\\u201d information from adjacent tokens to form a new context-aware token, effectively concealing the original token while retaining information benefcial for maintaining task performance.\\nIn order to generate the new contextualized token $t_{k}\\\\rightarrow t_{k}^{\\\\prime}$ , we frst retrieve an embedding vector representation of the neighborhood, of size $n+1$ , containing the tokens $t_{i},\\\\forall i\\\\in\\\\{k-n\\/2\\\\dots k+n\\/2\\\\}$ using some embedding lookup table E \\u2208 RV \\u00d7d, which can be trained independently in a preliminary step or obtained from an available model such as the target model itself. We then subject the $n+1$ embedding vector representations to a weighted transformation and incorporate them to form a new \\u201cquasi-embedding\\u201d vector $\\\\begin{array}{r}{\\\\sum_{i=k-n\\/2}^{k+n\\/2}f_{i}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{E}[t_{i}]}\\\\end{array}$ . Finally, we return the token $t_{k}^{\\\\prime}$ that is closest to the quasi-embedding vector in the embedding space, based on cosine-similarity or euclidean distance computation, as an output. To further enhance privacy, we ensure that the new token is different from the original one. Formally, the process can be defned as follows:\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{V}$ is the vocabulary and $f_{i}$ is the weighted transformation function of the tokens such that $\\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{i=k-\\\\frac{n}{2}}^{k+\\\\frac{n}{2}}f_{i}=1$ .\\nThe level of privacy enhancement and its impact on the downstream task by employing the STENCIL method can be managed by adjusting the window size and the properties of the weighted function $f$ . In our study, we use the gaussian smoothing function as the weighted function. Consequently, the standard deviation, $\\\\sigma$ , plays a crucial role in the performance and amount of privacy achieved.\\nAs a baseline for our proposed technique, we adopt Qu et al. (2021)\\u2019s proposed privacypreserving technique. In contrast to our proposed technique, this approach does not consider context but rather incorporates random noise into token embeddings to enhance privacy. The random noise is obtained by multiplying a sample from a Gamma distribution $\\\\Gamma(d,1\\/\\\\eta)$ and a uniform sample from a unit hypersphere, where $\\\\eta$ corresponds to the amount of noise introduced to the original token and $d$ is the dimension of the embedding space.\\nWe note that the most time-intensive operation in both STENCIL and noise-based techniques involves searching for the closest token to the perturbed quasi-embedding vector, while all other operations are negligible in comparison. Overall, the average computational cost per token is 0.005 seconds on two 16-core $3.2~\\\\mathrm{GHz}$ AMD EPYC 7343 Milan processors.\\nTable 4: The best results achieved by the STENCIL mapper and the noise mapper considering the Test and All cases on the SST2, IMDb, and QNLI datasets. $\\\\operatorname{Pr}(\\\\alpha5\\\\$ represents the average token hit managed by the nearestneighbor attacker.\"}\n\n... # only display 8 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

However, this success comes with potential privacy risks, as the models process vast amounts of data that might contain personal or sensitive information and may abuse or leak it. For instance, information can be leaked by model inversion (Li et al., 2017), re-identifcation techniques (Lison et al., 2021; Ben Cheikh Larbi et al., 2023), exploitation of feature memorization within the LLM (Carlini et al., 2021), and more. Offering LLMs as cloud services, such as ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), might also impose potential threats to privacy if the server exhibits a semi-honest stance, actively seeking to glean more insights from the input than is appropriate or by a possible eavesdropper intercepting the input sent to the server.\\n\\nIn order to safeguard privacy, many privacypreserving techniques have been proposed, based on the local differential privacy framework (LDP; Arachchige et al., 2019). In this framework, the user applies a differential privacy mechanism, which can be hosted on a local server, and then sends the privatized data to the remote server. This approach doesn\\u2019t require trust from the remote server, and protects the data against potential eavesdroppers. In general, any privacy mechanism can be applied at one or several components of the LLM pipeline. Figure 1 depicts these components: at the text level (text privatization), after the tokenization process (token privatization), after the initial embedding lookup (token embedding privatization), or after applying several layers of the encoder (sequence embedding privatization).\\nCurrently, most privacy-preserving strategies focus on incorporating noise into sequence embedding vectors. The rationale behind this strategy is to minimize the privacy-preserving technique\\u2019s impact on the downstream task. Specifcally, most systems frst obtain a sequence embedding representation, either by assuming partial access to the remote model (Zhou et al., 2022; Lyu et al., 2020; Qu et al., 2021) or by using a dedicated model to create these embeddings (Li et al., 2018; Coavoux et al., 2018; Mosallanezhad et al., 2019; Plant et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023). Afterwards, random noise is incorporated into the embeddings, thus concealing the original input. However, this approach relies on partial access to the remote model, on the ability to provide input to the remote model in vector form, or on suffcient computational and memory resources on the user\\u2019s end. These are often not the case. In addition, Kugler et al. (2021) showed that publishing a model\\u2019s encoder along with the contextualized embeddings allows an adversary to generate data to train a decoder with a high level of reconstruction accuracy, making these approaches highly susceptible to violation of privacy.\\n\\nWe propose a secure way to use LLMs without assuming access to their parameters. In our framework, both input and output for the privacyproviding mechanism must be given in a token sequence format, eliminating the need to intervene with the LLM\\u2019s pre-training procedure or text processing. We focus on applying privacy preservation techniques at the token level, corresponding to layer (B) in Figure 1.\\nSpecifcally, we propose two privacy-preserving techniques based on manipulating the input token sequence. The frst set of techniques relies on na\\u00efve rules of token substitution. The second is based on leveraging contextual information to strategically replace tokens, aiming to retain as much actionable information as possible for the classifer to minimize the impact on the performance of the downstream task.\\nWe test these techniques both for their impact on the downstream task accuracy and for their resilience against reconstruction attacks. We fnd that replacing tokens based on simple rules is easy for a knowledgeable attacker to reverse, while manipulating tokens based on contextual information can enhance privacy without sacrifcing much of the performance.1\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
