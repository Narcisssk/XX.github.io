{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

As Figure 2 shows, the second part of each template disambiguates which of the two entities the pronoun uniquely refers to, similar to Winograd schemas (Levesque et al., 2012). Changing the pronoun (e.g., from his to her) maintains the coreference, allowing us to measure whether coreference resolution systems are worse at resolving certain pronouns to certain entities. Rudinger et al. (2018) use the gendered associations of these pronouns to show that gender bias affects coreference resolution performance.\\nThe entities consist of 60 occupation-participant pairs (e.g., accountant is paired with taxpayer). A pair of templates is created for each occupationparticipant pair, resulting in a total of 120 unique templates. The template pairs are designed to be parallel until the pronoun, such that only the ending can be used to disambiguate how to resolve the pronoun: it should resolve to the occupation in one template, and to the participant in the other. Each template can be instantiated with three pronoun sets (he, she, and singular they), for a total of $120\\\\mathrm{~x~}3=360$ sentences for evaluation.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Although Winogender Schemas are established in the coreference resolution literature, we fnd issues with the dataset that compromise its use for reliable evaluation (see Figure 1 for examples).

To enable more granular evaluation, we balance this distribution in WINOPRON.\\nConsistency Fixes Winograd-like schemas have strict structural constraints so that models cannot infate performance through heuristics. However, when analyzing Winogender Schemas, we found constraint violations, e.g., non-parallel paired templates. We fxed these along with typographical errors to ensure robust and reliable evaluation.\\nSupport for All English Pronouns For a controlled evaluation comparing pronouns, it is common to use templates that only vary the pronoun. However, $17\\\\%$ of Winogender Schemas must be modifed to work with singular they due to its different verbal agreement (\\u201che was\\u201d but \\u201cthey were\\u201d). To ensure a fair comparison between pronouns, we modify these templates to work with any pronouns.\\nSingle-Entity Versions When evaluating large language models on coreference resolution when they have not explicitly been trained for it, poor performance could mean that the model simply cannot perform the task (with a given prompt). In its current form, Winogender Schemas do not allow us to disentangle why bad model performance is bad. In WINOPRON, we create single-entity sentences that are parallel to the traditional, more complex double-entity sentences, for a simple setting to test this, and a useful baseline for all systems.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Two authors with linguistic training iteratively created sentence templates until we reached consensus on their grammaticality and correct, unique coreferences. We found template construction to be particularly challenging and time-consuming, due to ambiguity and verbal constraints.\\nAmbiguity Our biggest source of ambiguity during template creation was singular they, as they is also a third person plural pronoun. For example, if an advisor and student were meeting to discuss their future, this could potentially refer to their future together. This problem applied across grammatical cases. In addition, possessive sentences were potentially ambiguous across all pronoun series; when discussing a doctor and a patient and someone\\u2019s diagnosis, this could be the doctor\\u2019s diagnosis (i.e., the diagnosis made by the doctor), or the patient\\u2019s diagnosis (i.e., the diagnosis the patient received). All ambiguous templates were discarded and subsequently reworked.\\nVerbal Constraints The structural constraint of template pairs being identical until the pronoun led to some diffculties in fnding appropriate (logically and semantically plausible) endings for the two sentences, particularly with accusative pronouns. With nominative pronouns, we had to ensure we used verbs in the past tense and avoid was\\/were, so that our templates could be used with both he\\/she\\/xe and singular they. It was also sometimes diffcult to create single-entity sentences that were semantically close to the double-entity versions because the latter only made sense with two entities (e.g., \\u201cX gave Y something\\u201d).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"As WINOPRON templates have structural constraints that can be programmatically validated, we wrote automatic checks for these. In addition, we performed human annotation of the sentences for grammaticality, and unique, correct coreferences.\\n\\nAutomatic Checks We automatically checked our data for completeness frst, i.e., that every occupation-participant pair had sentence templates for nominative, accusative, and possessive pronouns. We then automatically checked structural constraints, e.g., that a pair of templates must always be identical until the pronoun slot, and that no additional pronouns appeared in the sentence.\\nHuman Annotation Both authors who created the schemas systematically annotated them, rating $100\\\\%$ of the fnal instances as grammatical and $100\\\\%$ of them as having unique, correct coreferences. We confrmed the uniqueness of coreferences by marking each data instance as coreferring with the appropriate antecedent and not coreferring with the other antecedent. An additional annotator independently verifed the fnal templates, rating $100\\\\%$ of them as grammatical, and $98.2\\\\%$ as having unique, correct coreferences.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To demonstrate the effects of our changes, we evaluate performance and consistency on WINOPRON with a range of models with different levels of training for coreference resolution.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"LingMess (Otmazgin et al., 2023) is a state-ofthe-art, linguistically motivated, mixture-of-experts system for coreference resolution.\\nCAW-coref (D\\u2019Oosterlinck et al., 2023) is a stateof-the-art word-level coreference resolution system based on an encoder-only model.\\nSpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2020) is an encoder-only language model pre-trained with a span prediction objective and further enhanced for coreference resolution with fne-tuning data.

Then we use WINOPRON to investigate differences across case (which we have balanced for) and pronoun sets (which can now be evenly compared). Additional results are in Appendix E.\\nWINOPRON is harder than Winogender Schemas. As Table 2 shows, all the systems we evaluate perform worse on WINOPRON, with F1 dropping on average by 10 percentage points compared to Winogender Schemas. Patterns of performance across models are similar between Winogender Schemas and WINOPRON, with similar scaling behaviour for both SpanBERT and FLAN-T5. Notably, scale seems to supercede supervision, as the largest FLAN-T5 models perform the best overall. Smaller FLAN-T5 models perform at chance level, which is likely a refection of the \\u201cdemand gap\\u201d induced through prompting (Hu and Frank, 2024).\\n\\nAccusative pronouns are harder. When model accuracy is split by grammatical case and pronoun series, we see that all models struggle with accusative pronouns. In general, systems perform best at resolving nominative pronouns, with a slight decrease for possessive pronouns and a large drop for accusative pronouns, as seen in Figure 3. This fnding holds even for the best performing models on WINOPRON, FLAN-T5-xl and FLANT5-xxl, where accuracy with accusative pronouns $(81.9\\\\%$ and $78.6\\\\%$ is much lower than with nominative $(94.3\\\\%$ and $96.3\\\\%$ ) or possessive ${}89.3\\\\%$ and $90.0\\\\%$ ) pronouns. We hypothesize that the performance gap for accusative pronouns is partially an effect of frequency; him tokens appear roughly half as often in large pre-training corpora as he and his tokens (Elazar et al., 2024).\\nPerformance with singular they and neopronouns is bimodal. For the supervised coreference resolution systems (LingMess and CAWcoref), performance with singular they is close to chance, and performance with the neopronoun $x e$ is far below chance, despite good performance with he\\/him\\/his and she\\/her\\/her. SpanBERT performance also shows a gap between singular they and neopronoun performance compared to data-rich pronouns, although the gap is much smaller. These fndings mirror those of Cao and Daum\\u00e9 III (2020); Lauscher et al. (2022) and Gautam et al. (2024a). However, in contrast to Gautam et al.\\u2019s (2024a) fndings with encoder-only and decoder-only models, there is no large difference in accuracy across pronoun sets with FLAN-T5 models. As FLAN-T5 has been instruction fne-tuned for the task of coreference resolution but not pronoun fdelity (Chung et al., 2024), this could explain the model\\u2019s ability to generalize to new pronouns in our setting.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
