{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Instead, we frst randomly selected 25 of the 50 total instructions. Then for each instruction, we produced 15 pairs of randomly sampled model outputs and created another 15 pairs by reversing their order (for ORDER BIAS) or switching the bias-induced sentence between A or B (for BANDWAGON EFFECT and ATTENTIONAL BIAS). This results in 30 pairs (with 15 unique model pairs) in total for each instruction and fnally totals 750 pairs for all 25 instructions. Note that the sample size ensured a $95\\\\%$ confdence level with a $5\\\\%$ margin of error for a population size of 5250.\\nUpon collecting all annotations for each bias, we calculated the average IAA using the RBO for each bias. Each instruction consisted of uniquely (but randomly) sampled model pairs, with some models appearing multiple times. Hence, we normalized the rank of each model in the sampled pairs by calculating the ratio of the model\\u2019s \\u201cwin\\u201d to its total appearances. With this data, we re-ranked each model in the sampled pairs per instruction. Afterward, we computed the mean RBO among the ranked model lists from each group of three AMT workers per instruction.

(2010), we set the value of $p$ so that approximately $86\\\\%$ of the weight is concentrated on the frst $d$ ranks, where $d\\\\,=\\\\,5$ in our case. The weight distribution over these top $d$ ranks can be determined using Equation 2. This means that the value of Equation (2) given $d=5$ should be 0.86.

Following these steps, we aggregated the bias proportions across all annotators, showing the degrees of impact of bias on human preference in pairwise selections. For SALIENCE BIAS, we leveraged annotations from ORDER BIAS experiments and calculated proportions for shorter and longer preferred responses.\\nWe then reported the preference with a higher average proportion that was computed all across annotators, indicating whether humans were more infuenced by shorter or longer length bias.\"}\n\nIn total, 4 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

We\\npresent the hyperparameters in Appendix B.2.\\nTask setup. Our experiments mainly consist of instruction tuining, math finetuning, and natural\\nlanguage understanding.\\n1. Instruction tuning. We finetune the Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models on Alpaca-\\nGPT4 dataset [46] for 3 epochs. This dataset consists of 52k instruction-following data\\ngenerated by GPT-4, using prompts from the Alpaca dataset [53]. The finetuned model\\nis then evaluated using the MT-bench [68] with the \\\"gpt-4\\\" API to test its downstream\\nperformance.\\n2. Math finetuning. We finetune the Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B models on MathInstruct\\ndataset [61] for 3 epochs, which contains 260K samples from 13 math related datasets. The\\nmodel is then evaluated on 4 in-domain benchmarks [12, 19, 31, 40] and 2 out-of-domain\\nbenchmarks [70, 18] using zero-shot prompt. Our evaluation implementation is based on\\nthe released code2 of [61].\\n3. SuperGLUE. we finetune the RoBERTa-large model [32] with 355 million parameters on\\nthe SuperGLUE benchmark [56], and evaluate the performance of the finetuned model using\\nthe test dataset. Since the label of the original test dataset is not revealed, we randomly\\nsplit the \\\"dev\\\" dataset into validation and test dataset; see Table 7. We focus on 6 tasks\\nof the SuperGLUE benchmark, including BoolQ, COPA, WSC, RTE, MultiRC, and WiC.\\nSince the classification modules of RoBERTa-large are randomly initialized, we set these\\nclassification modules to be trainable for all methods.\\nTask\\nTrain\\nValidation\\nTest\\nBoolQ\\n9427\\n1270\\n2000\\nCOPA\\n400\\n30\\n70\\nMultiRC\\n5100\\n453\\n500\\nRTE\\n2500\\n128\\n150\\nWiC\\n6000\\n238\\n400\\nWSC\\n554\\n44\\n60\\nTable 7: Data split for the SuperGLUE experiment. The original \\\"dev\\\" dataset is randomly splitted\\ninto validation and test datasets.\\nSetup for different finetuning methods. For BAdam, we use consecutive module-based block\\npartition represented by transformer layers, resulting in the number of blocks D = 32 for the\\nLlama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models, D = 80 for the Llama 3-70B model, and D = 26 for the\\nRoBERTa-large model. The ordering strategy in the partition \\u03c0 of BAdam is random reshuffling. For\\nGalore, LoRA, and BAdam, we train all the transformer layers while freezing the language modeling\\nhead and the embedding layers. For Adam and LOMO, we set all modules in transformer layers to\\nbe trainable. We adopt the setup in Galore\\u2019s paper and apply pure BF16 and 8-bits Adam for all\\nGalore\\u2019s experiments. We apply pure BF16 precision training for LOMO, as it does not support mixed\\nprecision training. Since LOMO does not support gradient accumulation, its batch size is smaller\\nthan the other approaches (consequently, it runs more steps) to ensure aligned memory consumption;\\nsee Appendix B.2 for more detail.\\nAdditional implementation details.\\n\\u2022 All the experiments in Section 3.1 are conducted using a single RTX3090-24GB. We use\\n4\\u00d7A100-80GB GPUs to finetune the Llama 3-70B model using LoRA and BAdam.\\n2https:\\/\\/github.com\\/TIGER-AI-Lab\\/MAmmoTH\\n18\\n\\u2022 For all the experiments of finetuning Llama models, we apply the gradient checkpointing\\ntechnique [11] to reduce the memory cost of storing activations for all methods. In particular,\\nwe checkpoint the input of each transformer layer and re-forward to calculate the layer\\u2019s\\nactivations during the backward phase.\\n\\u2022 The experiments on finetuning Llama models are implemented using Llama-Factory [69].\\nThe SuperGLUE experiments are based on the implementation of jiant [47].\\nB.2\\nHyperparameters\\nWe summarize the choices of hyperparameters for SuperGLUE, instruction tuning, and math finetun-\\ning in Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10, respectively. Some discussions follow:\\n\\u2022 BAdam introduces only one additional hyperparameter compared to Adam, namely, K in\\nAlgorithm 1. One natural choice is K =\\nn\\nBD, where n is the number of training data points,\\nB is the effective batch size, and D is the number of blocks in BAdam. We round\\nn\\nBD to the\\nnearest integer if it is a fractional. Such a setting ensures that after one block-epoch, all the\\nn training data points are equally distributed to the D blocks for training. On another front,\\ntoo small K may result in insufficient Adam steps, while too large K may over-optimize\\none block before moving to others. Therefore, one possible choice is\\nK = min\\nn\\nmax\\nn n\\nBD, 50\\no\\n, 100\\no\\n.\\n(7)\\nThe suggested selection is merely a guideline.

Compared to PACSUM (Zheng and Lapata, 2019), the only difference is that HIPORANK incorporates section structural information for degree centrality calculation.

The results show that the distribution of ground truth sentences in academic papers is more even. In other words, academic papers have less positional bias than news articles.\\nWe also notice that the neural extractive models tend to outperform the neural abstractive methods in general, possibly because the extended context is more challenging for generative models during decoding. ExtSum-LG (Xiao and Carenini, 2019) is a benchmarked extractive method with section information by incorporating both the global context of the whole document and the local context within the current topic.

All the measurements in this subsection are based on finetuning\\nthe Llama 3-8B model on Alpaca-GPT4 dataset [46] using a single RTX3090-24GB GPU.\\nMemory consumption. We report the actual memory consumption of BAdam and the baseline\\napproaches in Table 2 for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model, in which the memory consumption of\\nAdam is estimated rather than tested. This result indicates that all of LOMO, LoRA (with a reasonable\\nrank), and BAdam can finetune the Llama 3-8B model using a single RTX3090. It can be observed\\nthat all the methods have nearly the same memory cost for storing the model parameters, while\\nLoRA requires slightly more memory due to its low-rank adapters. Furthermore, LOMO, LoRA,\\nand BAdam significantly reduce memory consumption regarding the storage of the gradient and\\noptimizer states compared to Adam. Moreover, it is easy to see that the total memory consumption\\n(the last column of Table 2) is higher than the sum of the listed quantities. The additional memory\\ncosts arise from storing activations and training data, pre-allocated memory caches by PyTorch, and\\nother buffers for intermediate computing results. Indeed, our tests show that BAdam can successfully\\nfinetune the Llama 3-8B model with input sequences of length 1024 using a batch size of 2, or input\\nsequences of length 2048 using a batch size of 1, with a single RTX3090-24GB GPU.\\nWall-clock running time comparison. We conduct experiments on finetuning the Llama 3-8B\\nmodel for 3 epochs with each method and report the averaged wall-clock time per epoch; see Table 3.\\nThe forward time for three approaches are rather close. The slightly higher time cost for LOMO\\nand LoRA attributes to additional operations for registering activations and the calculation of the\\nlow-rank adapters, respectively. Regarding backward time, BAdam reduces the time cost by nearly\\nhalf compared to LoRA and LOMO, supporting the analysis in Section 2.2.2.

Hence, we omit this outlier.\\nSome remarks and observations on Table 5 are in order. 1) Using 1e-5 as the initial learning rate, the\\naverage MT-bench score over 3 epochs achieved by BAdam surpasses that of LoRA by a magnitude\\nof 0.42 for instruction-tuning the Llama 2-7B model. Regarding instruction-tuning the Llama 3-8B\\nmodel using an initial learning rate of 1e-6, the average score returned by BAdam outperforms that\\nof LoRA by a magnitude of 0.38. 2) In most cases, BAdam can beat LoRA and Galore, albeit\\nsometimes slightly, across the two learning rate settings and when evaluating checkpoints from\\ndifferent epochs for both the Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models. This underscores the promising\\nperformance of our proposed method. 3) BAdam is on par with the performance of Adam for the\\nLlama 2-7B model and outperforms Adam for the Llama 3-8B model, partly illustrating the power of\\nthe BCD optimization scheme in LLM finetuning. It is worth noting that BAdam is both memory\\nand running time efficient. In terms of memory usage, it requires only a single RTX3090-24GB GPU\\nfor finetuning the Llama 3-8B model, while Adam needs multiple A100-80GB GPUs.\\n8\\nModel: Llama 3-8B\\nMethod\\nGSM8K\\nAqua\\nMMLU-Math\\nSAT-Math\\nMATH\\nNumGLUE\\nAverage\\nBase model\\n25.9\\n22.8\\n33.7\\n39.5\\n12.8\\n34.5\\n28.2\\nAdam\\n54.5\\n40.5\\n44.3\\n51.4\\n18.4\\n55.4\\n44.1\\nLOMO\\n32.1\\n28.0\\n40.0\\n39.5\\n13.1\\n37.1\\n31.6\\nLoRA\\n47.5\\n44.9\\n45.3\\n50.9\\n14.5\\n56.9\\n43.3\\nGalore\\n33.1\\n37.4\\n41.2\\n42.7\\n15.0\\n36.9\\n34.4\\nBAdam\\n48.1\\n42.5\\n50.5\\n56.8\\n15.7\\n53.0\\n44.4\\nModel: Llama 3-70B\\nMethod\\nGSM8K\\nAqua\\nMMLU-Math\\nSAT-Math\\nMATH\\nNumGLUE\\nAverage\\nBase model\\n52.4\\n46.5\\n52.2\\n58.2\\n21.2\\n37.9\\n44.7\\nLoRA\\n73.3\\n59.5\\n58.3\\n64.1\\n34.2\\n64.8\\n59.0\\nBAdam\\n78.8\\n63.4\\n64.2\\n76.4\\n26.2\\n67.3\\n62.7\\nTable 6: Zero-shot math benchmark scores of the finetuned Llama 3-8B and Llama 3-70B on\\nMathInstruct dataset by different methods.\\nMath benchmarks.

Then, we compare the performance of BAdam, BSGD and their\\nfull counterparts, i.e., Adam and SGD, to illustrate the power of BCD in LLMs finetuing.\\nOptimization. In the left and middle figures of Figure 3, we display the training loss of BAdam,\\nBSGD, and their full counterparts. It can be observed that BCD variants converge slightly slower but\\nsoon exhibit similar convergence behavior in terms of running time compared to their full counterparts.\\nIt is worth mentioning that, unlike the full counterparts, BCD only updates one block of parameters\\nper data batch, demonstrating the strong optimization ability of BCD for LLMs finetuning.\\nDownstream performance. In the right table of Figure 3, we test the MT-bench scores of the four\\nmethods. It is quite interesting to see that BSGD significantly outperforms SGD (almost as good as\\nBAdam), even though they have almost the same optimization convergence behavior. We suspect that\\nthe superiority of the BCD variants over their full counterparts possibly stems from the fact that BCD\\nuses each data batch to update only one block of parameters, thereby better preserving the general\\nknowledge of the pretrained model during finetuning. These improved downstream performance of\\nBCD compared to their full counterparts further illustrate its suitability for LLM finetuning.\\n9\\n3.5\\nAdditional Experiment Results\\nWe provide more experiment results in Appendix C. Here are the summarized results: 1) In Ap-\\npendix C.1, we conduct an ablation study on the ordering scheme of the partition \\u03c0 in BAdam,\\nconsidering random reshuffling, ascending, and descending orders. In terms of convergence behavior,\\nthese three choices are competitive. We also provide an ablation study on the hyperparameter K in\\nBAdam, with K being chosen from {10, 50, 100, 200}. The results indicate that these four choices\\nof K perform similarly in terms of convergence behavior. However, we observe that the convergence\\nspeed of choosing different K can vary across different models. We refer to Appendix B.2 for a\\ndetailed discussion on the selection of K. 2) In Appendix C.2, we examine BAdam\\u2019s capability in\\nclassification tasks by training RoBERTa-large on SuperGLUE benchmarks. The results show that\\nBAdam can achieve similar average scores as Adam. 3) In Appendix C.3, we conduct a preliminary\\ncontinue pretraining (CPT) experiment. We apply BAdam to train the Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct model\\non the StarCoder-Python dataset [28] for about 1 epoch. The result shows that BAdam can effectively\\ndecrease the CPT loss, making it a strong candidate for CPT tasks when GPU memory is limited. 4)\\nWe display the memory consumption and running time costs for finetuning the Llama 2-7B model in\\nAppendix C.4, which match the results for finetuning the Llama 3-8B model presented in Section 3.1.\\nIn summary, our experiment results in Section 3 demonstrate that BAdam has the potential to serve as\\na competitive optimization method for finetuning LLMs when the GPU memory is limited, compared\\nto state-of-the-art memory efficient methods such as LoRA.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Methods\",\"section_content\":\"Methods\\n3.1\\nProblem Definition\\nIn the scientific domain, considering the causal factors x \\u2208X and the observed physical outcome\\ny \\u2208Y, there are two major problems to be solved: the forward simulation of X \\u2192Y, and the inverse\\ndesign of Y \\u2192X. The forward simulation is definite and can be obtained by solving the mathematical\\nequations involved inside the physical system. However, the inverse design is nontrivial because there\\nis no such equation that describes the inverse relationship. In addition, the one-to-many mapping\\nissue, meaning multiple different x can lead to similar y, also complicates this problem.\\nFor multilayer structures, the causal factors x refer to the multilayer structure and include the material\\ncomposition m = [m1, m2, . . . , mN] and layer thicknesses t = [t1, t2, . . . , tN], where N denotes\\nthe number of layers. Usually, material mi is a discrete variable, and ti is a continuous variable. On\\nthe other hand, y refers to the optical responses that we hope to design, e.g., spectrum or colors,\\nand can be represented as a vector. TMM [7] can finish the forward prediction and calculate the\\nspectrum y for a given x by solving equations relating to the wave fields at the boundaries of each\\nlayer. However, TMM does not inherently support the reverse computation of deriving x from a given\\ny. In OptoGPT, the model treats the design parameters of x = {[m1, m2, . . . , mN], [t1, t2, . . . , tN]}\\nas a sequence of x = {[m1, t1], [m2, t2], . . . , [mN, tN]} and uses sequential generation to design\\nmultilayer structures layer-by-layer when given input y as a condition. In their consideration, at\\neach layer, there are 18 different types of materials and 50 different thicknesses discretized by 10nm\\nranging from 10nm to 500nm. The maximum number of layers is 20. Therefore, the size of the\\n3\\nmultilayer structures design space extends to (18 \\u221750)20 \\u223c1059. For optical responses of y, they are\\nconsidering reflection and transmission spectrum among 400-1100nm with 10nm gap.\\nThe dataset generation in OptoGPT is a two-step random sampling process. They first randomly\\ngenerate 10M different structures by uniformly sampling the material and thickness at each layer,\\nthen use TMM to simulate and obtain their spectrum, making the dataset consist of (x, y) pairs of\\nstructures and spectrum. This synthetic dataset is then used to train OptoGPT to learn the inverse\\nmapping from desired spectral outcomes back to structural designs. As mentioned above, this would\\nlead to the issue of OOD and causes problems when designing for some practical applications. This\\nissue is non-trivial as we cannot add infinite data in the sampling process due to computational limit,\\nand many traditional methods in CV and NLP such as in-context learning [26] cannot be applied as we\\nhave no plausible assumptions on the distribution of our sampled region with the actual distribution\\nof the space.\\n3.2\\nSelf-Improving Data Augmentation\\nNeural networks have shown some limited extrapolation ability [27]. This, however, can be utilized\\nto provide a starting point when augmenting training data. Here is the intuition: we can gradually\\nexplore and extend the data space out of the original scope through perturbations guided by physical\\nsimulators and finally reach the OOD region. We illustrate this idea in Figure 2a. The green region\\nrefers to the space of y corresponding to the random sampling in the space of x. The red region is the\\nOOD region that is not sampled or under-sampled in the space of y. Notice that each point denotes a\\ndifferent optical response, namely, a different inverse design task. After training on the green region,\\nwe expect that the neural networks have some extrapolation ability to expand the identifiable region\\nto the blue region, which is the region that is slightly outside of the training dataset distribution.\\nFigure 2: Illustration of the self-improving data augmentation. (a) Visualization of the self-improving\\nin the space of optical responses y. (b) Diagram of our workflow: We input a synthetic OOD dataset\\nand ask the model to generate the structure design. Then using perturbation method, we further\\nexplore beyond the scope of the original model, and construct a small augmented dataset with better\\ndata representation of the OOD region to finetune the model.\\nTo reach the blue region, we query our model with some practical and difficult design targets that are\\noutside of the training dataset and ask our model to give designs, which will be used as a starting\\npoint to approach the red region. Next, we will perturb inside the structure space of x. To guarantee\\nthat we are approaching the red region in the response space of y, we use GA to perturb the materials\\nand PSO to perturb the thickness with the goal of minimizing the difference in the optical responses.\\nHowever, instead of running the complete optimization which requires thousands of iteration steps,\\nwe only run limited optimization steps (e.g., 5 iterations) to maintain small perturbation and fast speed.\\nAfter that, we use TMM to obtain the simulated optical responses for these perturbated structures\\nand calculate their spectrum MSE compared to the target spectrum. We only keep these structures\\nwith a lower spectrum MSE than the previous model and collect them to create a new dataset for\\nfinetuning. We can iterate this process several times to gradually push the model to approach the OOD\\nregion and achieve better performance. Figure 2b shows the complete pipeline of self-improving data\\naugmentation. We also provide a pseudo algorithm in Algorithm 1.\\n4\\nAlgorithm 1 Self-Improving Data Augmentation\\n1: Construct a dataset S with optical responses in the OOD region.\\n2: Query the OptoGPT model with S and generate a set of structures X using auto-regressive\\ndecoding method D, e.g., greedy decoding, Top-KP sampling [28, 29], or beam search.\\n3: Apply perturbation method GA_PSO on X to create multiple new samples \\u02c6\\nX.\\n4: Use TMM to evaluate the performance of \\u02c6\\nX and select those with improved performance to form\\na new augmented dataset X\\u2032.\\n5: Finetune OptoGPT on this augmented dataset X\\u2032.\\n6: Repeat step 2-5 until no significant improvement on model performance.\\n3.3\\nPerturbation Method\\nThe core of our method is the perturbation, which enables our model to effectively explore beyond\\nthe current scope and move to the desired OOD region. Therefore, the generated structures of X\\nshould be as diverse as possible, giving a wide range of distinct starting point so that we can better\\nexplore beyond the original scope. Fortunately, for GPT-type models, this can be easily achieved\\nusing probabilistic decoding methods such as top-k [28] or top-p sampling [29], where different\\nsampling seeds would lead to different outputs.\\nOnce we obtain initial structures from OptoGPT, the next step is to perturb these structures towards the\\nOOD region. Multilayer structures have two different sets of parameters: the material and thickness.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-step perturbation approach called GA_PSO to first perturb the material\\nusing GA, then perturb thickness using PSO. During each perturbation, the structures are optimized\\nand modified with the goal of decreasing the difference between simulated optical responses and\\ntarget responses. However, different from general optimization process which takes thousands or\\nmore iterations, we terminate the optimization process within few iterations of the workflow. This is\\nbecause we only want to introduce a small perturbation to the training dataset for a better learning.\\nIn addition, running more iterations on each individual sample from this generated structures can\\ntake a long time. Early termination in the optimization process can provide a good balance between\\nperformance and efficiency. We also provide a pseudo algorithm for GA_PSO in Algorithm 2.\\nAlgorithm 2 GA_PSO Perturbation Method\\n1: For each individual structure in the generated structure X, fix its thickness and apply the Genetic\\nAlgorithm (GA) to perturb the materials with the following strategies:\\n\\u2022 Mutation: Divide materials into five different types based on the refractive index: high,\\nmedium, and low refractive index dielectric material, metal, and semiconductor materials.\\nFor each layer, perform material mutations with probabilities: 70% within the same group,\\n20% switch to a different group, and 10% remain unchanged.\\n\\u2022 Crossover: Select two structures, and create a new structure by concatenating the first half\\nfrom the first structure and the second half from the second structure.\\n2: For each individual structure in the generated structure X after doing material perturbation, fix its\\nmaterial and apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on the thickness. Since we only conduct\\nseveral iterations for PSO, we save all these intermediate structures among the optimization\\ntrajectory for next step.\\nNotice here we perturb the material and thickness separately using different optimization methods.\\nThere are several considerations: (1) The space of the combination of material and thickness is huge,\\nand the perturbation method needs to achieve progress in a controllable time. Since genetic algorithm\\nis time-consuming, separating the thickness optimization for PSO will yield better efficiency. (2)\\nConducting material permutation requires integrating prior knowledge in material design, in which\\nhere we separate the materials in groups. This is only achievable by Genetic Algorithm in mutation\\nphase since it can deal with discrete variables.\\n5\\n4\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.4 Compared Methods\",\"section_content\":\"We compare our methods with the following three types of previous state-of-the-art methods:\\nDiscriminative methods.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.4.2 Multi-view Results Aggregation\",\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2 Low-resource Results\",\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities. MVP (transfer) trained with simple tasks (TASD and ASTE here) with adequate data can be easily transferred to tough tasks (ASQP and ACOS here) when the dataset sizes are small, and vice versa.\\nTable 4: Ablation of constrained decoding and effect of aggregation strategy on ASTE (L14) and ASQP (R15). \\u201cw\\/o cd\\u201d discards the constrained decoding during inference.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term. The detailed\\nresults are presented in Figure 9.\\nOur findings reveal that increasing the number of diffusion steps primarily enhances behavior en-\\ntropy, signifying an improvement in the model\\u2019s capacity to capture multi-modalities. However,\\nfor BeT and VAE-ACT, we did not observe a consistent trend indicating a correlation between the\\nparameters and success rate or entropy.\\nInference Time Comparison.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.4.2 Multi-view Results Aggregation\",\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2 Low-resource Results\",\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities. MVP (transfer) trained with simple tasks (TASD and ASTE here) with adequate data can be easily transferred to tough tasks (ASQP and ACOS here) when the dataset sizes are small, and vice versa.\\nTable 4: Ablation of constrained decoding and effect of aggregation strategy on ASTE (L14) and ASQP (R15). \\u201cw\\/o cd\\u201d discards the constrained decoding during inference.

Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.4.2 Multi-view Results Aggregation\",\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Additional Task Details\",\"section_content\":\"ADDITIONAL TASK DETAILS\\nWe provide additional visualizations and more detailed task descriptions.\\nAvoiding\\nrr-gg\\nrg-gr\\ngr-rg\\ngg-rr\\nPushing\\nstart\\nstart\\npush from inside\\npush from outside\\nstart\\npush blue box\\npush 2 red boxes\\npush 2 blue boxes\\npick green cube\\npick red cube\\ng-r-b\\nr-b-g\\nStacking\\nAligning\\nSorting\\nFigure 3: D3IL Visualizations.

Because of their ease of fabrication, they have been widely used for a variety of\\nindustrial applications including absorber [1], optical filters [2], structural color [3, 4], and distributed\\nBragg reflectors (DBR) [5, 6]. The different optical properties of the material (e.g., refractive\\nindex) and different thickness at each layer will combine together to determine the overall optical\\nbehavior of the stack, enabling precise control over light transmission, reflection, and absorption.\\nThe forward process of obtaining such responses for a specific structure can be easily calculated\\nthrough electromagnetic simulation tools such as Transfer Matrix Methods (TMM) [7]. However,\\nthe inverse process is nontrivial, where one needs to identify a suitable structure to satisfy desired\\noptical responses. For a long time, iterative optimization-based methods have been widely used\\n*Correspondence to: taigaom@umich.edu and guo@umich.edu.\\n\\u2020Work done while at University of Michigan, currently at Visa Research, Austin, TX 78759, USA.\\nFoundation Models for Science Workshop,38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS\\n2024).\\nto design these multilayer structures, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [8, 9], Needle\\nOptimization [10] and Genetic Algorithm [11, 12]. However, these methods are often time-consuming\\nand task-specific, making them unsuitable for complex and practical design scenarios.\\nIn recent years, advances in deep learning techniques have made it possible to inverse design diverse\\nmultilayer structures after training a neural network. Especially, with the development of a new\\nfoundation model based OptoGPT [13], researchers are able to design any type of spectrum and\\nobtain multiple different structures within 0.1 second, which significantly shortens the design time\\nwhile still achieving improved design accuracy. In OptoGPT, the authors reformulate the multilayer\\nstructure design as a sequence generation task conditioned on an input optical spectrum, where each\\ngenerated token denotes both material and thickness information at each layer, and use a decoder-only\\ntransformer architecture for the structure generation. In order to train OptoGPT, they generate a large\\ntraining dataset comprising 10M pairs of multilayer structures and simulated optical responses, i.e.,\\nthe reflection and transmission spectrum. During dataset generation, they first randomly sample 10M\\nstructures from a large potential design space with 1059 different structures, then use the TMM to\\nsimulate and obtain corresponding optical responses.\\nHowever, random sampling inside the large space of multilayer structures does not guarantee a\\nsimilar distribution inside the space of optical responses. This is because the forward mapping from\\nmultilayer structures to optical responses is non-uniform (originated from solving the non-linear\\nequations in TMM).

In OptoGPT, the authors reformulate the multilayer\\nstructure design as a sequence generation task conditioned on an input optical spectrum, where each\\ngenerated token denotes both material and thickness information at each layer, and use a decoder-only\\ntransformer architecture for the structure generation. In order to train OptoGPT, they generate a large\\ntraining dataset comprising 10M pairs of multilayer structures and simulated optical responses, i.e.,\\nthe reflection and transmission spectrum. During dataset generation, they first randomly sample 10M\\nstructures from a large potential design space with 1059 different structures, then use the TMM to\\nsimulate and obtain corresponding optical responses.\\nHowever, random sampling inside the large space of multilayer structures does not guarantee a\\nsimilar distribution inside the space of optical responses.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Limitations, discussion, and conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"Limitations, discussion, and conclusion\\n5.1\\nSafety concerns related to self-recognizing LLMs\\nSelf-recognition is a general ability that can potentially affect many multi-LLM interactions. In this\\npaper, we focus on self-preference as the downstream property and provide initial evidence towards\\ncausation, but we see evidence of generalization to additional downstream properties. In particular,\\nby evaluating LLMs on datasets with distinct construction processes, we observe that self-recognition\\nfine-tuning generalizes across the two datasets and that our hypothesis holds out-of-distribution.\\nMotivated by these results, we discuss safety risks caused by self-recognition and its causal effect on\\nvarious biases.\\nBiased self-evaluation In model-based benchmarks, a model\\u2019s rating can be inflated simply because\\nit is similar to the evaluator model. The bias is also a risk for methods designed for safety and\\nalignment, such as reward modeling (Leike et al., 2018; Stiennon et al., 2020) and constitutional\\nAI (Bai et al., 2022), for similar reasons: the reward model gives higher scores to models similar to\\n8\\nitself, leading to weaker oversight and supervision. The bias can be amplified if the model is updated\\nwith feedback or training signal generated by itself Pan et al. (2024); Xu et al. (2024).\\nOur work provides a basis for countermeasures against self-preference. If future evaluation confirms\\nself-preference to be as pervasive as other biases such as ordering bias, countermeasures such as\\nauthorship obfuscation should be incorporated into standard prompting practice.\\nWhite-box adversarial attacks for free and unbounded reward hacking In an adversarial setting\\n(see Raina et al. (2024) for example), an LLM defender is no longer protected by black-box access\\nif the adversary LLM recognizes their similarities. In the worst case scenario where the adversary\\nuses the same LLM as the defender, the adversary can gain unbounded access to the defender. A\\nsimilar concern applies to the non-adversarial setting, where similar LLMs are use as both optimizer\\nand reward model, as well: the strength of potential reward hacking is unbounded even if the two\\nLLMs only communicate textually. For example, the optimizer can ignore the feedback provided\\nby the reward model, and instead directly optimize for the shared, unaligned representation of the\\nhuman-specified objectives.\\n5.2\\nLimitations and future work\\nControlling for ground-truth generation quality. Self-preference is justified if the LLM\\u2019s gener-\\nation actually is higher in quality. From a safety perspective, our interest is when an LLM prefers\\nits own outputs that are of equal or worse quality than the alternative. This requires controlling for\\ngeneration quality using ground-truth annotation when measuring self-preference. Our existing results\\nprovide indirect evidence for disproportionate self-preference: the sum of mutual self-preference\\nscores for a pair of LLMs exceeds 1, so for at least a portion of the dataset they each prefer themselves.\\nExample-level causal hypothesis. Our central hypothesis can be interpreted on either the example\\nor capability level. We focus on the capability level: high self-recognition capability causes LLMs to\\nshow stronger self-preference. The example level counterpart would be: an LLM shows preference\\ntowards a piece of text because it recognizes the text as its own generation, an hypothesis of interest\\nto interpretability. Although we observe on the correlation of the two properties on the confidence of\\nindividual predictions, our control experiments cannot further the causal argument on the example\\nlevel. One approach to gather evidence for the example-level causal hypothesis is to perturb or\\nparaphrase LLM-generated text to inhibit self-recognition and measure self-preference.\\nLimited number of experiment conditions. We focus on text summarization as a realistic problem\\nwith existing high quality data that have seen successful application of self-evaluation. Our cross-\\ndataset evaluation provides initial evidence that self-recognition is a general capability that can be\\namplified easily by fine-tuning on a small number of examples from one dataset. Our future work\\nwill validate the hypothesis on more text summarization datasets, more tasks, as well as more frontier\\nLLMs. We will also experiment with fine-tuning for self-recognition on the general domain rather\\nthan on a specific task.\\nVariance reduction. Our preliminary experiments indicate that the strength of both properties are\\ninsensitive to prompts, so all conditions use the same straightforward prompt design. To reduce\\nvariance, we will expand our experiments with more prompt designs in future work, including\\ninstructions to condition LLMs for better calibration (and reduce rejection responses). Along the\\nlines of fine-tuning on the general domain, we will also mix self-recognition with standard instruction\\nfollowing datasets to improve coverage on the spectrum of self-recognition signal strength.\\n5.3\\nConclusion\\nWe provide initial evidence towards the hypothesis that LLMs prefer their own generations because\\nthey recognize themselves. In addition to evaluating LLMs out-of-the-box, we show that fine-\\ntuning on a small number of examples elicit strong, generalizable self-recognition capability on\\nsummarization datasets. By varying fine-tuning task, we observe a linear correlation between self-\\nrecognition and self-preference, and validate that the correlation cannot be explained away by potential\\nconfounders. Our results establish self-recognition as a crucial factor in unbiased self-evaluation\\nas well as an important safety-related property. The experiment design also provides a blueprint to\\nexplore the effects of self-recognition on other downstream properties.\\n9\\nReferences\\nBai, Y., Kadavath, S., Kundu, S., Askell, A., Kernion, J., Jones, A., Chen, A., Goldie, A., Mirhoseini,\\nA., McKinnon, C., et al.
