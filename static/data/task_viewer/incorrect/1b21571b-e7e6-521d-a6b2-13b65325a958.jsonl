{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. IN THE RESPONSE, YOU SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN ONE TURN, THAT IS TO SAY, YOU SHOULD OUTPUT EXACTLY ONE THOUGHT AND ONTE ACTION. Now, let's start!\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "[Question]: What's the base model of MERU? Which institute is this base model from?\n[Answer Format]: Your answer should be a single python list like this: [\"model_name\", \"institute_name\"].

It is commonly said that \\u2018an image is worth a thousand words\\u2019 \\u2013\\nconsequently, images contain a lot more information than the sentences that describe them. For\\nexample, given Fig. 1 (middle image), one might describe it as \\u2018a cat and a dog playing in the street\\u2019\\nor with a less speci\\ufb01c sentence like \\u2018exhausted doggo\\u2019 or \\u2018so cute <3\\u2019. These are not merely diverse\\ndescriptions but contain varying levels of detail about the underlying semantic contents of the image.\\nAs humans, we can reason about the relative detail in each caption, and can organize such concepts\\ninto a meaningful visual-semantic hierarchy (Vendrov et al., 2016), namely, \\u2018exhausted doggo\\u2019 \\u2192\\u2018a\\ncat and a dog playing in the street\\u2019 \\u2192(Fig. 1 middle image). Providing multimodal models access to\\nthis inductive bias about vision and language has the potential to improve generalization (Radford\\net al., 2021), interpretability (Selvaraju et al., 2017) and enable better exploratory data analysis of\\nlarge-scale datasets (Schuhmann et al., 2022; Radford et al., 2021).\\npic of my labrador\\nin the snow\\na cat and a dog \\nplaying in the street\\nmy cat is photogenic \\nlook at those eyes!\\nexhausted doggo\\ncurious kitty\\nso cute <3\\nMERU: embed images and \\ntext in a hyperbolic space\\nCLIP: embed images and \\ntext in a Euclidean space\\nFigure 1: Hyperbolic image-text repre-\\nsentations.

Approaches\\nsuch as CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and ALIGN (Jia\\net al., 2021) have catalyzed a lot of recent progress\\nin computer vision by showing that Transformer-\\nbased (Vaswani et al., 2017) models trained using large\\namounts of image-text data from the internet can yield\\ntransferable representations, and such models can per-\\nform zero-shot recognition and retrieval using natural\\nlanguage queries. All these models represent images and\\ntext as vectors in a high-dimensional Euclidean, af\\ufb01ne\\nspace and normalize the embeddings to unit L2 norm.\\nHowever, such a choice of geometry can \\ufb01nd it hard to\\ncapture the visual-semantic hierarchy.\\nAn af\\ufb01ne Euclidean space treats all embedded points in\\nthe same manner, with the same distance metric being\\napplied to all points (Murphy, 2013). Conceptually, this\\ncan cause issues when modeling hierarchies \\u2013 a generic\\nconcept (closer to the root node of the hierarchy) is close\\nto many other concepts compared to a speci\\ufb01c concept\\n(which is only close to its immediate neighbors).

Such issues are handled naturally by hyperbolic spaces \\u2013 the volume increases exponentially\\nas we move away from the origin (Lee, 2019), making them a continuous relaxation of trees. This\\nallows a generic concept (\\u2018cat\\u2019) to have many neighbors by placing it close to the origin (Nickel &\\nKiela, 2017), and more speci\\ufb01c concepts further away. Thus, distinct speci\\ufb01c concepts like images in\\nFig. 1 can be far away from each other while being close to some generic concept (\\u2018animal\\u2019).\\nHyperbolic representations with MERU. In this work, we train the \\ufb01rst large-scale contrastive\\nimage-text models that embed data in a hyperbolic representation space (Nickel & Kiela, 2017) \\u2013\\nMERU that captures the visual-semantic hierarchy (Fig. 1). Importantly the hierarchy emerges in the\\nrepresentation space, given access only to image-text pairs during training such models. Practically,\\nMERU confers multiple bene\\ufb01ts such as (a) better performance on image retrieval and classi\\ufb01cation\\ntasks, (b) more ef\\ufb01cient usage of the embedding space, making it suited for resource-constrained,\\non-device scenarios, (c) an interpretable representation space that allows one to infer the relative\\nsemantic speci\\ufb01city of images and text. Overall, we summarize our contributions as follows:\\n\\u2013 We introduce MERU, the \\ufb01rst implementation of deep hyperbolic representations we are aware of,\\ntraining ViTs (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) with 12M image-text pairs.\\n\\u2013 We provide a strong CLIP baseline that outperforms previous re-implementations (Mu et al., 2022)\\nat comparable data scale, and systematically demonstrate the bene\\ufb01ts of hyperbolic representations\\nover this baseline on zero-shot retrieval and classi\\ufb01cation, and effectiveness for small embedding\\ndimensions (Kusupati et al., 2022).\\n\\u2013 We perform thorough qualitative analysis with MERU to demonstrate its potential for exploratory\\ndata analysis of large-scale multimodal datasets.\\n2\\nAPPROACH\\nIn this section, we discuss the modeling pipeline and learning objectives of MERU to learn hyperbolic\\nrepresentations of images and text. We use tools of hyperbolic geometry throughout our discussion,\\nsee Appendix B for a thorough discussion of the relevant topics.\\nOur model design is based on CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) due to its simplicity and scalability. As\\nshown in Fig. 2a, we process images and text using two separate encoders, and obtain embedding\\nvectors of a \\ufb01xed dimension n. Beyond this step, we introduce two differences on CLIP: (1) instead of\\nL2 normalization, we transfer the Euclidean embeddings from the encoder to the Lorentz hyperboloid,\\n(2) we use the negative of geodesic distance in the contrastive loss, instead of cosine similarity.\\nWe also use an additional textual entailment loss, illustrated for low-dimensions in Fig. 2b.

This is encouraging evidence that hyper-\\nbolic spaces have suitable geometric properties to learn\\nstrong representations for retrieval applications. Surpris-\\ningly, increasing the model size to ViT-L\\/16 does not\\nimprove image retrieval for both, MERU and CLIP.

While MERU is effective\\non recall-based measures (Table 1), it does not come at\\nthe expense of precision (Murphy, 2013). Overall, hyperbolic representations from MERU are\\ncompetitive with their Euclidean counterparts across varying model architectures (ViT-S\\/B\\/L).\\nAll models have near-random performance on four benchmarks. Concepts in these datasets have low\\ncoverage in RedCaps, like PCAM (Veeling et al., 2018) containing medical scans, or SST2 (Socher\\net al., 2013) containing movie reviews rendered as images.

If the representation space has captured the visual-semantic\\nhierarchy, then a shortest-path traversal from an image to the embedding that represents the most\\ngeneric concept (denoted as [ROOT]) should let us infer textual concepts that describe the image with\\nvarying levels of abstraction. Here we describe our analysis brie\\ufb02y, Appendix G for more details on\\nestimating [ROOT] and additional results.\\n3\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"Published at the First Workshop on Multimodal Representation Learning at ICLR 2023\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\na bengal cat\\nsitting beside\\nwheatgrass on a\\nwhite surface\\na bengal cat\\nsitting beside\\nwheatgrass on a\\nwhite surface\\nbengal\\n\\u2193\\ncat\\n\\u2193\\ndomestic\\n\\u2193\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\nwhite horse\\nwhite horse\\nequine\\n\\u2193\\nequestrian\\n\\u2193\\nbeauty\\n\\u2193\\nfemale\\n\\u2193\\n\\ufb02uffy\\n\\u2193\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\nphotography of\\nrainbow during\\ncloudy sky\\nphenomenon\\nrainbow\\n\\u2193\\nphenomenon\\n\\u2193\\nrural\\n\\u2193\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\nretro photo\\ncamera on table\\n\\u2193\\nfujinomiya\\n\\u2193\\nvintage\\n\\u2193\\nstyle\\n\\u2193\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\navocado toast\\navocado toast\\nhealthy\\nbreakfast\\ndelicious\\ndelicious\\n\\u2193\\nhomemade\\n\\u2193\\nfresh\\n\\u2193\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\nbrooklyn bridge\\nphoto of\\nbrooklyn bridge,\\nnew york\\nnew york city\\nnew york city\\ncity\\nnew york\\noutdoors\\n\\u2193\\nday\\n\\u2193\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\ntaj mahal\\ntaj mahal\\nthrough an arch\\nmonument\\ntravel\\narchitecture\\ninspiration\\ntravel\\n\\u2193\\nday\\n\\u2193\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nMERU\\nCLIP\\nsydney opera\\nhouse\\nsydney opera\\nhouse\\nopera house\\nopera house\\nholiday\\ngift\\nday\\nbeauty\\n[ROOT]\\n[ROOT]\\nFigure 3: Image traversals with MERU and CLIP. We perform text retrieval at multiple steps\\nwhile traversing from an image embedding to [ROOT]. Overall, CLIP retrieves fewer textual concepts\\n(top row), but in some cases it reveals a coarse hierarchy (bottom row). MERU captures hierarchy\\nwith signi\\ufb01cantly greater detail, we observe that: (1) Text becomes more generic we move towards\\n[ROOT], e.g., white horse \\u2192equestrian and retro photo camera \\u2192vintage. (2) MERU has higher\\nrecall of concepts than CLIP, like words in bottom row: homemade, city, monument. (3) MERU also\\nshows systematic text\\u2192image entailment, e.g., day entails many images captured in daylight.\\nWe traverse from an image and [ROOT] by interpolating 50 equally spaced steps along the geodesic\\nconnecting their embedding vectors. We use every interpolated step embedding as a query to perform\\nretrieve the nearest neighbor from a set of text embeddings X, that also include [ROOT]. We display\\nresults with 60 randomly selected images collected from pexels.com, a website that offers freely\\nusable stock photos. We collect 750 captions from the associated image metadata on this website\\nto create the set X. Fig. 3 shows results with eight selected images and captions from pexels.com.\\nCLIP seems to capture hierarchy to some extent, often retrieving very few (or zero) captions between\\nimage and [ROOT]. MERU captures it with \\ufb01ner granularity, retrieving concepts that gradually\\nbecome more generic as we move closer to [ROOT].\\n4\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we learn large-scale image-text representations (MERU) to capture the visual-semantic\\nhierarchy underlying images and text. Our key innovation is to bring the advances in learning\\nhyperbolic representations to practical, large-scale deep learning applications. MERU is competitive\\nor more performant than approaches that learn Euclidean representations (like CLIP) while also\\ncapturing hierarchical knowledge which allows one to make powerful inferences such as reasoning\\nabout images at different levels of abstraction, and performing semantic interpolations between images.\\nBeyond this, our model also provides clear performance gains for small embedding dimensions (which\\nare useful in resource-constrained settings). We hope this work catalyzes progress in learning useful\\nrepresentations from large amounts of unstructured data.\\n4\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
