{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We frst design the prompt-based autoregressive encoder to acquire the fne-grained representations (entity pair, object, and text), which contains two types of prefxes for integrating helpful information and characterizing intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. To avoid unhelpful visual information misleading the model, we design the dual-gated fusion module to distinguish the importance of image\\/objects via local and global gates. It also integrates the semantics of image transferred by Oscar (Li et al., 2020). The Fusion module outputs an enhanced representation. Later, the generative decoder is proposed for relation prediction, leveraging the implicit associations and restricting candidate relations by introducing entity types. Finally, we design the joint objective including distribution-consistency constraint, self-identifcation enhancement, and relation classifcation for model optimization.\\nGiven text $T$ , the word embeddings $\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times N}$ are obtained through the GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019) and then fed into a fully-connection layer, where $N$ is the word dimension.

We then extract object features using Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015) and select top$K$ objects using the ROI classifcation score.

However, the design of appropriate prefxes for fner associations learning in the MMRE task remains an open research question, and the direct use of prefxes from other tasks is not reasonable. Therefore, we construct two types of prefxes, an object-oriented prefx for inter-modal relevance (objects & text) and an entity-oriented prefx for intra-modal correlations (entity pair & text), encouraging the encoder to leverage text as a medium to strengthen multigranular associations to acquire enhanced semantic representations.\\n\\nObject-Oriented Prefx.

We frst design the prompt-based autoregressive encoder to acquire the fne-grained representations (entity pair, object, and text), which contains two types of prefxes for integrating helpful information and characterizing intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. To avoid unhelpful visual information misleading the model, we design the dual-gated fusion module to distinguish the importance of image\\/objects via local and global gates. It also integrates the semantics of image transferred by Oscar (Li et al., 2020). The Fusion module outputs an enhanced representation. Later, the generative decoder is proposed for relation prediction, leveraging the implicit associations and restricting candidate relations by introducing entity types. Finally, we design the joint objective including distribution-consistency constraint, self-identifcation enhancement, and relation classifcation for model optimization.\\nGiven text $T$ , the word embeddings $\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times N}$ are obtained through the GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019) and then fed into a fully-connection layer, where $N$ is the word dimension.

We then extract object features using Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015) and select top$K$ objects using the ROI classifcation score. Each object feature is obtained by the average grouping of ROI regions. The initial object representation is O = [o1; o2; . . . ; oK] \\u2208 RK\\u00d7N .\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Utilizing the advantages of prefx-tuning, the pretrained encoder (e.g., GPT-2 as our encoder) can be guided to learn task-specifc features for fast adaptation to the MMRE task (Liu et al., 2021). However, the design of appropriate prefxes for fner associations learning in the MMRE task remains an open research question, and the direct use of prefxes from other tasks is not reasonable. Therefore, we construct two types of prefxes, an object-oriented prefx for inter-modal relevance (objects & text) and an entity-oriented prefx for intra-modal correlations (entity pair & text), encouraging the encoder to leverage text as a medium to strengthen multigranular associations to acquire enhanced semantic representations.\\n\\nObject-Oriented Prefx. Given that objects related to entities are indeed useful information for the MMRE task, we propose an object-oriented prefx, termed as $\\\\mathcal{P}_{o}(\\\\cdot)$ , which provides guidance information of inter-modal relevance to the encoder. For the input text $T$ , we defne the following pattern \\u201cConsider $\\\\langle o b j e c t s\\\\rangle$ , predict relation.\\u201d, where $\\\\langle o b j e c t s\\\\rangle$ means the objects relevant to the entity pair of $T$ which is different for each input.

Due to the visual information may be incomplete or misleading, we argue that only an object-oriented prefx is insuffcient to capture classifcation information. Thus, we propose an entity-oriented prefx, termed as $\\\\mathcal{P}_{e}(\\\\cdot)$ , to capture intra-modal association to adapt the task.
