{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Prior benchmarks that provide demonstration datasets without executable environ-\\nments [12, 44, 25] assume a single solution for each task and limit potential research in interactive\\nlearning and real-world exploration.

It is a unified\\nenvironment for evaluating open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary apps. Using OSWORLD,\\nwe create a benchmark of 369 real-world tasks with reproducible setup and evaluation scripts.\\nTo address this gap, we introduce OSWORLD, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environ-\\nment for developing multimodal agents capable of executing a wide range of real computer tasks\\nbeyond isolated interfaces and applications. This executable environment allows free-form raw\\nkeyboard and mouse control of real computer applications and supports initial task state configu-\\nration, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across mainstream operating systems\\n(Ubuntu, Windows, macOS). OSWORLD enables evaluation of open-ended computer tasks that\\ninvolve arbitrary applications, ranging from image viewing to software functionality integration and\\nprogramming (Fig. 1). OSWORLD serves as a unified, real computer environment that allows users to\\ndefine their agent tasks without the need to build application\\/domain-specific simulated environments.\\nBuilding upon OSWORLD, we create a benchmark with 369 real-world tasks that involve widely-used\\nweb and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I\\/O, and multi-app workflows through both GUI and\\nCLI. Each example is based on real-world use cases and often requires interactions with multiple ap-\\nplications and interfaces. To ensure reliable, reproducible evaluation, 9 authors with computer science\\nbackgrounds carefully annotate each example with an initial state setup configuration to simulate\\nin-progress human work and a custom execution-based evaluation script to verify task completion.\\nOur benchmark has 134 unique evaluation functions \\u2014 significantly larger than prior work [71] \\u2014\\nshowcasing the complexity, diversity, and evaluation challenges of tasks in our benchmark.

The performance of these experiments ranges from 0.99% to\\n12.24%, with subsets of applications reaching 0%, for workflow tasks that involve cooperation from\\nmultiple apps, the highest performance of the baseline agent is 6.57%. This indicates that current\\nLLMs and VLMs are far from capable of serving as computer assistants (\\u00a74.2). Results also show\\nthat while additional knowledge such as the accessibility tree and Set-of-Mark (\\u00a74.1) can be helpful,\\nit can also lead to potential misguidance and varies across models.

Given\\ncurrent observation ot \\u2208O (a natural language instruction observation and a screenshot, accessibility\\na11y tree, or their combination according to facilities available), an agent generates executable action\\nat \\u2208A (e.g., clicking on the certain pixel of the screen \\u2014 .click(300, 540, button=\\u2018right\\u2019),\\npress key combination \\u2014 .hotkey(\\u2018ctrl\\u2019, \\u2018alt\\u2019, \\u2018t\\u2019)), which results in a new state st+1 \\u2208S\\n(e.g., current computer state) and a new partial observation ot+1 \\u2208O. The interaction loop repeats\\nuntil an action that marks termination (DONE or FAIL, see Sec. 2.4) is generated or the agent reaches\\nthe max number of steps (e.g., 15 in our experiments). OSWORLD implements an execution-based\\nreward function r : S \\u00d7 A \\u00d7 G \\u2192[0, 1]. The reward function awards a value of 1 or a positive\\ndecimal under 1 at the final step if the state transitions meet the expectations of the task objective\\n(i.e., the goal is successfully achieved or partially achieved), or if the agent accurately predicts failure\\nfor an infeasible task.

Tab. 1 illustrates evaluation processes including\\nextracting cookie data, fetching files from both virtual machines and cloud services, retrieving the\\ncurrent interface\\u2019s accessibility tree, and validating success by checking cookie deletions, table\\naccuracy, and interface access. See more in B.6.\\n2.3\\nObservation Space\\nThe observation space in OSWORLD contains the same desktop screenshot that human users perceive.\\nThis includes the mouse\\u2019s position and shape, application windows, files, and folders that are opened\\nin different sizes and orders. Also, similar to previous agent-building web and mobile research [34, 31,\\n12, 71] that provide and support the use of the webpage\\u2019s DOM and app\\u2019s view hierarchy, OSWORLD\\nalso provides accessibility (a11y) tree which can support additional information for modeling. These\\nraw observations allow rich interactions between multiple applications but induce challenges in\\nlong-horizon decision-making from high-resolution images (e.g., 4k screenshots) and structured long\\ntext (e.g., accessibility trees). A.2 describes observation space in more detail.\\n2.4\\nAction Space\\nAction space A in OSWORLD encompasses all mouse and keyboard actions, including movement,\\nclicks (left-key, right-key, multiple clicks), dragging, keystrokes, hotkeys, and others, covering all\\nhuman-computer action space. Some action examples are shown on the left and the complete action\\nlist can be found in A.3. Timing is also crucial, as highlighted in previous studies on mobile de-\\nvices [55], as well as the ability to determine whether a task is infeasible or completed. Therefore, we\\nadd three special actions named WAIT, FAIL, and DONE to enhance the aforementioned action spaces.\\n4\\nTable 2: Example mouse and keyboard actions A in OSWORLD.\\nSee App. A.3 for the complete list.\\nFunction\\nDescription\\nmoveTo(x, y)\\nMoves the mouse to the specified coordinates.\\nclick(x, y)\\nClicks at the specified coordinates.\\nwrite(\\u2018text\\u2019)\\nTypes the specified text at the current cursor location.\\npress(\\u2018enter\\u2019)\\nPresses the Enter key.\\nhotkey(\\u2018ctrl\\u2019, \\u2018c\\u2019)\\nPerforms the Ctrl+C hotkey combination (copy).\\nscroll(200)\\nScrolls up by 200 units.\\ndragTo(x, y)\\nDrags the mouse to the specified coordinates.\\nkeyDown(\\u2018shift\\u2019)\\nHolds down the Shift key.\\nkeyUp(\\u2018shift\\u2019)\\nReleases the Shift key.\\nWAIT\\nAgent decides it should wait.\\nFAIL\\nAgent decides the task is infeasible.\\nDONE\\nAgent decides the task is finished.\\nPrevious efforts towards creat-\\ning domain-specific agents, such\\nas MiniWoB++ [48, 34], CC-\\nNet [22], and WebArena [71, 26],\\nhave defined action spaces that\\ninclude clicks and typing, as well\\nas some actions specially de-\\nsigned for web browsing. How-\\never, they do not model all possi-\\nble actions on a computer, lead-\\ning to limitations when attempt-\\ning actions like right-clicking\\nand clicking with the ctrl key\\nheld to select items.\\nThis im-\\nposes an upper bound on agent\\nlearning capabilities.\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Particularly, code\\nsnippets that using python library \\u201cpyautogui\\u201d to control the mouse and keyboard are strongly\\nrecommended. Generally, mouse-based actions (e.g., click and scroll) directly manipulate the GUI\\nscreen, while keyboard-based actions (e.g., typewrite and hotkey) interact with the CLI such as the\\nbash terminal and code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).\\n19\\nJSON dict\\nInspired by the \\u201cpyautogui\\u201d library, we summarize 7 actions to simplify the action\\nspace. This small set can cover all CLI and GUI actions needed on the desktop. For each action\\nand its parameters, we further encapsulate it into a JSON dict to restrict the output format. The API\\nspecification and use cases are formally described in prompt messages (see App. I.1.2). And the\\nchecklist of all 7 actions is presented in Figure 9(b).\\nD.3\\nObservation Space\\n(1) screenshot\\n<desktop-frame name=\\u201cmain\\u201d coord=\\u201c(0,0)\\u201d size=\\u201c(1920,1080)\\u201d>\\n<application name=\\u201cChromium\\u201d coord=\\u201c(70, 64)\\u201d size=\\u201c(1442,814)\\u201d>\\n<frame name=\\u201cGraph: file_sizes_job - Chromium\\u201d showing=\\u201ctrue\\u201d visible=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>\\n<push-button name=\\u201cMinimize\\u201d enabled=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>. . .<\\/push-button>\\n<push-button name=\\u201cMaximize\\u201d enabled=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>. . .<\\/push-button>\\n<push-button name=\\u201cClose\\u201d enabled=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>. . .<\\/push-button>\\n<entry name=\\u201cAddress and search bar\\u201d>http:\\/\\/127.0.0.1:3000\\/. . .<\\/entry>\\n. . . # other elements\\n<\\/frame>\\n<\\/application>\\n<application name=\\u201cgnome-terminal-server\\u201d >\\n<frame name=\\u201cuser@ubuntu: ~\\/file-ops-and-jobs\\/\\u201d coord=\\u201c(70,27)\\u201d size=\\u201c(1442,851)\\u201d>\\n<filler name=\\u201c\\u201d coord=\\u201c(70, 64)\\u201d size=\\u201c(1442,814)\\u201d>\\n<menu name=\\u201cFile\\u201d coord=\\u201c(70,64)\\u201d size=\\u201c(40,25)\\u201d selectable=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>...<\\/menu>\\n<menu name=\\u201cEdit\\u201d coord=\\u201c(110,64)\\u201d size=\\u201c(43,25)\\u201d selectable=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>...<\\/menu>\\n<menu name=\\u201cView\\u201d coord=\\u201c(153,64)\\u201d size=\\u201c(49,25)\\u201d selectable=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>...<\\/menu>\\n<menu name=\\u201cHelp\\u201d coord=\\u201c(337,64)\\u201d size=\\u201c(47,25)\\u201d selectable=\\u201ctrue\\u201d>...<\\/menu>\\n. . . # other elements\\n<\\/filler>\\n<\\/frame>\\n<\\/application>\\n. . . # other application windows\\n<\\/desktop-frame>\\n(2) accessibility tree\\nFigure 10: Two observation types: screenshot and accessibility tree (a11ytree).\\nWith respect to observations, there are two widely used alternatives (see Figure 10): 1) image-style\\nscreenshot of the entire desktop, and 2) text-format accessibility tree (a11ytree). The accessibility\\ntree, obtained from the Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (ATSPI) library 11, is a\\ntext-format abstraction of the entire computer desktop which describes the name, type, status (e.g., a\\nmenu bar is \\u201cselectable\\u201d), position (e.g., in Figure 10 (2), the attributes \\u201ccoord\\u201d and \\u201csize\\u201d together\\ndefine the rectangle position), and text content embedded in each element (e.g., windows, panels,\\nbuttons, and input boxes). We extract a11ytree using python library pyatspi and convert it into\\nthe XML format. It functions similar to DOM (Document Object Model) tree for websites.\\nD.3.1\\nTwo tricks: Set-of-Mark and Execution Feedback\\nFigure 11: Screenshot with bounding boxes.\\n. . .\\n. . .\\nFigure 12: Converted table of a11ytree.\\nFigure 13: Illustration of the aligned observation type set-of-mark (SoM).\\nSet-of-Mark (SoM)\\nThe original text-style accessibility tree (a11ytree) and image-style screen-\\nshot do not align with each other. To compensate for this deficiency, we follow OSWORLD [37] and\\nWebArena [48] to draw bounding boxes for elements of interest in the screenshot and label these\\nelements with numeric indexes. The accurate coordinates of these bounding boxes are extracted from\\nthe a11ytree. Furthermore, we re-organize the a11ytree into a table (each leaf node in a11ytree\\nis converted into one row) and insert another attribute\\/column \\u201cindex\\u201d for each node in the tree. The\\nvalue of attribute \\u201cindex\\u201d is exactly the numeric label of the corresponding element in the screenshot.\\nThe aligned screenshot and a11ytree (a.k.a., set-of-mark, SoM [39]) are illustrated in Figure 13.\\n11https:\\/\\/docs.gtk.org\\/atspi2\\/\\n20\\nExamples of Execution Feedback Messages\\nHere are failed actions with their error messages in your last response:\\n# Action 1\\nimport pyautogui\\nindex_34 = (23, 43)\\npyautogui.click(index_343)\\n# Execution error:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nNameError: name 'index_343' is not defined\\n# Action 2\\nimport pyautogui\\nimport time\\npyautogui.write('USE DATABASE IMDB\\\\n\\\\\\\\n')\\n# Execution error:\\nFile \\\"<string>\\\" line 3\\npyautogui.write('USE DATABASE IMDB\\n^\\nSyntaxError: unterminated string literal\\nExecution Feedback\\nWe also incorporate another type of information as the observation, namely\\nthe execution feedback of actions (see messages above). We notice that, some predicted actions may\\nbe parsed erroneously or fail to be executed. In this case, the two observation types mentioned before\\nare not changed at all. And the agent repeatedly urges to conduct the same incorrect action. To inform\\nthe agent of execution errors, we include this execution feedback as the third observation type.\\nE\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
