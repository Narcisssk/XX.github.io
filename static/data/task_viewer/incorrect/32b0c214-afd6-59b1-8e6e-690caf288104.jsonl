{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

DP-SGD algorithm could be realized via three\\ninterleaved steps: clipping per-sample gradient, sampling a random noise z \\u223cN(0, \\u03c32I), and adding\\nz to the accumulated clipped gradient. The variance parameter \\u03c32 is determined by several factors\\nincluding total training steps, \\u03f5, and \\u03b4.\\n2.1\\nENHANCING FLATNESS IN WHITE-BOX SETTING\\nTo mitigate the negative impact of private training, we propose a flatness-aware framework, termed as\\nPrivacy-Flat, to enhance the accuracy-privacy trade-off. Specifically, considering a multi-layer white-\\nbox model, we smooth the sharp local minima of LLMs comprehensively from three perspectives,\\nincluding within-layer, cross-layer, and cross-model weight flattening.\\nWithin-layer Weight Flattening. We mainly adjust adversarial weight perturbation (AWP) (Wu\\net al., 2020) to flatten the weight loss landscape. In detail, Let w represent the trainable parameters\\nin LLMs, and let D represent the training dataset. Typically in prefix tuning of LLMs, w is given\\nby the appending learnable tokens at each layer (Li & Liang, 2021). AWP updates the model\\nweights with two gradient backpropagation steps: First, v = arg maxv L(D; w + v); Second,\\nw \\u2190(w + v) \\u2212\\u03b7\\u2207w+vL(D; w + v) \\u2212v. We tailor AWP to DP-SGD with two critical changes.\\nFirst, we only consider applying the adversarial perturbation gradients in the first T rounds of training,\\nfollowing which the normal model updating is turned on. With this procedure, we can save the\\nexternal time cost of adversarial computation while guiding the model towards a smooth loss region.\\nSecond, during the initial T rounds, the required noises in DP-SGD are only added to the final\\ngradient \\u2207w+vL(D; w + v), instead of the process of computing v.\\nCross-layers Weight Flattening. Given a n-layer LLMs, prefix weights wi are appended at the i-th\\nlayer and we have w = [w1, ..., wn]. However, as the prefix added to a layer influences its following\\noutput, the flatness of the weight loss landscape is determined by where the prefix modules are added.\\nThus we explore how to quickly quantify the model sharpness and how to adopt it for controlling the\\npositions of prefix layers.\\nDefinition 1 (Prefix Sharpness). Given prefix parameters w\\u2032 within a box in parameter space C\\u03b7\\nwith sides of length \\u03b7 > 0, centered around a minima of interest at parameters w, the sharpness of\\nloss \\u2207L(w) at w is defined as: Sharpness :=\\nmaxw\\u2032\\u2208C\\u03b7(L(w\\u2032)\\u2212L(w))\\n1+L(w)\\n.\\nIn practice, we approximate the above prefix sharpness by sampling prefix weights w\\u2032: w\\u2032 \\u2208\\n{w \\u2212\\u03b7\\u2207L(w|D)|\\u03b7 \\u2208[0, 1]}. Based on the sharpness definition, we design a greedy solution to\\ngradually eliminate the prefix layers and keep those resulting in lowest sharpness. First, with the\\nprefix initialization at all the layers of LLMs, we can compute the its sharpness value. Next we remove\\none prefix layer each time and calculate the corresponding sharpness of remaining model parameters.\\nThe prefix layer where its removing is associated with the lowest sharpness will be permanently\\ndeleted. We will continue this loop until the remaining prefixes meet our sparse requirement or the\\nsharpness metric does not decrease.\\n3\\nPublished at ICLR 2024 Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Large Language Models\\n(a)\\n(b)\\n(c)\\nFigure 3: (a): Comparison of MIA accuracy under both white-box and black-box settings on SST-2;\\n(b): Performance of Privacy-Flat compared with baseline methods in black-box settings; (c): Ablation\\nstudy on SST-2 where we gradually remove our methods.\\nCross-models Weight Flattening. Recall that DP-SGD inevitably results in a sharper loss landscape\\nthan that of normal training. One of the intuitive ways to generalize private model is to regularize it\\nwith the normal counterpart via knowledge distillation (Gou et al., 2021). For this purpose, given\\nparameters w fine-tuned with DP framework, we create their duplicates wnor using the same network\\narchitecture and initialization but fine-tuning them normally. We then define a new term of loss\\nfunction to force the weight closeness between w and wnor: Lg = \\u2225w \\u2212wnor\\u22252 Therefore, the final\\nloss function will be: Lf = L(D|w) + \\u03bbLg, where L can be any loss function in general, such as\\ncross-entropy loss for sentence classification tasks, and \\u03bb is the balancing factor for regularization. It\\nis minimized using the DP-SGD framework to achieve both data privacy protection and the desired\\naccuracy. Finally, we summarize our training pipeline for the white-box setting in the Appendix\\nAppendix A.3. and show how each part of Privacy-Flat helps to reduce the sharpness in Appendix A.4.\\n2.2\\nENHANCING FLATNESS IN BLACK-BOX SETTING\\nWhile LLMs of interest are oftentimes black boxes, i.e., their weights are not accessible for training.\\nin this section, we extend our Privacy-Flat framework to the black-box settings. And we will utilize\\nzeroth-order (ZO) optimizer (Malladi et al., 2023) to estimate the gradient and DPZero (Zhang\\net al., 2023) to provide the DP guarantee. Implementing zeroth-order optimization is not enough\\nfor considering application in the real-world scenario since the weights of black-box models are not\\naccessible. In this case, only manipulating input embedding is more practical. Therefore, in the\\nblack-box setting, we adopt Prompt Tuning (Lester et al., 2021), which only adds learnable tokens\\nbefore input embedding.\\nIn the black-box setting, we only consider improving through non-private duplication. Compared with\\nthe white-box setting, wnor is also trained with the black-box setting. We don\\u2019t consider enhancing\\nthe within-layer weight flatness since the min-max training framework with zeroth order optimization\\nsuffers from the high variance of an additional gradient estimation to compute v (Zhang et al., 2022).\\n2.3\\nDISCUSSION\\nSince Privacy-Flat does not consider the DP framework every time like generating model perturbation\\ngradient v, Privacy-Flat cannot provide a strict DP guarantee. Though our method cannot provide a\\nstrict DP guarantee, we prove that under the framework of DP-SGD, our method can still have good\\nprivacy in the experimental parts and thus improve the trade-off between accuracy and privacy. We\\nleave the theoretical proof of why Privacy-Flat can still maintain good privacy in future work.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Methods\\nWe propose an approach for visual explanations of neural responses to out-of-category (ooc.) stimuli\\nin category-selective visual brain areas. The categories currently of most interest in the high-level\\nvision literature are faces and bodies, but the method can be applied to any semantic category. We\\nleverage differentiable neuron models to explain high neural firing rates in response to an ooc. image\\nby analysing visual similarity to an image from the preferred category which also drives the neuron.\\nFormally, let xout \\u2208R3\\u00d7h\\u00d7w denote an ooc. image yielding high activity from a recorded category-\\nselective neuron. The overall goal of this work is to determine the visual features of xout driving the\\nneural response. We approach this problem in three steps:\\n1. We learn a linear readout vector w on top of a pretrained CNN f(\\u00b7) to predict neural\\nresponses to within-category stimuli xin,1, . . . , xin,N. The learned vector then incorporates\\ninformation about which features apparent in within-category images are relevant for the\\nneural response.\\n2. We employ a neuron-specific similarity metric based on the learned readout to find a within-\\ncategory image xin with similar visual features as xout. Visual inspection of this reference\\nimage on its own can yield insights on why xout activates the neuron.\\n3. We backpropagate gradients of CNN activations to the pixels of both images and reweight\\nthem to highlight features that are\\n(a) present in xout,\\n(b) present in xin,\\n(c) highly relevant for the neural response.\\nExplicitly highlighting shared features helps identify specific image regions responsible for\\nthe images\\u2019 neuron-specific similarity.\\n3\\n3.1\\nModelling neural responses\\nIn recent years, a pretrained CNN backbone combined with a trainable linear readout module has\\nbecome the gold standard in modelling the stimulus-driven variance in neural responses to images\\n[22, 23]. In these models, an image x \\u2208R3\\u00d7h\\u00d7w is fed through a CNN f(\\u00b7) up to a predetermined\\nlayer to obtain a latent representation a \\u2208Rc. The predicted response for a neuron is then computed\\nas\\n\\u02c6\\ny = \\u27e8a, w\\u27e9,\\n(1)\\nwhere w \\u2208Rc is a learned weight vector, and \\u27e8\\u00b7, \\u00b7\\u27e9denotes the standard dot product. The vector w\\nencapsulates information about which visual dimensions the neuron is tuned to, as a large w(i) implies\\nthat increased activity in feature i will strongly increase the predicted neural response. Conversely,\\nw(i) = 0 implies no change in predicted activity if feature i is manipulated and thus such features\\ncan be ignored when trying to understand a neuron\\u2019s response pattern (assuming a perfect model\\nfit). Therefore, training a model to predict neural responses to within-category stimuli reveals which\\nvisual features drive responses within the category. If the model then generalizes to ooc. stimuli, we\\ncan infer that ooc. neural responses are driven by features present in both data distributions.\\n3.2\\nNeuron-specific image similarity\\nIf an image xout strongly drives a neuron, we propose to interpret the relevant image features by\\nstudying a visually similar image from the category that the neuron is selective to. To quantify\\nsimilarity, we adapt the common method of computing the cosine similarity of latent activations\\ncomputed using a CNN [24]. Since we have additional information on which latent dimensions drive\\nthe neuron, we weight feature i by the corresponding weight w(i). Formally, for images x1, x2 and\\ntheir corresponding latent activations a1 := f(x1), a2 := f(x2), we define the neuron-specific image\\nsimilarity as\\ns(x1, x2) :=\\n\\u27e8a1 \\u2299w, a2 \\u2299w\\u27e9\\n||a1 \\u2299w||2||a2 \\u2299w||2\\n,\\n(2)\\nwhere \\u2299denotes the Hadamard product. Since w is often sparse, this formulation will effectively\\nignore most dimensions and focus solely on those that are highly relevant for predicting the neural\\nresponse. For the downstream procedure of generating a visual explanation for the neural response to\\nthe image xout, we simply select the most similar image from our within-category dataset, i.e.\\nxin = arg max{s(xout, x) : x \\u2208Dc},\\n(3)\\nwhere Dc denotes the set of within-category images.\\n3.3\\nParallel backpropagation for shared-feature visualization\\nEven though the images xout and xin ideally have a high similarity metric, the similar features are not\\nalways clearly identifiable. In some cases, the features might not be easily interpretable, or in other\\ncases, several features might be shared upon visual inspection, such that it remains unclear whether\\nall of them or a subset contribute to neural activity.\\nIn order to further highlight shared features contributing to model activity, we compute weighted\\ngradients of the latent model activations w.r.t. to image pixels [16]. This method was originally\\ndevised for classification models to highlight those image pixels that most strongly influence a given\\nclass probability. We build on this work to visualize shared features between images by introducing a\\nsimple reweighting procedure. Specifically, we strengthen the influence of features that are shared,\\nwhile attenuating features that are specific to only one of the images. For the sake of brevity, we\\nillustrate the procedure for the gradients of xout only, as the process is analogous for xin. First of all,\\nnote that the gradient of the predicted neural response \\u02c6\\nyout is given by\\n\\u2202\\u02c6\\nyout\\n\\u2202xout\\n=\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202xout\\n\\u27e8aout, w\\u27e9=\\nX\\ni\\nw(i)\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202xout\\na(i)\\nout.\\n(4)\\nDue to the sum rule of calculus, the gradient of the predicted response is given by a weighted sum of\\nthe gradients of the latent features, with w(i) acting as weight for feature i. Hence, features that are\\nhighly relevant for model predictions will dominate the gradient.

We then calculate the normalized Hadamard\\nproduct of the activation vectors and the element-wise square of the learned linear readout vector\\nfor the considered neuron. The pixel saliency map is then computed as the sum of gradients of each\\nfeature, weighted by the feature\\u2019s entry in the Hadamard product.\\ninfinitesimal increase would strongly enhance one of the highly relevant features will be assigned a\\nhigh intensity when plotting the gradient over the image.\\nFor our purposes, this gradient map is not satisfactory. First of all, it does not take the other image into\\naccount at all, and thus fails to leverage the images\\u2019 similarity structure. Further, since the gradient\\nweights do not carry information on whether a feature is present in the image in the first place, it is\\ntheoretically possible to assign high intensity to pixels that would strongly increase features with\\nlow activity. To remedy these deficiencies, we propose an adjusted pixel saliency map I based on\\nreplacing the weights for the features in (4).\\nBefore reweighting the features, we first smooth and normalize each gradient to have unit norm, i.e.\\n||\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202xout a(i)\\nout||2 = 1. Smoothing alleviates pixel-level noise and allows the user to determine regions of\\npixels with high contribution. It has been shown that a post-processing smoothing step substantially\\nimproves the quality of gradient-based attributions [20]. Normalization ensures that the pixel saliency\\nmap is not determined solely by the gradient magnitude, as some features may be more sensitive to\\npixel perturbation than others. More importantly, it allows us to later bound the norm of the saliency\\nmap from above, which substantially improves interpretability. Subsequently, we weight each feature\\nby its contribution to the neuron-specific similarity metric s(\\u00b7, \\u00b7) given in (2). Formally, we define the\\nweight for feature i as\\n\\u03b2(i) :=\\na(i)\\nin w(i)a(i)\\noutw(i)\\n||ain \\u2299w||2||aout \\u2299w||2\\n,\\n(5)\\nand finally the pixel saliency maps\\nI(xout; xin, w) :=\\nX\\ni\\n\\u03b2(i)\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202xout\\na(i)\\nout,\\nI(xin; xout, w) :=\\nX\\ni\\n\\u03b2(i) \\u2202\\n\\u2202xin\\na(i)\\nin .\\n(6)\\nThe revised weight vector \\u03b2 imposes high weights only on those features that are highly activated in\\nthe feature vectors of both images (captured by a(i)\\n1\\nand a(i)\\n2 ), and are also relevant for the neuron\\u2019s\\nactivity (captured by (w(i))2). Dividing by the product of norms allows us to bound the intensity of\\n5\\nthe saliency maps by writing\\n||I(xout; xin, w)||2 = ||\\nX\\ni\\n\\u03b2(i)\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202xout\\na(i)\\nout||2 \\u2264\\nX\\ni\\n||\\u03b2(i)\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202xout\\na(i)\\nout||2\\n=\\nX\\ni\\n\\u03b2(i) ||\\n\\u2202\\n\\u2202xout\\na(i)\\nout||2\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\n=1\\n=\\nX\\ni\\n\\u03b2(i) = s(xin, xout).\\n(7)\\nNote that this inequality only holds if a(i)\\nin \\u22650 and a(i)\\nout \\u22650 for all i = 1, . . . , c, as this is needed to\\nensure \\u03b2(i) > 0. However, this constraint is usually satisfied as latent activation are commonly fed\\nthrough a ReLU layer before extraction. The inequality yields that the total intensity of the pixel\\nsaliency map (for either image) as given by its L2 norm is bounded by the neuron-specific similarity.\\nThus if the images are dissimilar, the saliency maps will have low intensity. Finally, note here that the\\nreweighting procedure is agnostic to the way the salience map for each feature is generated. Any\\n(backpropagation) pixel-attribution method may be used, as long as each latent feature is assigned\\none saliency map with unity norm.\\nRunning these steps successively for one recorded neuron yields as output one ooc. image and one\\nwithin-category image, along with one saliency map per image. To study shared features, we display\\nthe images side-by-side with the saliency maps overlayed, as seen in Figs 4 and 5.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

The proposed method proceeds via 4 steps: 1. generate\\nbatch of molecules. 2. filter molecules based on pool to enforce substructure presence, discarding\\nthe rest. 3. compute reward 4. update the model. After updating the model, if the reward has\\nimproved for consecutive epochs, execute Beam Enumeration. b. Beam Enumeration sequentially\\nenumerates the top k tokens by probability for N beam steps, resulting in an exhaustive set of token\\nsub-sequences. c. All valid substructures (either by the Structure or Scaffold criterion) are extracted\\nfrom the sub-sequences. The most frequent substructures are used for self-conditioned generation.\\nThis overview figure is the same as in the main text.\\nBeam Enumeration (Fig. A4) is an algorithm that extracts molecular substructures from a generative\\nmodel\\u2019s weights for self-conditioned generation. The problem set-up is any molecular design task\\nto optimize for a target property profile, e.g., high predicted solubility and binding affinity. When\\nmolecular generative models are coupled with an optimization algorithm, it should be increasingly\\nlikely to generate desirable molecules, i.e., molecules that possess the target property profile.\\nBeam Enumeration is proposed based on two facts:\\n1. On a successful optimization trajectory, the model\\u2019s weights must change such that desir-\\nable molecules are more likely to be generated, on average.\\n2. The act of generating molecules in an autoregressive manner involves sequentially sam-\\npling from conditional probability distributions.\\nIn this work, Beam Enumeration is applied to a language-based autoregressive generative model\\noperating on the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) (Weininger (1988) rep-\\n16\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nresentation. The optimization algorithm is Augmented Memory (Guo & Schwaller (2023) which\\nbuilds on REINVENT (Olivecrona et al. (2017); Blaschke et al. (2020) and casts the optimization\\nprocess as an on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Following RL terminology, sampling\\nfrom the generative model involves sampling trajectories, which in this case, are SMILES, and the\\ndesirability of the corresponding molecule is given by the reward.\\nThe underlying hypothesis of Beam Enumeration is that during the RL optimization process, partial\\ntrajectories provide a source of signal that can be exploited. Usually, full trajectories are sampled\\nwhich map to a complete SMILES sequence that can be translated to a molecule. Our assumption\\nis that partial trajectories (partial SMILES sequence) can be mapped to molecular substructures (a\\npart of the full molecule). This statement is not guaranteed as SMILES and molecules are discrete\\nand small perturbations often leads to invalid SMILES. We prove this assumption in Section C by\\nshowing that although the vast number of partial trajectories do not map to valid SMILES, the raw\\nnumber is sufficient to extract a meaningful signal. Correspondingly, Beam Enumeration leverages\\npartial trajectories on the assumption that molecular substructures are on track to becoming full\\nmolecules that would receive high reward.\\nA.2\\nENUMERATING PARTIAL TRAJECTORIES\\nIn order to extract molecular substructures, a set of partial trajectories must be sampled from the\\ngenerative model. Recalling the fact that on a successful optimization trajectory, it must become\\nincreasingly likely to generate desirable molecules, partial trajectories are sampled by enumerating\\nthe top k tokens, based on the conditional probability. Therefore, the process of enumerating par-\\ntial trajectories involves sequentially extending each token sequence by their next top k probable\\ntokens, resulting in the total number of partial trajectories as 2N where N is the number of beam\\nsteps, i.e., how many tokens in the partial trajectory. We note that taking the top k most proba-\\nble tokens does not guarantee that the partial trajectories are indeed the most probable, as paying a\\nprobability penalty early can lead to higher probabilities later. However, our assumption is that on\\naverage, this leads to a set of partial trajectories that are at the very least, amongst the most probable.\\nMoreover, there is a practical limit to how many partial trajectories are sampled due to exponential\\ngrowth which makes scaling quickly computationally prohibitive. In the later section, we discuss\\nthis thoroughly. Finally, from here, partial trajectories will be referred to as token sub-sequences.\\nA.3\\nEXTRACTING MOLECULAR SUBSTRUCTURES\\nGiven a set of token sub-sequences, the goal is to extract out the most frequent molecular substruc-\\ntures. This is done by taking each sequence, considering every (sub)-sub-sequence, and counting\\nthe number of valid substructures (Fig. A). For example, given the sub-sequence \\u201cABCD\\u201d, the set of\\n(sub)-sub-sequences are: \\u201cA\\u201d, \\u201cAB\\u201d, \\u201cABC\\u201d, and \\u201cABCD\\u201d. In practice, we only consider (sub)-sub-\\nsequences with at least three characters (\\u201cABC\\u201d and \\u201cABCD\\u201d) since each character loosely maps to\\none atom and three is approximately the minimum for meaningful functional groups, e.g., \\u201cC=O\\u201d, a\\ncarbonyl. The set of most frequent substructures is assumed to be on track to receive a high reward.\\nA.4\\nDEFINING MOLECULAR SUBSTRUCTURES: Scaffold VS. Structure\\nAs shown in Fig. A, molecular substructures can be defined on the Scaffold or Structure level.\\nThe former extracts the Bemis-Murcko (Bemis & Murcko (1996) scaffold while the latter extracts\\nany valid structure. The any valid structure is an important distinction as our experiments find that\\nextracting by Structure leads to the most frequent molecular substructures being small functional\\ngroups that do not have corresponding scaffolds. By contrast, extracting the scaffold always leads to\\nring structures. Moreover, extracting specifically the Bemis-Murcko scaffold is important as heavy\\natoms, e.g., nitrogen, are important for biological activity. Consequently, extracted substructures are\\nalso enforced to contain at least one heavy atom as we find that benzene, perhaps unsurprisingly, is\\ncommonly the most frequent substructure. See Section B for more details on the differing behavior\\nof \\u2018Scaffold\\u2019 vs. \\u2018Structure\\u2019.\\n17\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nA.5\\nSELF-CONDITIONED GENERATION\\nSelf-conditioned generation is achieved by filtering sampled batches of molecules from the gener-\\native model to only keep the ones that possess at least one of the most frequent substructures. The\\neffect is that the generative process is self-biased to focus on a narrower chemical space which we\\nshow can drastically improve sample efficiency at the expense of some diversity, which is acceptable\\nwhen expensive high-fidelity oracles are used: we want to identify a small set of excellent candidate\\nmolecules under minimal oracle calls.\\nA.6\\nPROBABILISTIC EXPLAINABILITY\\nThe set of most frequent molecular substructures should be meaningful as otherwise, the model\\u2019s\\nweights would not have been updated such that these substructures have become increasingly likely\\nto be generated. We verify this statement in the illustrative experiment in the main text and in\\nSection C. In the drug discovery case studies (Appendix D), the extracted substructures are more\\nsubtle in why they satisfy the target objective but certainly must possess meaning, however subtle,\\nas otherwise, they would not receive a high reward. In the main text, we show that extracted sub-\\nstructures form core scaffolds and structural motifs in the generated molecules that complement the\\nprotein binding cavity. Finally, we emphasize that the correctness and usefulness of this explainabil-\\nity deeply depends on the oracle(s) being optimized for. The extracted substructures do not explain\\nwhy the generated molecules satisfy the target objective. Rather, they explain why the generated\\nmolecules satisfy the oracle. The assumption in a generative design task is that optimizing the or-\\nacle is a good proxy for the target objective, e.g., generating molecules that dock well increases\\nthe likelihood of the molecules being true binders. This observation directly provides additional\\ncommentary on why sample efficiency is so important: the ability to directly optimize expensive\\nhigh-fidelity oracles would inherently enhance the correctness of the extracted substructures.\\nB\\nBEAM ENUMERATION: FINDINGS FROM HYPERPARAMETER SCREENING\\nIn this section, we introduce all seven hyperparameters of Beam Enumeration and then present\\nresults on an exhaustive hyperparameter search which elucidates the behavior and interactions of\\nall the hyperparameters. In the end, we present our analyses and provide hyperparameter recom-\\nmendations for Beam Enumeration which can serve as default values to promote out-of-the-box\\napplication.\\nB.1\\nBEAM ENUMERATION HYPERPARAMETERS\\nBeam k. This hyperparameter denotes how many tokens to enumerate at each step. Given that our\\nhypothesis is that the most probable sub-sequences yield meaningful substructures, we fix Beam k\\nto 2. A larger value would also decrease the number of Beam Steps possible as the total number of\\nsub-sequences is kN and the exponential growth quickly leads to computational infeasibility.\\nBeam Steps N. This hyperparameter denotes how many token enumeration steps to execute and is\\nthe final token length of the enumerate sub-sequences. This parameter leads to exponential growth\\nin the number of sequences which can quickly become computationally prohibitive. An important\\nimplication of this hyperparameter is that larger Beam Steps means that larger substructures can be\\nextracted. In our experiments, we find that enforcing size in the extracted substructures can dras-\\ntically improve sample efficiency with decreased diversity as the trade-off. We thoroughly discuss\\nthis in a later sub-section. Finally, in our experiments, the upper-limit investigated is 18 Beam Steps.\\nSubstructure Type. This hyperparameter has two possible values: Scaffold or Structure. Scaf-\\nfold extracts Bemis-Murcko (Bemis & Murcko (1996) scaffolds while Structure extracts any valid\\nsubstructure.\\nStructure Structure Minimum Size. This hyperparameter enforces the partial SMILES to contain\\nat least a certain number of characters. In effect, this enforces extracted molecular substructures\\nto be larger than a Structure Minimum Size. From the illustrative experiment in the main text and\\nSection C, Structure extraction often leads to small functional groups being the most frequent in\\nthe sub-sequences. By enforcing a minimum structure size, Structure extraction leads to partial\\n18\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nstructures which may carry more meaning. We find that this hyperparameter greatly impacts sample\\nefficiency and we present all our findings in a later sub-section.\\nPool Size. This hyperparameter controls how many molecular substructures to keep track of. These\\npooled substructures are what is used to perform self-conditioning. The hypothesis is that the most\\nfrequent ones carry the most meaning and thus, a very large pool size may not be desired.\\nPatience. This hyperparameter controls how many successive reward improvements are required\\nbefore Beam Enumeration executes and molecular substructures are extracted. Recalling the first\\nfact in which Beam Enumeration was proposed on: On a successful optimization trajectory, the\\nmodel\\u2019s weights must change such that desirable molecules are more likely to be generated, on\\naverage. Patience is effectively an answer to \\u201dwhen would extracted substructures be meaningful?\\u201d\\nToo low a patience and stochasticity can lead to negative effects while too high a patience diminishes\\nthe benefits of Beam Enumeration on sample efficiency.\\nToken Sampling Method. This hyperparameter has two possible values: \\u201dtopk\\u201d or \\u201dsample\\u201d and\\ndenotes how tokens sub-sequences are enumerated. \\u201dtopk\\u201d takes the top k most probable tokens at\\neach Beam Step while \\u201dsample\\u201d samples from the distribution just like during batch generation. Our\\nresults show interesting observations surrounding this hyperparameter as \\u201dsample\\u201d can work just as\\nwell and sometimes even better than taking the \\u201dtopk\\u201d. These results were unexpected as the under-\\nlying hypothesis is that the most probable sub-sequences lead to the most useful substructures being\\nextracted. However, our findings are not in contradiction as sampling the conditional probability\\ndistributions would still lead to sampling the top k tokens, on average. Moreover, after extensive\\nexperiments, we find that \\u201dsample\\u201d leads to more variance in performance across replicates which is\\nin agreement with the assumption that sampling the distributions can lead to more improbable struc-\\ntures. We thoroughly discuss our findings in a later sub-section where we provide hyperparameter\\nrecommendations and analyses to the effects of tuning each hyperparameter.\\nB.2\\nHYPERPARAMETERS: GRID SEARCH\\nWe performed two exhaustive hyperparameter grid searches on the illustrative experiment which has\\nthe following multi-parameter optimization (MPO) objective: maximize topological polar surface\\narea (tPSA), molecular weight <350 Da, number of rings \\u22652 with an oracle budget of 5,000.

In the following we present the different components of the contrastive learning\\nframework. Specifically, we describe the text and audio encoders, the similarity matching and\\ncontrastive learning procedure for training, and the alignment decoding. For an overview figure and\\nmore details refer to the original paper. We conclude with a few comments.\\nAudio Encoder. The audio encoder fa is designed to detect the phonetic content of the singing voice\\nin the audio. It processes input spectrograms X \\u2208RT \\u00d7D with a duration of 5 seconds, where T is\\nthe number of spectrogram frames and D is the number of frequency bins. The encoder is a residual\\nnetwork comprising 10 residual convolutional blocks (RCBs), each containing 2 repetitions of group\\nnormalization, ReLU activation, and a 2D convolutional layer with a 3 \\u00d7 3 kernel and 64 features.\\nThe output is a 1D convolution layer applied on each time bin with E = 64 filters, resulting in an\\nembedding matrix A \\u2208RT \\u00d7E.\\nText Encoder. The text encoder fl estimates how the singing voice could sound for any given lyrics\\nsymbol. To account for the pronunciation dependence on neighboring symbols, the encoder processes\\nthe subsequence sn\\u2212C, . . . , sn, . . . , sn+C for each symbol sn in the lyrics, which could be characters,\\nphonemes, or other text representations. These symbols are passed through a trainable embedding\\nlayer, and a simple dense network with one hidden layer and ReLU activation, yielding an E-dim.\\nembedding for each symbol. A given N-symbol lyrics sequence is thus mapped to an embedding\\nmatrix L \\u2208RN\\u00d7E. Both the text and audio encoder embeddings are l2 normalized to enable cosine\\nsimilarity comparisons.\\nSimilarity Matching and Training. For training, a contrastive learning approach is employed.\\nPositive examples s+ are taken from the lyrics corresponding to a given audio segment, while\\nnegative examples s\\u2212are sampled from the distribution ps over symbols obtained from all lyrics\\nin the dataset that do not appear in the audio segment. The similarity between the text and audio\\nembeddings is maximized for positive pairs and minimized for negative pairs with the following\\nobjective\\nL = E(X,s+)\\u223cpd\\n\\u0002\\n(m(X, s+) \\u22121)2 + Es\\u2212\\u223cpsm(X, s\\u2212)2\\u0003\\n,\\n(1)\\nwhere pd is the distribution over audio segments and symbols sampled from the corresponding lyrics\\nsequence, and m(X, s) = maxt\\u2208[1,T ] fl(s) \\u00b7 fa(X)\\u22a4\\nt is the maximum similarity of symbol s over\\nthe entire audio segment X.\\nAlignment Decoding. Post-training, the alignment is performed on a normalized similarity matrix\\nS = 1\\n2(A \\u00b7 L\\u22a4+ 1), ensuring that S \\u2208[0, 1]T \\u00d7N. A similarity matrix example is shown in Fig. 1.\\n1https:\\/\\/github.com\\/tikick\\/LyricsAlignment\\n2https:\\/\\/github.com\\/tikick\\/JamendoLyricspp\\n2\\nFigure 1: The similarity matrix above, and the ground truth word alignment below. Observe the\\nvertical bright stripes at the start of each word.\\nThe alignment is decoded using a modified Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm [18], which\\nexcludes horizontal score accumulation and vertical steps. That is, the algorithm finds a monotonic\\npath that maximizes the cumulative similarity score across the diagonal steps. This decoding algorithm\\nis applied on the log-transformed similarity matrix. The authors thus interpret the similarity matrix S\\nas a probability matrix and decode the most likely path in the log space.\\nFrames Concentration. Inspecting the similarity matrix S (see Fig. 1) reveals that the model\\nconcentrates all syllable\\/word information into the first few corresponding frames, which is suboptimal\\nfor predicting token alignment and word ends. Since current evaluation metrics only use word starts,\\nthis weakness remains hidden.\\n2.1\\nMulti-Loss\\nWe propose to use a multi-loss approach. Most lyrics alignment models are trained with a CTC loss,\\nwhile [15] use a contrastive loss. To explore potential synergies, we added a linear layer to the audio\\nencoder to obtain a posteriorgram, i.e., a frame-wise distribution over symbols, in addition to the\\nframe embeddings. We train the model using a linear combination of contrastive and CTC loss.\\n2.2\\nBox Loss\\nWhile the contrastive objective encourages the model to distinguish whether a token is present within\\nan audio segment, it does not provide guidance on the temporal location of positive tokens. To address\\nthis limitation, we propose a novel box loss that incorporates timestamp information directly into\\nthe contrastive loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance where such information\\nis used within the loss rather than only for generating training samples. Specifically, we take the\\nmaximum over the frames where the token appears according to the timestamps, rather than over\\nthe entire audio segment as in Eq. 1, see Fig. 2; to account for potentially noisy timestamps in the\\ntraining dataset, we introduce a slack hyperparameter to widen the box. That is, we redefine the m\\nfunction for positive symbols s as follows\\nm(X, s) = maxt\\u2208[ts\\nstart\\u2212\\u03b6,ts\\nend+\\u03b6]fl(s) \\u00b7 fa(X)\\u22a4\\nt ,\\n(2)\\nwhere ts\\nstart, ts\\nend are the start and end frames of symbol s, and \\u03b6 is the slack hyperparameter.\\nIn addition, we explore a variant of the box loss, termed negative box loss, which eliminates the\\nneed for negative sampling and instead designates tokens appearing only once within a segment as\\nnegatives outside their defined box. Formally, the objective is\\nL = E(X,s+)\\u223cpd\\n\\u0002\\n(m(X, s+) \\u22121)2 + m\\u2212(X, s+)2\\u0003\\n,\\n(3)\\nwhere m is defined as above and\\nm\\u2212(X, s) = maxt\\u2208[1,ts\\nstart\\u2212\\u03b6)\\u222a(ts\\nend+\\u03b6,T ]fl(s) \\u00b7 fa(X)\\u22a4\\nt\\n(4)\\nif s is unique within X and 0 otherwise.\\n3\\nFigure 2: The box loss. The maximum similarity of a lyrics token is taken withing the corresponding\\nbox and not the entire audio segment. To account for noisy timestamps, a slack hyperparameter\\nwidens the box (in light blue).\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Language models (LMs) such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) have shown impressive abilities in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, relying solely on their parameters to encode a wealth of world knowledge requires a prohibitively large number of parameters and hence massive compute, and they often struggle to learn long-rail knowledge (Roberts et al., 2020; Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2022). Moreover, these parametric LMs are fundamentally incapable of adapting over time (De Cao et al., 2021; Lazaridou et al., 2021; Kasai et al., 2022), often hallucinate (Shuster et al., 2021), and may leak private data from the training corpus (Carlini et al., 2021). To overcome these limitations, there has been growing interest in retrieval-based LMs (Guu et al., 2020; Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2022b; Min et al., 2022), which incorporate a non-parametric datastore (e.g., text chunks from an external corpus) with their parametric counterparts. Retrieval-based LMs can outperform LMs without retrieval by a large margin with much fewer parameters (Mallen et al., 2022), can update their knowledge by replacing their retrieval corpora (Izacard et al., 2022b), and provide citations for users to easily verify and evaluate the predictions (Menick et al., 2022; Bohnet et al., 2022).\\nPreviously, retrieval and LMs have been studied mostly separately, and only recently researchers have integrated them and built systems in which retrieval and LMs interact more organically, and a number of retrieval-based LMs have been proposed due to growing interest. They differ in their neural architectures (e.g., the granularity of retrieval units, how to integrate retrieved information), learning algorithms, and different uses in downstream applications. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a comprehensive and coherent overview of recent advances in retrieval-based LMs. We will start by frst providing preliminaries covering the foundations of LM (e.g., masked LMs, autoregressive LMs) and retrieval systems (e.g., nearest-neighbor search methods widely used in neural retrieval systems; Karpukhin et al. 2020). We will then focus on recent progress in architectures, learning approaches, and applications of retrieval-based LMs.\\n\\nA taxonomy of architectures We introduce a taxonomy of architectures of retrieval-based LMs based on a variety of dimensions. Retrieval-based LMs can be categorized by the granularity of retrieved units stored in the datastore: either 1) a chunk of text (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2022b), or 2) a token (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022), or 3) an entity mention (F\\u00e9vry et al., 2020; de Jong et al., 2022). We also plan to cover techniques for refning data stores and improving similarity search (He et al., 2021; Alon et al., 2022). At the same time, retrieval-base LMs can be categorized based on how the retrieved information is integrated with the parametric encoder: 1) whether retrieved components are concatenated with the original input text (Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022b), 2) whether the retrieved components are latent and integrated into the intermediate layers of Transformers (de Jong et al., 2022; F\\u00e9vry et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), or 3) distribution of tokens from the retrieved components and the LMs are interpolated (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2022; Yogatama et al., 2021).\\nScalable learning algorithms Then, we discuss the training approaches of retrieval-based LMs. Since a retrieval datastore is typically very large, how to train retrieval-based LMs effectively and effciently remains challenging. We frst discuss pipelined approaches that train retrieval components and LMs separately, either through largescale pre-training (Izacard et al., 2022a) or multitask instruction tuning (Asai et al., 2022). Several other works train retrieval-based LMs with a fxed retrieval module (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Yogatama et al., 2021). We then discuss joint training under reasonable resource requirements: either through in-batch approximations to a full datastore, or updating the datastore with updated parameters asynchronously. The former uses fractions of the full corpus that are carefully designed during joint training (Zhong et al., 2022; de Jong et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022). The latter, on the other hand, aims to use full corpus during training with asynchronous index update for every certain time steps (Izacard et al., 2022b; Guu et al., 2020).\\n\\nAdaption to downstream tasks After discussing the basic building blocks of retrieval-based LMs, we show how retrieval-based LMs are adapted to downstream applications. We frst briefy summarize the two approaches to adapt a model to a new task: zero-shot or few-shot prompting without any parameter updates (Shi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022), and fne-tuning on target task data (Lewis et al., 2020). We then discuss methods designed to build more powerful retrieval-based LMs for certain downstream tasks, such as dialogue (Shuster et al., 2021), semantic parsing (Pasupat et al., 2021), and machine translation (Khandelwal et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021).\\nUp to this point, our tutorial has mainly focused on retrieving and integrating English plain text. At this end, we will cover recent extensions of retrieval-based LMs beyond English text, including multilingual (Asai et al., 2021), multimodal (Chen et al., 2022; Yasunaga et al., 2022) and code (Parvez et al., 2021) retrieval. These works often extend dense retrieval models to enable retrieval between heterogeneous input spaces (e.g., cross-lingual, cross-modal) and have shown that referring retrieved knowledge leads to knowledgeintensive generation.\\nFinally, we will use an exercise to showcase the effectiveness of retrieval-based LMs. We conclude our tutorial by discussing several important questions and future directions, including (1) how we can further improve the scalability of retrievalbased LMs without sacrifcing performance, (2) when retrieval-based LMs are particularly useful in the era of rapidly evolving LMs, and (3) what is necessary to enable applications of retrieval-based LMs for more diverse domains.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Preliminaries of Non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs)\\nIn this section, we provide an overview of Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) [7, 6, 35] for\\nimage generation. NATs operate with a pre-trained VQ-Autoencoder [71, 57, 13], which maps images\\nto discrete visual tokens and reconstructs images from these tokens. The VQ-Autoencoder consists of\\nthree components: an encoder EVQ, a quantizer Q with a learnable codebook e, and a decoder DVQ.\\nThe encoder and quantizer transform an image into a sequence of visual tokens:\\nv = Q(EVQ(x)),\\n(1)\\nwhere v = [vi]i=1:N is the sequence of visual tokens, and N is the sequence length. Each token vi\\ncorresponds to a specific entry in the VQ-Autoencoder codebook. The above process is known as\\ntokenization. After tokenization, NATs learn to generate visual tokens in the latent VQ space.\\nDuring training, NATs optimize the masked language modeling (MLM) objective [9]. Specifically, a\\nrandom subset of tokens is replaced with a special [MASK] token, and the model is trained to predict\\nthe original tokens based on the unmasked ones. Formally, let M be the mask vector, where mi = 1\\nindicates the i-th token is masked. The training objective minimizes the negative log-likelihood of\\nthe masked tokens:\\nLMLM = \\u2212\\nX\\ni\\u2208[1,N],mi=1\\nlog p(vi|v \\u00af\\nM),\\n(2)\\nwhere p(vi|v \\u00af\\nM) is the predicted probability of token vi given the unmasked tokens v \\u00af\\nM.\\n3\\nTo generate images, NATs follow an iterative decoding strategy [7].

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Introduction\\nKnowledge graph (KG) is a powerful tool for representing and storing structured knowledge, with ap-\\nplications spanning a wide range of domains, such as question answering [1, 2, 3, 4], recommendation\\nsystems [5, 6, 7], drug discovery [8, 9, 10], and clinical prediction [11, 12, 13]. Constituted by entities\\nand relations, KGs form a graph structure where nodes denote entities and edges represent relations\\namong them. To facilitate efficient reasoning and knowledge discovery, knowledge graph embedding\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\n(KGE) methods [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] have emerged, aiming to derive low-dimensional\\nvector representations of entities and relations while preserving the graph\\u2019s structural integrity.\\nWhile current KGE methods have shown success, many are limited to the graph structure alone,\\nneglecting the wealth of open-world knowledge surrounding entities not explicitly depicted in the\\nKG, which is manually created in most cases. This oversight inhibits their capacity to grasp the\\ncomplete semantics of entities and relations, consequently resulting in suboptimal performance across\\ndownstream tasks. For instance, a KG might contain entities such as \\u201cAlbert Einstein\\u201d and \\u201cTheory\\nof Relativity\\u201d, along with a relation connecting them. However, the KG may lack the rich context\\nand background information about Einstein\\u2019s life, his other scientific contributions, and the broader\\nimpact of his work. In contrast, pre-trained language models (PLMs) and LLMs, having been trained\\non extensive literature, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of Einstein and his legacy\\nbeyond the limited scope of the KG. While recent studies have explored fine-tuning PLMs with KG\\ntriples [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], this approach is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the\\ntraining and inference processes are computationally expensive due to the large number of parameters\\nin PLMs, making it challenging to extend to more knowledgeable LLMs. Secondly, the fine-tuned\\nPLMs heavily rely on the restricted knowledge captured by the KG embeddings, limiting their ability\\nto fully leverage the extensive knowledge contained within the language models themselves. As\\na result, these approaches may not adequately capitalize on the potential of LLMs to enhance KG\\nrepresentations, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Lastly, small-scale PLMs (e.g., BERT) contain outdated and\\nlimited knowledge compared to modern LLMs, requiring re-training to incorporate new information,\\nwhich hinders their ability to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of today\\u2019s language models.\\nTo address the limitations of current approaches, we propose KG-FIT (Knowledge Graph FIne-\\nTuning), a novel framework that directly incorporates the rich knowledge from LLMs into KG\\nembeddings without the need for fine-tuning the LMs themselves. The term \\u201cfine-tuning\\u201d is used\\nbecause the initial entity embeddings are from pre-trained LLMs, initially capturing global semantics.\\nKG-FIT employs a two-stage approach: (1) generating entity descriptions from the LLM and per-\\nforming LLM-guided hierarchy construction to build a semantically coherent hierarchical structure of\\nentities, and (2) fine-tuning the KG embeddings by integrating knowledge from both the hierarchical\\nstructure and textual embeddings, effectively merging the open-world knowledge captured by the\\nLLM into the KG embeddings. This results in enriched representations that integrate both global\\nknowledge from LLMs and local knowledge from KGs.\\nThe main contributions of KG-FIT are outlined as follows:\\n(1) We introduce a method for automatically constructing a semantically coherent entity hierarchy\\nusing agglomerative clustering and LLM-guided refinement.\\n(2) We propose a fine-tuning approach that integrates knowledge from the hierarchical structure and\\npre-trained text embeddings of entities, enhancing KG embeddings by incorporating open-world\\nknowledge captured by the LLM.\\n(3) Through an extensive empirical study on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate significant im-\\nprovements in link prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nStructure-Based Knowledge Graph Embedding.
