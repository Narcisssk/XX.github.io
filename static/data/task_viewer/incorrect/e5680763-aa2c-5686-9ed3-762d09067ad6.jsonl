{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Introduction and Formal Framework\",\"section_content\":\"Introduction and Formal Framework\\nScientists often aim to produce causal models of the world that balance informativeness with compres-\\nsion. That is, they aim to model data-generating processes in a way that captures as much information\\nabout those processes as possible, while omitting cumbersome or unnecessary details. For example,\\nepidemiologists might produce a model of cancer rates in a population that treats smoking as a binary\\nvariable representing whether or not a person smokes cigarettes, but without specifying the average\\nnumber of cigarettes the person smokes per day, and omitting additional background variables such\\nas the person\\u2019s blood type. Ordinary agents face an analogous challenge: when representing the\\nsocial and physical world around us, each of us must determine which variables to include in our\\ncausal models, and at what level of granularity. For example, a causal model of a toddler\\u2019s tantrums\\ncould include whether they napped or not as a binary variable, or a finer-grained specification of the\\nnumber of minutes they napped; it could include the time of day, or omit this variable entirely. Any\\nsuch choice of variables instantiates a particular trade-off between informativeness and compression.\\nHow do people navigate this choice in building causal models of the world?\\nTo formalize this trade-off, we begin by using Bayesian networks to represent causal structure. Let\\nVP be a set of random variables that are all measurable with respect to the same probability space\\nP = (\\u2126, \\u03a3, p). Let E be an acyclic set of ordered pairs, or edges, relating the variables in E. The set\\nof edges E allows us to define parent and descendant relations between variables in the obvious way.\\nA causal Bayes net is a pair GP = (VP, E) such that: i) according to the probability distribution p,\\nall elements of VP are independent of their non-descendants, conditional on their parents (Markov\\nCondition), ii) there is no set of edges E\\u2217\\u2282E such that (VP, E\\u2217) satisfies the Markov condition\\naccording to the probability distribution p (Minimality Condition), and iii) no variable in VP is a\\ncoarsening of or identical to any other variable in VP (Co-possibility Condition).\\nFor any variable set VP = {V1, . . . , Vn}, let VP(\\u03c9) be the vector [V1(\\u03c9), . . . , Vn(\\u03c9)]. This allows us\\nto define an equivalence relation \\u223cVP such that \\u03c9 \\u223cVP \\u03c9\\u2032 iff VP(\\u03c9) = VP(\\u03c9\\u2032). A compression of\\na causal Bayes net GP = (VP, E) is any causal Bayes net \\u02c6\\nGP = (\\u02c6\\nVP, \\u02c6\\nE) that: i) satisfies the Markov,\\nMinimality, and Co-possibility conditions according to P; ii) is such that for any \\u03c9, \\u03c9\\u2032 \\u2208\\u2126, if\\nInformation-Theoretic Principles in Cognitive Systems Workshop at the 37th Conference on Neural Information\\nProcessing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\\n\\u03c9 \\u223cVP \\u03c9\\u2032, then \\u03c9 \\u223c\\u02c6\\nVP \\u03c9\\u2032; and iii) there exists a pair \\u03c9, \\u03c9\\u2032 \\u2208\\u2126, such that \\u03c9 \\u0338\\u223cVP \\u03c9\\u2032 but \\u03c9 \\u223c\\u02c6\\nVP \\u03c9\\u2032.\\nIn other words, a compression of a causal Bayes net is a second causal Bayes net that satisfies the\\nnecessary criteria for representing the same target system as the first, while also defining a strictly\\nmore general partition over possibility space. The compression-of relation between causal Bayes\\nnets defines a lexical ordering between causal representations of the same target system, such that\\nwhile we cannot definitively say, for any two causal Bayes nets, which is more compressed, we can\\nsometimes say of two Bayes nets that one is more compressed than the other (namely, when one is a\\ncompression of the other).\\nNext, we define the degree to which a set of variables C is informative about an effect variable E,\\nwhere both variables are embedded in a causal Bayes net GP . We begin by noting that for given\\ncausal Bayes net GP, we can calculate the probability distribution over any variable V in the set VP,\\ngiven an intervention setting some set of variables X to some set of values x (denoted do(x)), using\\nthe following formula (Pearl [2000]):\\npGP(v|do(x)) =\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\np(v| parGP(V ))\\nif V \\u0338\\u2208X\\n1\\nif V \\u2208X and v is consistent with x\\n0\\notherwise\\n(1)\\nwhere parGP(V ) denotes the values taken by the parents of V in GP. This allows us to derive the\\nprobability distribution that would be defined over any variable in the causal Bayes net if any other\\nvariable were set to some value via an exogenous, \\u201csurgical\\u201d intervention on the data-generating\\nsystem. This, in turn, allows us to define the causal mutual information between a set of causal\\nvariables C and an effect variable E, where both variables are embedded in a causal Bayes net GP :\\nCMI(C, E, GP ) =\\nX\\nc,e\\nq(c)p(e|do(c)) log2\\np(e|do(c))\\np(e)\\n,\\n(2)\\nwhere q is a distribution over possible interventions on C (see Ay and Polani [2008] and Pearl [1994]\\nfor a similar deployment of a distribution over interventions).\\nSuppose that a causal Bayes net \\u02c6\\nGP is a compression of some other causal Bayes net GP. Both Bayes\\nnets contain an effect variable E, but may contain different causal variables C and \\u02c6\\nC. The amount of\\ninformation about E that is lost as a result of replacing the less-compressed causal Bayes net with a\\nmore compressed alternative is given by the equation:\\nL(GP, \\u02c6\\nGP, C, \\u02c6\\nC, E) = CMI(C, E, GP ) \\u2212CMI( \\u02c6\\nC, E, \\u02c6\\nGP ).\\n(3)\\nThis quantity is non-negative whenever the variable set \\u02c6\\nC defines a strictly more general equivalence\\nclass on \\u2126than C, and only takes the value zero in the case where compression does not result\\nin any change in the informativeness of the casual variables with respect to the effect variable of\\ninterest. We hypothesized that as more information is lost due to compression (as measured by the\\nfunction defined in Eq. 3), participants will evaluate claims consistent with the more compressed\\nrepresentation less positively relative to claims consistent with the less compressed representation.\\nIn what follows, we present an experiment confirming this hypothesis. Two further experiments,\\nwhich in addition rule out alternative explanations of our findings, are reported in the supplemental\\nmaterials.\\n1.1\\nPrevious Work\\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the work that is closest to our framework consists of previous attempts\\nto quantify properties of causal relationships in Bayesian networks using tools from information\\ntheory. These include specific attempts to measure various aspects of causal relationships, such as:\\nproportionality, stability, power, abstraction, strength, or specificity using formalism from information\\ntheory Pocheville et al. [2017], Korb et al. [2011], Griffiths et al. [2015], Hoel [2017], Beckers and\\nHalpern [2019], Bourrat [2021]. However, none of these approaches aim, as we do, to provide a\\nunified account of our preference for more or less compressed causal representations in terms of\\ninformation loss.\\n2\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Experiment 1\",\"section_content\":\"Experiment 1\\nWe presented participants with a description of the results of controlled experiments on a fictional\\nvariety of mushroom, fly, or rock, and asked them to rate how good it would be to include various\\nclaims in a summary of the described results. These claims included more and less compressed\\ncausal claims. We manipulated the vignette used, the amount of information loss realized by the more\\ncompressed causal claim, and whether the compression was achieved by coarse-graining a single\\nvariable or removing a background variable from the representation.\\n2.1\\nParticipants\\nParticipants were 450 adults recruited via Prolific. 150 additional participants were excluded for\\nfailing comprehension checks or for rating poor causal claims non-negatively. For both studies,\\nparticipation was restricted to users with a US-based IP address and a 95% rating based on at least\\n100 previous studies. Both studies were pre-registered, and IRB approval was obtained from the\\nauthors\\u2019 university.

For example, in the insect vignette, participants were presented\\nwith the following four facts resulting from experiments on the \\u201cBricofly\\u201d insect: a) x% of all Bricofly\\nlarvae raised in a warm, humid tank developed blue wings; b) 70% of all Bricofly larvae raised in\\na warm, dry tank developed blue wings; c) 1% of all Bricofly larvae raised in a cold, humid tank\\ndeveloped blue wings; d) 1% of all Bricofly larvae raised in a cold, dry tank developed blue wings.\\nThe value of x was varied between subjects and set at either 70, 85, or 98. Participants were then\\nasked to rate, on a scale from -3 (very bad) to 3 (very good), how good it would be to include each of\\nthe following statements in a summary of the findings of the descriptions given above:\\n\\u2022 Compressed: Raising Bricofly larvae in a warm tank causes them to develop blue wings.\\n\\u2022 High: Raising Bricofly larvae in a warm, humid tank causes them to develop blue wings.\\n\\u2022 Low: Raising Bricofly larvae in a warm, dry tank causes them to develop blue wings.\\nThe values of x correspond to information loss amounts for Compressed of 0, .01, and .06 respectively,\\nassuming a uniform distribution over possible interventions. Participants were randomly assigned\\nto one of eighteen possible conditions, which differed with respect to which of the three vignettes\\nthey were shown, whether they were asked to evaluate a compressed claim achieved by coarsening\\na causal variable or eliding a background variable, and the amount of information loss inherent in\\ncompression. Finally, participants were also asked to evaluate three poor causal claims, constructed\\nby substituting the value of the primary causal factor (e.g., changing the warm tank to a cold tank).\\nThese were included to help anchor the scale and verify participant understanding; we do not discuss\\nthem further here in the interest of space.\\n2.3\\nResults\\nTo test whether evaluation of less compressed causal claims relative to more compressed causal claims\\nincreased as a function of information loss due to compression, we computed (as pre-registered) two\\ndifference scores:\\n\\u2022 V-A. The difference between the participant\\u2019s evaluation of Compressed and their evaluation\\nof High (e.g., the difference between the evaluation of \\u2018Raising Bricofly larvae in a warm\\ntank causes them to develop blue wings\\u2019 and the evaluation of \\u2018Raising Bricofly larvae in a\\nwarm, humid tank causes them to develop blue wings\\u2019).\\n\\u2022 V-B.

The regressions revealed that only Loss was a significant predictor of V-A\\n(\\u03b2 = \\u221216.623, p < .001) and V-B (\\u03b2 = \\u22129.852, p < .001). As a sanity check, we also analyzed\\nthe difference between the participant\\u2019s evaluation of High and their evaluation of Low (V-C). As\\nexpected, only Loss was a significant predictor of V-C, with the value of V-C increasing as the\\nprobability of the effect given the description of the cause in High increases with Loss (\\u03b2 = 13.543,\\np < .001). In an exploratory analysis, we measured the percentage of participants who strictly\\npreferred Compressed to High across all three loss levels. This percentage was approximately 36%\\nwhen Loss=0, 21% when Loss=.01, and 10% when Loss=.06.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Discussion and Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"Discussion and Conclusion\\nThese results provide strong evidence in favor of the claim that participants\\u2019 relative evaluations of\\nmore and less compressed causal claims are partially governed by the amount of information loss that\\nis inherent in the more compressed causal claim. As can be seen in Fig. 1, which plots participants\\u2019\\nabsolute evaluations of each causal claim at each loss level, when there is no information loss,\\nparticipants evaluate more compressed causal claims significantly more highly than less compressed\\ncausal claims, suggesting that people award simplicity and penalize unnecessary complexity in their\\nevaluation of causal claims. When information loss is moderate, there is no significant difference\\nbetween participants\\u2019 evaluations of more and less compressed causal claims, suggesting that some\\nparticipants prefer a compressed claim even when some information loss is inherent. That is, they are\\ntolerant of some amount of lossy compression in the causal representation of their environment. In\\nthe supplemental materials, we report results from two further experiments. These results lend further\\nconfirmation to our hypothesis, while also ruling out alternative explanations due to Cheng [1997]\\nand Lien and Cheng [2000].
