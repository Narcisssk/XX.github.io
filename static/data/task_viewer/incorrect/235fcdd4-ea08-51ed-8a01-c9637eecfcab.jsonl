{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Researchers are increasingly focusing on extending these unimodal LLMs to multimodal\\nLLMs, particularly Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), leveraging vision encoders designed to tackle information-rich visual tasks (Radford et al., 2021a; Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a; Alayrac et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b; Driess et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023).\\nTo evaluate LVLMs, various downstream tasks have been employed, such as image captioning, visual dialogue, grounding, reasoning, and question generation. Although LVLMs demonstrate impressive results in these tasks, a recent study (Liu et al., 2023b) argued that LVLMs exhibit limitations when dealing with visual tasks on text-rich images, leading to reduced applicability in real-world applications, such as Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA). Document VQA tasks require the comprehensive analysis of multiple types of information, including text, objects (e.g., fgures or charts), and layout. However, existing LVLMs struggle to deliver satisfactory solutions due to their limited ability to extract fnegrained features from images, as shown in Figure 1.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce Cream, Contrastive reading model, specifcally designed to effectively overcome these limitations. Cream features a streamlined and practical architecture that seamlessly integrates a general-vision encoder with auxiliary encoders and novel training techniques. In addition to a primary vision encoder for overall visual feature extraction from document images, Cream employs auxiliary encoders\\u2014such as OCR and object detectors\\u2014for text and object-specifc feature extraction. Cream handles fne-grained features without missing image details while understanding the visual context. When combined with LLMs, Cream overcomes the limitations of LVLMs and achieves robust performance on text-rich images. To further enhance the model, we propose a contrastive feature alignment method to balance disparities between the vision and auxiliary features extracted from each encoder during training.\\nWe conduct extensive experiments on challenging text-rich Document VQA benchmarks. We perform experiments on two models: our standalone Cream model and a model that combines our Cream model with frozen LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that standalone Cream achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art in tasks that necessitate the extraction of specifc text information from document images. Furthermore, we observe that when combined with LLMs, Cream demonstrates robust performance in Visual Document Understanding (VDU) tasks, which are challenging for existing LVLMs. Lastly, we will open-source Cream\\u2019s codebase and the newly built VQA datasets to foster further research and innovation in the feld of visual document understanding.\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 We present a novel neural architecture and associated model training techniques tailored for text-rich image understanding tasks, highlighting improved performance across challenging\\nVDU tasks.   \\n\\u2022 We suggest a contrastive learning-based training technique to improve performance and enhance robustness.   \\n\\u2022 We offer an accessible approach that allows for integrating the proposed model into LLMs, thus expanding the versatility of LLMs in multimodal domains by providing rich visual information.   \\n\\u2022 We demonstrate the proposed method\\u2019s superior performance on challenging text-rich VDU benchmarks via rigorous experiments.   \\n\\u2022 We contribute valuable resources to facilitate ongoing research and development in VDU tasks by sharing our codebase and newlygenerated datasets.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.1 Applying LLMs to Visually-Situated NLU\",\"section_content\":\"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various applications (Rae et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023), demonstrating their ability to generate responses in accordance with user intent (Ouyang et al., 2022; Shahriar and Hayawi, 2023). Researchers have explored the use of LLMs in tasks related to visual understanding (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Ye et al., 2023); however, their application in visually-situated natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, such as question answering on text-rich document images, remains limited. Previous approaches have attempted to integrate visual embeddings or OCR tokens into LLMs to address this gap (Li et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). However, these methods suffer from ineffciency, as they require numerous LLM tokens and entail considerable computational overhead. For instance, documents in DocVQA (Tito et al., 2021) consume an average of 400 and a maximum of nearly 3K OCR tokens. To overcome these obstacles, we propose the integration of Cream, which imparts language-image understanding capabilities to LLMs using soft visual prompts with a fxed size. This integration has the potential to enhance the effciency and accuracy of LLMs in visually-situated NLU tasks.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 Visual Document Understanding\",\"section_content\":\"Visually-situated NLU blends computer vision and NLU techniques to accurately analyze visual data through language. Early approaches emphasized OCR and leveraged extracted text for contextual analysis (Xu et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2022). Some contemporary methods directly processed document images, circumventing the need for external OCR models (Kim et al., 2022; Davis et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022), while others leveraged both image and OCR-extracted text for improved performances (Kil et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022; Appalaraju et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). LayoutLMv3 (Huang et al., 2022) introduces the word-patch alignment technique, which classifes the relationship between text and corresponding image patches. UDOP (Tang et al., 2022) employs a unifed encoder that handles both image and text features, transforming the information from both modalities into vision-text embeddings by summing the image patch and text features. This strategy ensures alignment between modalities, such as image patches, tokens, and layout information, by fusing multimodal features within a single encoder. In contrast, Cream extracts fne-grained, aligned multimodal features through contrastive learning (CL), eliminating the need for the fusion encoder. The CL approach prevents over-fusion of information from each modality, allowing the decoder to effectively utilize the multimodal semantics inherent in visually-rich documents. Moreover, due to this architectural design, Cream exhibits enhanced robustness to OCR errors.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Method\",\"section_content\":\"Our goal is to develop a system that accurately answers natural language questions based on specifc evidence in an input image.

A comprehensive overview of the entire pipeline is depicted in Figure 2.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1.1 Architecture\",\"section_content\":\"Cream is composed of two encoders and one decoder. The vision encoder computes vector representations of the input image patches. Concurrently, feature evidence, such as text or general object information in target images, is extracted in text format and encoded by an auxiliary text encoder. The embeddings from both encoders are then aligned using our proposed CL scheme (see Figure 2). The aligned features undergo further processing by the decoder to extract necessary information. Additional details will be provided in the sections that follow.\\nVision Encoder The vision encoder converts the input image $\\\\mathbf{x}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbb{R}^{H\\\\times W\\\\times C}$ into embeddings $\\\\{\\\\mathbf{z}_{i}|\\\\mathbf{z}_{i}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbb{R}^{d},1{\\\\leqslant}i{\\\\leqslant}n\\\\}$ , where $n$ is the feature map size or the number of image patches, and $d$ is the dimension of the output vectors. We can use CNNbased models (He et al., 2016) or Transformerbased models (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) as the encoder network. In this study, we employ Vision Transformer (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) with a 2D absolute position encoding ( $\\\\mathrm{Xu}$ et al., 2020) and a variable-resolution mechanism (Lee et al., 2022) to simplify the process. The variableresolution mechanism ensures a constant number of patches without distorting the original image aspect ratio.\\nAuxiliary Encoder The auxiliary encoder encodes the extracted feature evidence, such as OCR boxes and general object boxes, into embeddings $\\\\{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{i}|\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{i}{\\\\in}\\\\mathbb{R}^{d},1{\\\\leqslant}i{\\\\leqslant}\\\\hat{n}\\\\}$ , where $\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{n}}$ is the maximum sequence length of the encoder. In Figure 3, the feature evidence is converted into token embeddings using the recognized text for the OCR boxes and the recognized semantic object label for the general object boxes. A type embedding is added to differentiate between OCR and general object boxes, and a 2D absolute position encoding is applied for encoding the location information. We employ the encoder of BART (Lewis et al., 2020) as the Auxiliary Encoder.\\nDecoder We employ BART decoder, which takes the output embeddings of the encoders $\\\\{\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},...,\\\\mathbf{z}_{n},\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{1},...,\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{\\\\hat{n}}\\\\}$ and generates a sequence $\\\\mathbf{h}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times d}$ , where $m$ is the length to generate. The generated hidden states are utilized in two scenarios.

(ii) When integrated with an LLM, the hidden states are linearly mapped to be used as a soft visual prompt that combines Cream\\u2019s visual understanding capabilities with the LLM\\u2019s language processing abilities: $\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\,\\\\mathbf{h}\\\\mathbf{U}$ , where $\\\\mathbf{U}\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times d^{\\\\prime}}$ and $d^{\\\\prime}$ is the\\nLLM\\u2019s input dimension. In both scenarios, we use a language modeling (LM) loss, where the model generates a target sequence of token embeddings conditioned on the image. The details of the training objective will be explained in Section 3.3.3.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1.2 Contrastive Feature Alignment\",\"section_content\":\"To enhance the understanding of texts and objects in images, we introduce an auxiliary encoder alongside the vision encoder (Figure 2). It is critical to note that alignment of features from these distinct encoders within a shared space is not guaranteed. As observed in our analysis in Section 4, the encoded information often suffers from misalignment, leading to a model performance degradation. To address this challenge, we introduce an effcient and simple CL strategy during the model training phase. This strategy is employed to guarantee the alignment of feature embeddings, which in turn, enhances the overall performance of the model.\\nAs shown in Figure 3, we utilize detectors to obtain feature evidence (e.g., texts and objects) and encode their box coordinates and text labels into vector representations. We assume that an image patch can physically overlap with certain boxes, implying that the visual patch embedding should encompass semantically relevant information similar to its corresponding auxiliary information. Given this presumption, we establish the positive relations between a visual patch embedding and its corresponding embeddings from the auxiliary encoder, while considering all other relationships as negative pairs. Our CL approach differs from conventional image-level CL methods like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021b) as our method accommodates more pairwise relations within an image, leveraging multiple available feature evidence.\\n\\nFor CL, we use a 2-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) $\\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\theta}\\\\,:\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\,\\\\mapsto\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\\\ast}}$ , where $d^{*}$ is a hyperparameter for a dimension of a common space. Most settings are similar to those of Khosla et al. (2020). More specifc details are provided in Appendix A.4.1. The CL objective can be expressed as follows:\\nwhere the sets $\\\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\\\{\\\\mathbf{v}_{i}|\\\\mathbf{v}_{i}}&{{}\\\\in}&{\\\\{\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},...,\\\\mathbf{z}_{n}\\\\},1\\\\quad\\\\leqslant}\\\\end{array}$ $i\\\\ \\\\ \\\\leqslant\\\\ l\\\\}$ and $\\\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\\\{\\\\mathbf{v}_{j}|\\\\mathbf{v}_{j}}&{{}\\\\in}&{\\\\{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{1},...,\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{\\\\hat{n}}\\\\},l\\\\ +\\\\ 1\\\\ \\\\leqslant}\\\\end{array}$ $j\\\\ \\\\leqslant\\\\ 2l\\\\}$ are uniformly sampled from all positive pairs in $\\\\{\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},...,\\\\mathbf{z}_{n},\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{1},...,\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}_{\\\\hat{n}}\\\\}$ . We refer $A(i,j)$ as $\\\\left\\\\{1,...,2l\\\\right\\\\}\\\\backslash\\\\{i,j\\\\}$ . The denominator accumulates the similarity scores over all negative pairs. The function $s(\\\\mathbf x,\\\\mathbf y)$ is defned as $s(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y})\\\\mathbf{\\\\eta}=\\\\mathbf{\\\\eta}\\\\exp(\\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}}(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}}(\\\\mathbf{y}))\\/\\\\tau)$ , where $\\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathbf{y}))$ denotes computing the cosine similarity between its vector inputs, with MLP parameterized by $\\\\theta$ . The $\\\\tau$ is the temperature parameter that modulates the softmax sharpness. The proposed CL encourages the alignment of embeddings from both encoders in the feature space, resulting in performance improvement.

Specifically, for\\nImageNet-based benchmarks like ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, we compare the distribution of\\nnearest-neighbor similarities stest,i to LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train. We have already seen in\\nFig. 1 that compared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M seemed stylistically and semantically much\\nmore similar to ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, while the effect was reversed for ImageNet-Val.\\nUsing the notion of perceptual nearest-neighbor similarity, we can now fully capture the difference in\\nsimilarity in a principled manner. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, where we can now clearly observe that\\ncompared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M is indeed overall more similar to ImageNet-Sketch and\\nImageNet-R. We show additional histograms for other test sets in Apps. B and D.\\nMoreover, in Appx. A.2, we detail how many training samples in LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train\\nare near duplicates (duplicates up to small shifts or crops) of the test sets. While we found 3.1 % of\\nImageNet-Sketch images to have duplicates in LAION-400M, there are only 0.04 % ImageNet-Sketch\\nduplicates in ImageNet-Train. On the other hand, ImageNet-Train contains duplicates of 2.67 %\\nImageNet-Val images as opposed to just 0.14 % ImageNet-Val images in LAION-400M.\\nLAION-400M-trained CLIP has been reported to outperform ImageNet-trained methods on ImageNet-\\nSketch and ImageNet-R, while underperforming on ImageNet-Val (see Tab. 1). In light of the above\\nobservation, this could well be explained not by LAION-400M\\u2019s general scale and diversity but\\nspecifically by its fraction of training samples whose nearest-neighbor similarity to the test set\\nsurpasses that of any sample in ImageNet-Train.

A larger, denser, more diverse dataset likely\\ncontains samples more similar to given test points than a smaller, sparser one. To control for this,\\nwe compute the nearest-neighbor similarity of each test point to the smaller dataset (left) and prune\\npoints from the larger dataset that lie within this hull (center). We end up with a corrected large\\ndataset replicating the similarity gap of the small one (right).\\nfollowing section formalizes this concept and explains how we can refine the similarity-based pruning\\nfrom Sec. 4.2 to quantify their impact on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance.\\n4.4\\nSIMILARITY GAP AND HIGHLY SIMILAR IMAGES\\nSecs. 4.2 and 4.3 provide direct and indirect evidence that CLIP\\u2019s performance on common ImageNet-\\nbased benchmarks might mainly stem from images in its training set that are highly similar to the test\\nsets. We now formalize this notion and describe how to systematically test our hypothesis. To this\\nend, we note that even for ImageNet-Train, the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i differs across test\\nsamples. Our goal is to prune LAION-400M so that the pruned dataset replicates the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities stest,i of ImageNet-Train.\\nLet us consider that we now have two training datasets, denoted as DS (small, like ImageNet-Train)\\nand DL (large, like LAION-400M), and still use a test dataset T (like ImageNet-Sketch). For the\\nsake of simplicity, we assume that DS is a subset of DL. We choose a similarity measure s as in\\nSec. 4.2. We collect all nearest-neighbor similarities stest,i (recall Eq. 3) in the set\\nS(D, T ) =\\n\\b\\nstest,i(D, T ) | i \\u2208\\n\\u0002\\n1, |T |\\n\\u0003\\t\\n(4)\\nwhich we term similarity gap. We can think of this set as a full characterization of the training set\\u2019s\\nsimilarity to any point in the test set; compare Fig. 5.\\nBased on the assumption that the large dataset contains all samples from the small dataset, it follows\\nthat si(DS) \\u2264si(DL). In other words, the nearest-neighbor similarity to samples in the small\\ntraining set is always smaller than or equal to the similarity to samples in the large training set.\\nConsequently, on a per-sample basis, S(DL, T ) is strictly larger than S(DS, T ), i.e., the large dataset\\nis generally more similar to the test than the small dataset. We aim to identify a maximally large\\nsubset \\u02dc\\nDL \\u2286DL of the large training set, such that its similarity gap S( \\u02dc\\nDL, T ) is equal to the\\nsimilarity gap S(DS, T ) of the small dataset (on a per-sample basis, meaning si( \\u02dc\\nDS) = si(DS) for\\nall samples). To achieve this, we examine each test sample ti and remove any sample x \\u2208DL for\\nwhich the similarity s(ti, x) > si(DS). We illustrate this procedure in Fig. 5.\\nThis method allows us to surgically remove highly similar images with respect to a given test set and\\nreference training set. Compared to the unconstrained pruning in Sec. 4.2, this will remove far less\\nsamples from LAION-400M, and thus allows us to isolate the impact of highly similar images.\\n5\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

To control for this,\\nwe compute the nearest-neighbor similarity of each test point to the smaller dataset (left) and prune\\npoints from the larger dataset that lie within this hull (center). We end up with a corrected large\\ndataset replicating the similarity gap of the small one (right).\\nfollowing section formalizes this concept and explains how we can refine the similarity-based pruning\\nfrom Sec. 4.2 to quantify their impact on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance.\\n4.4\\nSIMILARITY GAP AND HIGHLY SIMILAR IMAGES\\nSecs. 4.2 and 4.3 provide direct and indirect evidence that CLIP\\u2019s performance on common ImageNet-\\nbased benchmarks might mainly stem from images in its training set that are highly similar to the test\\nsets. We now formalize this notion and describe how to systematically test our hypothesis. To this\\nend, we note that even for ImageNet-Train, the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i differs across test\\nsamples. Our goal is to prune LAION-400M so that the pruned dataset replicates the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities stest,i of ImageNet-Train.\\nLet us consider that we now have two training datasets, denoted as DS (small, like ImageNet-Train)\\nand DL (large, like LAION-400M), and still use a test dataset T (like ImageNet-Sketch). For the\\nsake of simplicity, we assume that DS is a subset of DL. We choose a similarity measure s as in\\nSec. 4.2. We collect all nearest-neighbor similarities stest,i (recall Eq. 3) in the set\\nS(D, T ) =\\n\\b\\nstest,i(D, T ) | i \\u2208\\n\\u0002\\n1, |T |\\n\\u0003\\t\\n(4)\\nwhich we term similarity gap. We can think of this set as a full characterization of the training set\\u2019s\\nsimilarity to any point in the test set; compare Fig. 5.\\nBased on the assumption that the large dataset contains all samples from the small dataset, it follows\\nthat si(DS) \\u2264si(DL). In other words, the nearest-neighbor similarity to samples in the small\\ntraining set is always smaller than or equal to the similarity to samples in the large training set.\\nConsequently, on a per-sample basis, S(DL, T ) is strictly larger than S(DS, T ), i.e., the large dataset\\nis generally more similar to the test than the small dataset. We aim to identify a maximally large\\nsubset \\u02dc\\nDL \\u2286DL of the large training set, such that its similarity gap S( \\u02dc\\nDL, T ) is equal to the\\nsimilarity gap S(DS, T ) of the small dataset (on a per-sample basis, meaning si( \\u02dc\\nDS) = si(DS) for\\nall samples). To achieve this, we examine each test sample ti and remove any sample x \\u2208DL for\\nwhich the similarity s(ti, x) > si(DS). We illustrate this procedure in Fig. 5.\\nThis method allows us to surgically remove highly similar images with respect to a given test set and\\nreference training set. Compared to the unconstrained pruning in Sec. 4.2, this will remove far less\\nsamples from LAION-400M, and thus allows us to isolate the impact of highly similar images.\\n5\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"The similarity hypothesis\",\"section_content\":\"THE SIMILARITY HYPOTHESIS\\nThis section first illustrates how perceptual similarity can be quantified (Sec. 4.1). Based on this metric,\\nwe demonstrate that CLIP\\u2019s performance on a test set is strongly related to the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarity between LAION-400M and a test set (Sec. 4.2). Further, we show that nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities differ between LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train, which leads to the hypothesis that this\\ndifference explains CLIP\\u2019s high classification accuracy on ImageNet-based test sets (Sec. 4.3). Finally,\\nwe phrase this hypothesis in terms of highly similar images, which leaves us with an interventional\\nmethod to test this hypothesis (Sec. 4.4).\\n4.1\\nQUANTIFYING PERCEPTUAL SIMILARITY\\nAbbas et al. (2023) demonstrated that nearest neighbors in the image embedding space of CLIP\\nshare semantic and stylistic characteristics. We illustrate this in Fig. 2, where we plot samples\\nfrom ImageNet-Sketch and their nearest neighbors in LAION-400M for different similarity values.\\nVisually, the similarity scores correlate well with the closeness of the image pairs. This is corroborated\\nby other works that demonstrate high perceptual alignment between CLIP\\u2019s embedding similarity and\\nhuman perception (Fu et al., 2023), or using it to sample ImageNet-like images from a large dataset\\n(Gadre et al., 2023), or building a similarity-based classifier (Zhang et al., 2021).\\nWe follow these works and quantify perceptual similarity as the cosine similarity in CLIP ViT-B\\/16+\\u2019s\\nimage embedding space. App. E ablates the choice of the model used to compute this metric. We\\ndenote the similarity of two samples xi, xj \\u2208Rn as\\ns(xi, xj) : Rn \\u00d7 Rn \\u2192[\\u22121, 1].\\n(1)\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nFigure 3: Nearest-neighbor similarity is predictive of performance. Left: LAION-400M-trained\\nCLIP\\u2019s top-1 classification accuracy on test samples is highly correlated to their nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarity stest,i. Results are averaged over 0.05 similarity intervals. Center and right: Similarity-\\nbased pruning greatly impacts CLIP\\u2019s top-1 classification accuracy. We train a baseline model on\\nLAION-200M (see Sec. 3) and additional models on LAION-200M-splits created by random pruning,\\nnear-pruning (in order of decreasing similarity), and far-pruning (in order of increasing similarity).\\nCompared to training on \\u2018rand-pruned\\u2019 splits (solid blue curve), training on \\u2018near-pruned\\u2019 splits (solid\\nred curve) drastically decreases classification accuracy. Training on \\u2018far-pruned\\u2019 splits (dashed blue\\ncurve) impacts accuracy comparatively little.\\nWe now consider the relation between a training dataset D and a test set T . Using the similarity\\nmetric s, we can find the nearest neighbor in the test set for each training sample. This allows us to\\nassign each training sample xi \\u2208D the nearest-neighbor similarity\\nstrain,i(D, T ) = max\\nt\\u2208T s(t, xi).\\n(2)\\nIn the same way, we can assign each test sample ti \\u2208T the nearest-neighbor similarity\\nstest,i(D, T ) = max\\nx\\u2208D s(ti, x).\\n(3)\\n4.2\\nNEAREST-NEIGHBOR SIMILARITY DRIVES PERFORMANCE\\nWe can now examine the relationship between nearest-neighbor similarity and CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot\\nclassification performance.\\nFig. 3 (left) illustrates that the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i of test samples in ImageNet-Sketch,\\nImageNet-R, and ImageNet-Val to LAION-200M is a good predictor of CLIP\\u2019s top-1 accuracy on\\nthese samples. We observe a clear correlation between nearest-neighbor similarity and accuracy\\nacross datasets. For ImageNet-Sketch, for example, sketches without similar counterparts in LAION-\\n400M (similarity 0.38) are classified with 35 % accuracy, while sketches duplicated in LAION-400M\\n(similarity close to 1) reach up to 69 % accuracy. We show additional correlation plots for ImageNet-\\nbased test sets in App. B and for other test sets in App. D.\\nWe can observe the impact of nearest-neighbor similarity on classification performance more directly\\nby pruning samples from LAION-200M based on their nearest-neighbor similarity strain,i to a given\\ntest set, retraining CLIP, and evaluating its zero-shot classification performance on that test set. We\\ncompare three different pruning strategies: \\u2018near-pruning\\u2019 prunes in decreasing order of similarity\\n(pruning samples with high nearest-neighbor similarity first), \\u2018far-pruning\\u2019 prunes in increasing order\\nof similarity, and \\u2018rand-pruning\\u2019 prunes randomly irrespective of similarity. All strategies produce\\nLAION-200M-splits with 50M, 100M, and 150M pruned samples.\\nCLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance when trained on these splits is illustrated in Fig. 3 for\\nImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-Val. The \\u2018near-pruned\\u2019 accuracy curve drops much quicker with\\ndecreasing dataset size than the \\u2018rand-pruned\\u2019 curve. This reiterates that CLIP\\u2019s classification perfor-\\nmance is directly related to the similarity of its training set to the test set. Additional visualizations for\\nother datasets (both ImageNet-based and otherwise) as well as a comparison with ImageNet-trained\\nmodels can be found in Apps. B and D. Note that since we prune large fractions of the training\\nset here, the pruned images are not yet very specific to the test set used to compute strain,i.

However, our results validate using similarity-based\\npruning as an effective intervention that allows us to study how training samples impact performance\\non a given test set. In the next sections, we will explore how to hone this method to arrive at a more\\nprecise conclusion about the role of highly similar images.\\nCore set\\nAs an aside, we notice that CLIP\\u2019s performance when trained on \\u2018far-pruned\\u2019 LAION-\\n200M-splits remains stable up until a dataset size of 100M (see Fig. 3). The performance even\\nslightly surpasses the baseline, further indicating that dissimilar samples do not contribute to CLIP\\u2019s\\nperformance and instead act more like noise in the training data. Motivated by this performance, we\\nextract a LAION-400M core set with only 100M images by \\u2018far-pruning\\u2019 based on not one but six\\ncommon ImageNet-based benchmarks simultaneously. CLIP trained on this core set outperforms\\nmodels trained on a de-duplicated dataset of the same size (Ilharco et al., 2021) and roughly matches\\nthe performance of a LAION-200M-trained model (see Appx. B.4). We release this core set to ease\\nfurther exploration of the relationship between training distribution and CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot performance.\\n4.3\\nCOMPARING NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TRAINING SETS\\nGiven the impact of nearest-neighbor similarity on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot performance, it is natural to ask\\nhow LAION-400M\\u2019s nearest-neighbor similarity compares to that of other datasets. Specifically, for\\nImageNet-based benchmarks like ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, we compare the distribution of\\nnearest-neighbor similarities stest,i to LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train. We have already seen in\\nFig. 1 that compared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M seemed stylistically and semantically much\\nmore similar to ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, while the effect was reversed for ImageNet-Val.\\nUsing the notion of perceptual nearest-neighbor similarity, we can now fully capture the difference in\\nsimilarity in a principled manner. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, where we can now clearly observe that\\ncompared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M is indeed overall more similar to ImageNet-Sketch and\\nImageNet-R. We show additional histograms for other test sets in Apps. B and D.\\nMoreover, in Appx. A.2, we detail how many training samples in LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train\\nare near duplicates (duplicates up to small shifts or crops) of the test sets. While we found 3.1 % of\\nImageNet-Sketch images to have duplicates in LAION-400M, there are only 0.04 % ImageNet-Sketch\\nduplicates in ImageNet-Train. On the other hand, ImageNet-Train contains duplicates of 2.67 %\\nImageNet-Val images as opposed to just 0.14 % ImageNet-Val images in LAION-400M.\\nLAION-400M-trained CLIP has been reported to outperform ImageNet-trained methods on ImageNet-\\nSketch and ImageNet-R, while underperforming on ImageNet-Val (see Tab. 1). In light of the above\\nobservation, this could well be explained not by LAION-400M\\u2019s general scale and diversity but\\nspecifically by its fraction of training samples whose nearest-neighbor similarity to the test set\\nsurpasses that of any sample in ImageNet-Train. We term those samples highly similar images.

We end up with a corrected large\\ndataset replicating the similarity gap of the small one (right).\\nfollowing section formalizes this concept and explains how we can refine the similarity-based pruning\\nfrom Sec. 4.2 to quantify their impact on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance.\\n4.4\\nSIMILARITY GAP AND HIGHLY SIMILAR IMAGES\\nSecs. 4.2 and 4.3 provide direct and indirect evidence that CLIP\\u2019s performance on common ImageNet-\\nbased benchmarks might mainly stem from images in its training set that are highly similar to the test\\nsets. We now formalize this notion and describe how to systematically test our hypothesis. To this\\nend, we note that even for ImageNet-Train, the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i differs across test\\nsamples. Our goal is to prune LAION-400M so that the pruned dataset replicates the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities stest,i of ImageNet-Train.\\nLet us consider that we now have two training datasets, denoted as DS (small, like ImageNet-Train)\\nand DL (large, like LAION-400M), and still use a test dataset T (like ImageNet-Sketch). For the\\nsake of simplicity, we assume that DS is a subset of DL. We choose a similarity measure s as in\\nSec. 4.2. We collect all nearest-neighbor similarities stest,i (recall Eq. 3) in the set\\nS(D, T ) =\\n\\b\\nstest,i(D, T ) | i \\u2208\\n\\u0002\\n1, |T |\\n\\u0003\\t\\n(4)\\nwhich we term similarity gap. We can think of this set as a full characterization of the training set\\u2019s\\nsimilarity to any point in the test set; compare Fig. 5.\\nBased on the assumption that the large dataset contains all samples from the small dataset, it follows\\nthat si(DS) \\u2264si(DL). In other words, the nearest-neighbor similarity to samples in the small\\ntraining set is always smaller than or equal to the similarity to samples in the large training set.\\nConsequently, on a per-sample basis, S(DL, T ) is strictly larger than S(DS, T ), i.e., the large dataset\\nis generally more similar to the test than the small dataset. We aim to identify a maximally large\\nsubset \\u02dc\\nDL \\u2286DL of the large training set, such that its similarity gap S( \\u02dc\\nDL, T ) is equal to the\\nsimilarity gap S(DS, T ) of the small dataset (on a per-sample basis, meaning si( \\u02dc\\nDS) = si(DS) for\\nall samples). To achieve this, we examine each test sample ti and remove any sample x \\u2208DL for\\nwhich the similarity s(ti, x) > si(DS). We illustrate this procedure in Fig. 5.\\nThis method allows us to surgically remove highly similar images with respect to a given test set and\\nreference training set. Compared to the unconstrained pruning in Sec. 4.2, this will remove far less\\nsamples from LAION-400M, and thus allows us to isolate the impact of highly similar images.\\n5\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Further, we show that nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities differ between LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train, which leads to the hypothesis that this\\ndifference explains CLIP\\u2019s high classification accuracy on ImageNet-based test sets (Sec. 4.3). Finally,\\nwe phrase this hypothesis in terms of highly similar images, which leaves us with an interventional\\nmethod to test this hypothesis (Sec. 4.4).\\n4.1\\nQUANTIFYING PERCEPTUAL SIMILARITY\\nAbbas et al.

We observe a clear correlation between nearest-neighbor similarity and accuracy\\nacross datasets. For ImageNet-Sketch, for example, sketches without similar counterparts in LAION-\\n400M (similarity 0.38) are classified with 35 % accuracy, while sketches duplicated in LAION-400M\\n(similarity close to 1) reach up to 69 % accuracy. We show additional correlation plots for ImageNet-\\nbased test sets in App. B and for other test sets in App. D.\\nWe can observe the impact of nearest-neighbor similarity on classification performance more directly\\nby pruning samples from LAION-200M based on their nearest-neighbor similarity strain,i to a given\\ntest set, retraining CLIP, and evaluating its zero-shot classification performance on that test set. We\\ncompare three different pruning strategies: \\u2018near-pruning\\u2019 prunes in decreasing order of similarity\\n(pruning samples with high nearest-neighbor similarity first), \\u2018far-pruning\\u2019 prunes in increasing order\\nof similarity, and \\u2018rand-pruning\\u2019 prunes randomly irrespective of similarity. All strategies produce\\nLAION-200M-splits with 50M, 100M, and 150M pruned samples.\\nCLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance when trained on these splits is illustrated in Fig. 3 for\\nImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-Val.

The performance even\\nslightly surpasses the baseline, further indicating that dissimilar samples do not contribute to CLIP\\u2019s\\nperformance and instead act more like noise in the training data.

Specifically, for\\nImageNet-based benchmarks like ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, we compare the distribution of\\nnearest-neighbor similarities stest,i to LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train. We have already seen in\\nFig. 1 that compared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M seemed stylistically and semantically much\\nmore similar to ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, while the effect was reversed for ImageNet-Val.\\nUsing the notion of perceptual nearest-neighbor similarity, we can now fully capture the difference in\\nsimilarity in a principled manner. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, where we can now clearly observe that\\ncompared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M is indeed overall more similar to ImageNet-Sketch and\\nImageNet-R. We show additional histograms for other test sets in Apps. B and D.\\nMoreover, in Appx. A.2, we detail how many training samples in LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train\\nare near duplicates (duplicates up to small shifts or crops) of the test sets. While we found 3.1 % of\\nImageNet-Sketch images to have duplicates in LAION-400M, there are only 0.04 % ImageNet-Sketch\\nduplicates in ImageNet-Train. On the other hand, ImageNet-Train contains duplicates of 2.67 %\\nImageNet-Val images as opposed to just 0.14 % ImageNet-Val images in LAION-400M.\\nLAION-400M-trained CLIP has been reported to outperform ImageNet-trained methods on ImageNet-\\nSketch and ImageNet-R, while underperforming on ImageNet-Val (see Tab. 1). In light of the above\\nobservation, this could well be explained not by LAION-400M\\u2019s general scale and diversity but\\nspecifically by its fraction of training samples whose nearest-neighbor similarity to the test set\\nsurpasses that of any sample in ImageNet-Train.

A larger, denser, more diverse dataset likely\\ncontains samples more similar to given test points than a smaller, sparser one. To control for this,\\nwe compute the nearest-neighbor similarity of each test point to the smaller dataset (left) and prune\\npoints from the larger dataset that lie within this hull (center). We end up with a corrected large\\ndataset replicating the similarity gap of the small one (right).\\nfollowing section formalizes this concept and explains how we can refine the similarity-based pruning\\nfrom Sec. 4.2 to quantify their impact on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance.\\n4.4\\nSIMILARITY GAP AND HIGHLY SIMILAR IMAGES\\nSecs. 4.2 and 4.3 provide direct and indirect evidence that CLIP\\u2019s performance on common ImageNet-\\nbased benchmarks might mainly stem from images in its training set that are highly similar to the test\\nsets. We now formalize this notion and describe how to systematically test our hypothesis. To this\\nend, we note that even for ImageNet-Train, the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i differs across test\\nsamples. Our goal is to prune LAION-400M so that the pruned dataset replicates the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities stest,i of ImageNet-Train.\\nLet us consider that we now have two training datasets, denoted as DS (small, like ImageNet-Train)\\nand DL (large, like LAION-400M), and still use a test dataset T (like ImageNet-Sketch). For the\\nsake of simplicity, we assume that DS is a subset of DL. We choose a similarity measure s as in\\nSec. 4.2. We collect all nearest-neighbor similarities stest,i (recall Eq. 3) in the set\\nS(D, T ) =\\n\\b\\nstest,i(D, T ) | i \\u2208\\n\\u0002\\n1, |T |\\n\\u0003\\t\\n(4)\\nwhich we term similarity gap. We can think of this set as a full characterization of the training set\\u2019s\\nsimilarity to any point in the test set; compare Fig. 5.\\nBased on the assumption that the large dataset contains all samples from the small dataset, it follows\\nthat si(DS) \\u2264si(DL). In other words, the nearest-neighbor similarity to samples in the small\\ntraining set is always smaller than or equal to the similarity to samples in the large training set.\\nConsequently, on a per-sample basis, S(DL, T ) is strictly larger than S(DS, T ), i.e., the large dataset\\nis generally more similar to the test than the small dataset. We aim to identify a maximally large\\nsubset \\u02dc\\nDL \\u2286DL of the large training set, such that its similarity gap S( \\u02dc\\nDL, T ) is equal to the\\nsimilarity gap S(DS, T ) of the small dataset (on a per-sample basis, meaning si( \\u02dc\\nDS) = si(DS) for\\nall samples). To achieve this, we examine each test sample ti and remove any sample x \\u2208DL for\\nwhich the similarity s(ti, x) > si(DS). We illustrate this procedure in Fig. 5.\\nThis method allows us to surgically remove highly similar images with respect to a given test set and\\nreference training set. Compared to the unconstrained pruning in Sec. 4.2, this will remove far less\\nsamples from LAION-400M, and thus allows us to isolate the impact of highly similar images.\\n5\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Finally,\\nwe phrase this hypothesis in terms of highly similar images, which leaves us with an interventional\\nmethod to test this hypothesis (Sec. 4.4).\\n4.1\\nQUANTIFYING PERCEPTUAL SIMILARITY\\nAbbas et al. (2023) demonstrated that nearest neighbors in the image embedding space of CLIP\\nshare semantic and stylistic characteristics. We illustrate this in Fig. 2, where we plot samples\\nfrom ImageNet-Sketch and their nearest neighbors in LAION-400M for different similarity values.\\nVisually, the similarity scores correlate well with the closeness of the image pairs. This is corroborated\\nby other works that demonstrate high perceptual alignment between CLIP\\u2019s embedding similarity and\\nhuman perception (Fu et al., 2023), or using it to sample ImageNet-like images from a large dataset\\n(Gadre et al., 2023), or building a similarity-based classifier (Zhang et al., 2021).\\nWe follow these works and quantify perceptual similarity as the cosine similarity in CLIP ViT-B\\/16+\\u2019s\\nimage embedding space. App. E ablates the choice of the model used to compute this metric. We\\ndenote the similarity of two samples xi, xj \\u2208Rn as\\ns(xi, xj) : Rn \\u00d7 Rn \\u2192[\\u22121, 1].\\n(1)\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nFigure 3: Nearest-neighbor similarity is predictive of performance. Left: LAION-400M-trained\\nCLIP\\u2019s top-1 classification accuracy on test samples is highly correlated to their nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarity stest,i. Results are averaged over 0.05 similarity intervals. Center and right: Similarity-\\nbased pruning greatly impacts CLIP\\u2019s top-1 classification accuracy. We train a baseline model on\\nLAION-200M (see Sec. 3) and additional models on LAION-200M-splits created by random pruning,\\nnear-pruning (in order of decreasing similarity), and far-pruning (in order of increasing similarity).\\nCompared to training on \\u2018rand-pruned\\u2019 splits (solid blue curve), training on \\u2018near-pruned\\u2019 splits (solid\\nred curve) drastically decreases classification accuracy. Training on \\u2018far-pruned\\u2019 splits (dashed blue\\ncurve) impacts accuracy comparatively little.\\nWe now consider the relation between a training dataset D and a test set T . Using the similarity\\nmetric s, we can find the nearest neighbor in the test set for each training sample. This allows us to\\nassign each training sample xi \\u2208D the nearest-neighbor similarity\\nstrain,i(D, T ) = max\\nt\\u2208T s(t, xi).\\n(2)\\nIn the same way, we can assign each test sample ti \\u2208T the nearest-neighbor similarity\\nstest,i(D, T ) = max\\nx\\u2208D s(ti, x).\\n(3)\\n4.2\\nNEAREST-NEIGHBOR SIMILARITY DRIVES PERFORMANCE\\nWe can now examine the relationship between nearest-neighbor similarity and CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot\\nclassification performance.\\nFig. 3 (left) illustrates that the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i of test samples in ImageNet-Sketch,\\nImageNet-R, and ImageNet-Val to LAION-200M is a good predictor of CLIP\\u2019s top-1 accuracy on\\nthese samples. We observe a clear correlation between nearest-neighbor similarity and accuracy\\nacross datasets. For ImageNet-Sketch, for example, sketches without similar counterparts in LAION-\\n400M (similarity 0.38) are classified with 35 % accuracy, while sketches duplicated in LAION-400M\\n(similarity close to 1) reach up to 69 % accuracy. We show additional correlation plots for ImageNet-\\nbased test sets in App. B and for other test sets in App. D.\\nWe can observe the impact of nearest-neighbor similarity on classification performance more directly\\nby pruning samples from LAION-200M based on their nearest-neighbor similarity strain,i to a given\\ntest set, retraining CLIP, and evaluating its zero-shot classification performance on that test set. We\\ncompare three different pruning strategies: \\u2018near-pruning\\u2019 prunes in decreasing order of similarity\\n(pruning samples with high nearest-neighbor similarity first), \\u2018far-pruning\\u2019 prunes in increasing order\\nof similarity, and \\u2018rand-pruning\\u2019 prunes randomly irrespective of similarity. All strategies produce\\nLAION-200M-splits with 50M, 100M, and 150M pruned samples.\\nCLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance when trained on these splits is illustrated in Fig. 3 for\\nImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-Val. The \\u2018near-pruned\\u2019 accuracy curve drops much quicker with\\ndecreasing dataset size than the \\u2018rand-pruned\\u2019 curve. This reiterates that CLIP\\u2019s classification perfor-\\nmance is directly related to the similarity of its training set to the test set. Additional visualizations for\\nother datasets (both ImageNet-based and otherwise) as well as a comparison with ImageNet-trained\\nmodels can be found in Apps. B and D. Note that since we prune large fractions of the training\\nset here, the pruned images are not yet very specific to the test set used to compute strain,i.

The performance even\\nslightly surpasses the baseline, further indicating that dissimilar samples do not contribute to CLIP\\u2019s\\nperformance and instead act more like noise in the training data. Motivated by this performance, we\\nextract a LAION-400M core set with only 100M images by \\u2018far-pruning\\u2019 based on not one but six\\ncommon ImageNet-based benchmarks simultaneously. CLIP trained on this core set outperforms\\nmodels trained on a de-duplicated dataset of the same size (Ilharco et al., 2021) and roughly matches\\nthe performance of a LAION-200M-trained model (see Appx. B.4). We release this core set to ease\\nfurther exploration of the relationship between training distribution and CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot performance.\\n4.3\\nCOMPARING NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TRAINING SETS\\nGiven the impact of nearest-neighbor similarity on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot performance, it is natural to ask\\nhow LAION-400M\\u2019s nearest-neighbor similarity compares to that of other datasets. Specifically, for\\nImageNet-based benchmarks like ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, we compare the distribution of\\nnearest-neighbor similarities stest,i to LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train. We have already seen in\\nFig. 1 that compared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M seemed stylistically and semantically much\\nmore similar to ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, while the effect was reversed for ImageNet-Val.\\nUsing the notion of perceptual nearest-neighbor similarity, we can now fully capture the difference in\\nsimilarity in a principled manner. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, where we can now clearly observe that\\ncompared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M is indeed overall more similar to ImageNet-Sketch and\\nImageNet-R. We show additional histograms for other test sets in Apps. B and D.\\nMoreover, in Appx. A.2, we detail how many training samples in LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train\\nare near duplicates (duplicates up to small shifts or crops) of the test sets. While we found 3.1 % of\\nImageNet-Sketch images to have duplicates in LAION-400M, there are only 0.04 % ImageNet-Sketch\\nduplicates in ImageNet-Train. On the other hand, ImageNet-Train contains duplicates of 2.67 %\\nImageNet-Val images as opposed to just 0.14 % ImageNet-Val images in LAION-400M.\\nLAION-400M-trained CLIP has been reported to outperform ImageNet-trained methods on ImageNet-\\nSketch and ImageNet-R, while underperforming on ImageNet-Val (see Tab. 1). In light of the above\\nobservation, this could well be explained not by LAION-400M\\u2019s general scale and diversity but\\nspecifically by its fraction of training samples whose nearest-neighbor similarity to the test set\\nsurpasses that of any sample in ImageNet-Train.

We now formalize this notion and describe how to systematically test our hypothesis. To this\\nend, we note that even for ImageNet-Train, the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i differs across test\\nsamples. Our goal is to prune LAION-400M so that the pruned dataset replicates the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities stest,i of ImageNet-Train.\\nLet us consider that we now have two training datasets, denoted as DS (small, like ImageNet-Train)\\nand DL (large, like LAION-400M), and still use a test dataset T (like ImageNet-Sketch). For the\\nsake of simplicity, we assume that DS is a subset of DL. We choose a similarity measure s as in\\nSec. 4.2. We collect all nearest-neighbor similarities stest,i (recall Eq. 3) in the set\\nS(D, T ) =\\n\\b\\nstest,i(D, T ) | i \\u2208\\n\\u0002\\n1, |T |\\n\\u0003\\t\\n(4)\\nwhich we term similarity gap. We can think of this set as a full characterization of the training set\\u2019s\\nsimilarity to any point in the test set; compare Fig. 5.\\nBased on the assumption that the large dataset contains all samples from the small dataset, it follows\\nthat si(DS) \\u2264si(DL). In other words, the nearest-neighbor similarity to samples in the small\\ntraining set is always smaller than or equal to the similarity to samples in the large training set.\\nConsequently, on a per-sample basis, S(DL, T ) is strictly larger than S(DS, T ), i.e., the large dataset\\nis generally more similar to the test than the small dataset. We aim to identify a maximally large\\nsubset \\u02dc\\nDL \\u2286DL of the large training set, such that its similarity gap S( \\u02dc\\nDL, T ) is equal to the\\nsimilarity gap S(DS, T ) of the small dataset (on a per-sample basis, meaning si( \\u02dc\\nDS) = si(DS) for\\nall samples). To achieve this, we examine each test sample ti and remove any sample x \\u2208DL for\\nwhich the similarity s(ti, x) > si(DS). We illustrate this procedure in Fig. 5.\\nThis method allows us to surgically remove highly similar images with respect to a given test set and\\nreference training set. Compared to the unconstrained pruning in Sec. 4.2, this will remove far less\\nsamples from LAION-400M, and thus allows us to isolate the impact of highly similar images.\\n5\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Based on this metric,\\nwe demonstrate that CLIP\\u2019s performance on a test set is strongly related to the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarity between LAION-400M and a test set (Sec. 4.2). Further, we show that nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities differ between LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train, which leads to the hypothesis that this\\ndifference explains CLIP\\u2019s high classification accuracy on ImageNet-based test sets (Sec. 4.3). Finally,\\nwe phrase this hypothesis in terms of highly similar images, which leaves us with an interventional\\nmethod to test this hypothesis (Sec. 4.4).\\n4.1\\nQUANTIFYING PERCEPTUAL SIMILARITY\\nAbbas et al. (2023) demonstrated that nearest neighbors in the image embedding space of CLIP\\nshare semantic and stylistic characteristics. We illustrate this in Fig. 2, where we plot samples\\nfrom ImageNet-Sketch and their nearest neighbors in LAION-400M for different similarity values.\\nVisually, the similarity scores correlate well with the closeness of the image pairs. This is corroborated\\nby other works that demonstrate high perceptual alignment between CLIP\\u2019s embedding similarity and\\nhuman perception (Fu et al., 2023), or using it to sample ImageNet-like images from a large dataset\\n(Gadre et al., 2023), or building a similarity-based classifier (Zhang et al., 2021).\\nWe follow these works and quantify perceptual similarity as the cosine similarity in CLIP ViT-B\\/16+\\u2019s\\nimage embedding space. App. E ablates the choice of the model used to compute this metric. We\\ndenote the similarity of two samples xi, xj \\u2208Rn as\\ns(xi, xj) : Rn \\u00d7 Rn \\u2192[\\u22121, 1].\\n(1)\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nFigure 3: Nearest-neighbor similarity is predictive of performance. Left: LAION-400M-trained\\nCLIP\\u2019s top-1 classification accuracy on test samples is highly correlated to their nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarity stest,i. Results are averaged over 0.05 similarity intervals. Center and right: Similarity-\\nbased pruning greatly impacts CLIP\\u2019s top-1 classification accuracy. We train a baseline model on\\nLAION-200M (see Sec. 3) and additional models on LAION-200M-splits created by random pruning,\\nnear-pruning (in order of decreasing similarity), and far-pruning (in order of increasing similarity).\\nCompared to training on \\u2018rand-pruned\\u2019 splits (solid blue curve), training on \\u2018near-pruned\\u2019 splits (solid\\nred curve) drastically decreases classification accuracy. Training on \\u2018far-pruned\\u2019 splits (dashed blue\\ncurve) impacts accuracy comparatively little.\\nWe now consider the relation between a training dataset D and a test set T . Using the similarity\\nmetric s, we can find the nearest neighbor in the test set for each training sample. This allows us to\\nassign each training sample xi \\u2208D the nearest-neighbor similarity\\nstrain,i(D, T ) = max\\nt\\u2208T s(t, xi).\\n(2)\\nIn the same way, we can assign each test sample ti \\u2208T the nearest-neighbor similarity\\nstest,i(D, T ) = max\\nx\\u2208D s(ti, x).\\n(3)\\n4.2\\nNEAREST-NEIGHBOR SIMILARITY DRIVES PERFORMANCE\\nWe can now examine the relationship between nearest-neighbor similarity and CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot\\nclassification performance.\\nFig. 3 (left) illustrates that the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i of test samples in ImageNet-Sketch,\\nImageNet-R, and ImageNet-Val to LAION-200M is a good predictor of CLIP\\u2019s top-1 accuracy on\\nthese samples. We observe a clear correlation between nearest-neighbor similarity and accuracy\\nacross datasets. For ImageNet-Sketch, for example, sketches without similar counterparts in LAION-\\n400M (similarity 0.38) are classified with 35 % accuracy, while sketches duplicated in LAION-400M\\n(similarity close to 1) reach up to 69 % accuracy. We show additional correlation plots for ImageNet-\\nbased test sets in App. B and for other test sets in App. D.\\nWe can observe the impact of nearest-neighbor similarity on classification performance more directly\\nby pruning samples from LAION-200M based on their nearest-neighbor similarity strain,i to a given\\ntest set, retraining CLIP, and evaluating its zero-shot classification performance on that test set. We\\ncompare three different pruning strategies: \\u2018near-pruning\\u2019 prunes in decreasing order of similarity\\n(pruning samples with high nearest-neighbor similarity first), \\u2018far-pruning\\u2019 prunes in increasing order\\nof similarity, and \\u2018rand-pruning\\u2019 prunes randomly irrespective of similarity. All strategies produce\\nLAION-200M-splits with 50M, 100M, and 150M pruned samples.\\nCLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance when trained on these splits is illustrated in Fig. 3 for\\nImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-Val. The \\u2018near-pruned\\u2019 accuracy curve drops much quicker with\\ndecreasing dataset size than the \\u2018rand-pruned\\u2019 curve. This reiterates that CLIP\\u2019s classification perfor-\\nmance is directly related to the similarity of its training set to the test set. Additional visualizations for\\nother datasets (both ImageNet-based and otherwise) as well as a comparison with ImageNet-trained\\nmodels can be found in Apps. B and D. Note that since we prune large fractions of the training\\nset here, the pruned images are not yet very specific to the test set used to compute strain,i.

ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R are overall more similar to LAION-400M, while\\nImageNet-Train is more similar to ImageNet-Val.\\nresult, pruning based on one ImageNet-based dataset generally decreases performance across many\\nImageNet-based datasets, although not on not on other tasks (see App. B).\\nThe observation so far is not surprising: Performance on the test set decreases in tandem with the\\ntraining distribution\\u2019s similarity to the test set. However, our results validate using similarity-based\\npruning as an effective intervention that allows us to study how training samples impact performance\\non a given test set. In the next sections, we will explore how to hone this method to arrive at a more\\nprecise conclusion about the role of highly similar images.\\nCore set\\nAs an aside, we notice that CLIP\\u2019s performance when trained on \\u2018far-pruned\\u2019 LAION-\\n200M-splits remains stable up until a dataset size of 100M (see Fig. 3). The performance even\\nslightly surpasses the baseline, further indicating that dissimilar samples do not contribute to CLIP\\u2019s\\nperformance and instead act more like noise in the training data. Motivated by this performance, we\\nextract a LAION-400M core set with only 100M images by \\u2018far-pruning\\u2019 based on not one but six\\ncommon ImageNet-based benchmarks simultaneously. CLIP trained on this core set outperforms\\nmodels trained on a de-duplicated dataset of the same size (Ilharco et al., 2021) and roughly matches\\nthe performance of a LAION-200M-trained model (see Appx. B.4). We release this core set to ease\\nfurther exploration of the relationship between training distribution and CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot performance.\\n4.3\\nCOMPARING NEAREST-NEIGHBOR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TRAINING SETS\\nGiven the impact of nearest-neighbor similarity on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot performance, it is natural to ask\\nhow LAION-400M\\u2019s nearest-neighbor similarity compares to that of other datasets. Specifically, for\\nImageNet-based benchmarks like ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, we compare the distribution of\\nnearest-neighbor similarities stest,i to LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train. We have already seen in\\nFig. 1 that compared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M seemed stylistically and semantically much\\nmore similar to ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R, while the effect was reversed for ImageNet-Val.\\nUsing the notion of perceptual nearest-neighbor similarity, we can now fully capture the difference in\\nsimilarity in a principled manner. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, where we can now clearly observe that\\ncompared to ImageNet-Train, LAION-400M is indeed overall more similar to ImageNet-Sketch and\\nImageNet-R. We show additional histograms for other test sets in Apps. B and D.\\nMoreover, in Appx. A.2, we detail how many training samples in LAION-400M and ImageNet-Train\\nare near duplicates (duplicates up to small shifts or crops) of the test sets. While we found 3.1 % of\\nImageNet-Sketch images to have duplicates in LAION-400M, there are only 0.04 % ImageNet-Sketch\\nduplicates in ImageNet-Train. On the other hand, ImageNet-Train contains duplicates of 2.67 %\\nImageNet-Val images as opposed to just 0.14 % ImageNet-Val images in LAION-400M.\\nLAION-400M-trained CLIP has been reported to outperform ImageNet-trained methods on ImageNet-\\nSketch and ImageNet-R, while underperforming on ImageNet-Val (see Tab. 1). In light of the above\\nobservation, this could well be explained not by LAION-400M\\u2019s general scale and diversity but\\nspecifically by its fraction of training samples whose nearest-neighbor similarity to the test set\\nsurpasses that of any sample in ImageNet-Train. We term those samples highly similar images.

A larger, denser, more diverse dataset likely\\ncontains samples more similar to given test points than a smaller, sparser one. To control for this,\\nwe compute the nearest-neighbor similarity of each test point to the smaller dataset (left) and prune\\npoints from the larger dataset that lie within this hull (center). We end up with a corrected large\\ndataset replicating the similarity gap of the small one (right).\\nfollowing section formalizes this concept and explains how we can refine the similarity-based pruning\\nfrom Sec. 4.2 to quantify their impact on CLIP\\u2019s zero-shot classification performance.\\n4.4\\nSIMILARITY GAP AND HIGHLY SIMILAR IMAGES\\nSecs. 4.2 and 4.3 provide direct and indirect evidence that CLIP\\u2019s performance on common ImageNet-\\nbased benchmarks might mainly stem from images in its training set that are highly similar to the test\\nsets. We now formalize this notion and describe how to systematically test our hypothesis. To this\\nend, we note that even for ImageNet-Train, the nearest-neighbor similarity stest,i differs across test\\nsamples. Our goal is to prune LAION-400M so that the pruned dataset replicates the nearest-neighbor\\nsimilarities stest,i of ImageNet-Train.\\nLet us consider that we now have two training datasets, denoted as DS (small, like ImageNet-Train)\\nand DL (large, like LAION-400M), and still use a test dataset T (like ImageNet-Sketch). For the\\nsake of simplicity, we assume that DS is a subset of DL. We choose a similarity measure s as in\\nSec. 4.2. We collect all nearest-neighbor similarities stest,i (recall Eq. 3) in the set\\nS(D, T ) =\\n\\b\\nstest,i(D, T ) | i \\u2208\\n\\u0002\\n1, |T |\\n\\u0003\\t\\n(4)\\nwhich we term similarity gap. We can think of this set as a full characterization of the training set\\u2019s\\nsimilarity to any point in the test set; compare Fig. 5.\\nBased on the assumption that the large dataset contains all samples from the small dataset, it follows\\nthat si(DS) \\u2264si(DL). In other words, the nearest-neighbor similarity to samples in the small\\ntraining set is always smaller than or equal to the similarity to samples in the large training set.\\nConsequently, on a per-sample basis, S(DL, T ) is strictly larger than S(DS, T ), i.e., the large dataset\\nis generally more similar to the test than the small dataset. We aim to identify a maximally large\\nsubset \\u02dc\\nDL \\u2286DL of the large training set, such that its similarity gap S( \\u02dc\\nDL, T ) is equal to the\\nsimilarity gap S(DS, T ) of the small dataset (on a per-sample basis, meaning si( \\u02dc\\nDS) = si(DS) for\\nall samples). To achieve this, we examine each test sample ti and remove any sample x \\u2208DL for\\nwhich the similarity s(ti, x) > si(DS). We illustrate this procedure in Fig. 5.\\nThis method allows us to surgically remove highly similar images with respect to a given test set and\\nreference training set. Compared to the unconstrained pruning in Sec. 4.2, this will remove far less\\nsamples from LAION-400M, and thus allows us to isolate the impact of highly similar images.\\n5\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
