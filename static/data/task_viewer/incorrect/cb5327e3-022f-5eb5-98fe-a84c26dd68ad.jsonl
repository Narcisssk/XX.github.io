{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Code generation automatically generates programs for the natural language (NL) requirement. Recent years have seen a trend in tackling code generation tasks with large language models (LLMs), such as Code Llama (Rozi\\u00e8re et al., 2023), StarCoder (Li et al., 2023), and DeepSeekCoder (DeepSeek, 2023). Many efforts have been performed (Zhang et al., 2023b; Luo et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023) and shown impressive code generation abilities.\\n\\nDespite achieving satisfactory performances, these studies mainly focus on simple generation scenarios including statement-level and functionlevel code generation. Statement-level code generation (Iyer et al., 2018; Athiwaratkun et al., 2022) aims to output statement-specifc source codes. Function-level code generation (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021) predicts independent code that only invokes built-in functions and APIs from third-party libraries. For both scenarios, the length of the generated code is rather short, and they only generate standalone code units. However, more than $70\\\\%$ functions in the open-source projects are non-standalone (Yu et al., 2023). Developers typically write programs based on specifc code environments, generally referring to code repositories. These repo-level code snippets usually have intricate contextual dependencies, which is too complex for existing LLMs to handle and generate (Li et al., 2024).\\nTo enhance the effcacy of LLMs in repo-level code generation tasks, we draw inspiration from human programming practices. Developers typically employ a variety of tools to aid in complex programming. For instance, they might utilize search engines to explore key concepts or static analysis tools to identify pre-existing functions or classes. These tools are instrumental in the development of code projects. Embracing this idea, we propose a novel LLM-based agent framework CODEAGENT that leverages external tools to help LLMs in repo-level code generation. With fve programming tools, CODEAGENT is capable of interacting with the software artifacts, including retrieving useful information, fnding existing code symbols in the repository, and handling essential code testing. To guide LLMs to effciently use tools, we draw on four agent strategies covering ReAct, Tool-Planning, OpenAIFunc, and Rule-based form. Based on agent strategies, LLMs can automatically select suitable tools for each repo-level task, fnally providing a comprehensive response.\\n\\nIn order to measure the effectiveness of our method at the code repository, we manually construct CODEAGENTBENCH, a benchmark specifcally for repo-level code generation with a total of 101 functions and classes sourced from real code projects. It provides rich information about the repository, such as documentation and contextual dependency, to help LLMs better understand it. We further conduct extensive experiments for evaluation. We apply CODEAGENT to nine powerful open-source and closed-source LLMs with parameter sizes ranging from 13B to 175B to show the universality. Compared to directly generating from LLMs, experimental results on CODEAGENTBENCH reveal that CODEAGENT achieves signifcant improvements ranging from 2.0 to an extraordinary 15.8 across various LLMs. Further evaluations on well-known function-level benchmark HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) confrm CODEAGENT\\u2019s versatility in diverse code generation tasks. Remarkably, when compared to commercial products like GitHub Copilot (Dakhel et al., 2023), CODEAGENT stands out, demonstrating superior accuracy. These fndings highlight the robust practical capabilities of CODEAGENT in the code generation community, underscoring its potential to evolve real-world repo-level coding challenges. We summarize our main contributions:\\n\\u2022 We make an attempt to investigate repo-level code generation, which has crucial worth for understanding LLMs\\u2019 performance in practical code generation scenarios. \\u2022 We propose CODEAGENT, an LLM-based agent framework for repo-level code generation.
