{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

For evaluation, we use UCF101 [49] and our ImageBench\\ndataset, which includes diverse categories (e.g., nature, humans, animals, plants, food, vehicles) and\\ncomplex elements like numerals, colors, and intricate scenes, similar to DrawBench [44]. In total, 100\\nimages are collected from various websites and T2I models such as SDXL [39] and UniDiffuser [5].\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\nOn UCF101, we report Fr\\u00e9chet Video Distance (FVD), Inception Score (IS),\\nand Motion Score (MS). For ImageBench, we conduct user studies with 10 subjects to perform\\npairwise comparisons of our methods against baselines, evaluating motion, temporal consistency,\\nimage alignment, and overall performance. For motion-conditioned methods, we also report the\\nmotion score error between the generated video and the input motion score at various levels. Motion\\nscores are computed using flow maps following SVD [9], except for the PIA [70], where we follow\\nits original algorithm and compute the L1 distance. More details on the metric computations are\\nprovided in Appendix B.\\nImplementation Details.\\nFor Analytic-Init, we use 5000 samples from the Webvid-2M dataset to\\nestimate pM(XM) by default. We set M = 0.96T, 0.96T and \\u03c3M = 100 for VideoCrafter1 [12],\\nDynamiCrafter [63], and SVD [9] on UCF101. For ImageBench, we adjust M to 0.92T, 0.92T and\\n\\u03c3M = 100. For the TimeNoise, we set \\u03b2m = 25, 100, and 100 for VideoCrafter1, DynamiCrafter,\\nand SVD, respectively. The function \\u00b5(t) = 2t5 \\u22121 is applied across all baselines. These baselines\\nare fine-tuned for 20,000 iterations, using either the official code or replication of the official settings\\nexcept for batch size.

We validate our inference strategy\\nagainst the original method and a naively finetuned version, and our training strategy against a naively\\nfinetuned version. The quantitative comparisons and qualitative results are presented in Tab. 1,\\nFig. 3, Fig. 5 and Fig. 7, leading to several key observations. First, our strategies significantly\\nimprove motion scores and reduce motion score error, demonstrating their effectiveness in precisely\\ncontrolling motion degrees and mitigating conditional image leakage. Second, we achieve both\\ndynamic motion and high video quality, as reflected by improved FVD and IS scores. The user\\nstudy in Fig. 8 further supports that our strategies enhance video dynamism while preserving image\\nalignment and temporal consistency, yielding superior overall performance.\\nEvaluating the combined inference and training strategies.\\nIn this section, we aim to investigate\\nthe necessity of combining two strategies. As illustrated in Tab. 7, for DynamiCrafter [63] and\\nSVD [9], our TimeNoise effectively mitigates conditional image leakage, rendering the additional\\ninference strategy less impactful. Conversely, for VideoCrafter1 [12], which relies solely on CLIP\\nimage embedding for information, employing excessive TimeNoise disrupts image alignment. Hence,\\nwe utilize a moderate TimeNoise (\\u03b2m = 25), where the inference strategy remains effective.\\nComparison with SOTA noise initialization and conditioning augmentation methods.\\nWe\\ncompare our Analytic-Init with SOTA noise initialization methods [41, 61, 19] and our TimeNoise\\nwith SOTA conditioning augmentation [25]. As shown in Tab. 2, Analytic-Init outperforms all\\nbaselines. It achieves higher motion scores than FrameInit [41], which limits motion by duplicating\\nthe conditional image as static guidance. Compared to FreeInit [61], our method reduces inference\\ntime by more than half while slightly improving performance, as FreeInit\\u2019s iterative process increases\\ntime. Compared to Progressive Noise [19], Analytic-Init performs better by generating videos from\\nan earlier time step, a gap the baseline cannot handle effectively. As shown in Fig. 9 in the Appendix,\\nCDM [25] results in lower motion, whereas our method produces more dynamic videos. Additionally,\\na naive baseline using a single value for \\u03b2s = \\u03b2m\\n\\u00b5(t)+1\\n2\\nleads to poor image alignment, further\\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our time-dependent noise distribution.\\n9\\n58.70%\\n55.50%\\n50.80%\\n58.00%\\n44.70%\\n50.90%\\n48.50%\\n49.80%\\n58.80%\\n58.00%\\n56.00%\\n59.50%\\n41.30%\\n44.50%\\n49.20%\\n42.00%\\n55.30%\\n49.10%\\n51.50%\\n50.20%\\n41.20%\\n42.00%\\n44.00%\\n40.50%\\n0.00%\\n25.00%\\n50.00%\\n75.00%\\n100.00%\\nDC.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\n11.90%\\n4.50%\\n12.20%\\n10.00%\\n12.70%\\n15.50%\\n2.30%\\n33.70%\\n5.40%\\n4.00%\\n7.50%\\n4.00%\\n88.10%\\n95.50%\\n87.80%\\n90.00%\\n87.30%\\n84.50%\\n97.70%\\n66.30%\\n94.60%\\n96.00%\\n92.50%\\n96.00%\\n0.00%\\n25.00%\\n50.00%\\n75.00%\\n100.00%\\nDC.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\n54.30%\\n50.40%\\n49.20%\\n57.50%\\n50.10%\\n50.30%\\n50.60%\\n55.10%\\n55.00%\\n51.50%\\n59.00%\\n53.00%\\n45.70%\\n49.60%\\n50.80%\\n42.50%\\n49.90%\\n49.70%\\n49.40%\\n44.90%\\n45.00%\\n48.50%\\n41.00%\\n47.00%\\n0.00%\\n25.00%\\n50.00%\\n75.00%\\n100.00%\\nDC.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\n15.80%\\n15.90%\\n19.10%\\n24.10%\\n16.50%\\n23.10%\\n3.80%\\n34.90%\\n7.2%\\n3.0%\\n15.5%\\n7.0%\\n84.20%\\n84.10%\\n80.90%\\n75.90%\\n83.50%\\n76.90%\\n96.20%\\n65.10%\\n92.8%\\n97.0%\\n84.5%\\n93.0%\\n0.00%\\n25.00%\\n50.00%\\n75.00%\\n100.00%\\nDC.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\nDC-NT.\\nVC-NT.\\nSVD-NT.\\nBaseline\\nAnalytic-Init\\nTimeNoise\\nCIL (full version)\\nOverall\\nDynamic motion\\nImage alignment\\nTemporal consistency\\nAnalytic-Init\\nTimeNoise\\nCIL\\nAnalytic-Init\\nTimeNoise\\nCIL\\nAnalytic-Init\\nTimeNoise\\nCIL\\nAnalytic-Init\\nTimeNoise\\nCIL\\nFigure 8: User preference percentages for ours against baselines. <Method>-NT. is the naively\\nfine-tuned baseline.
