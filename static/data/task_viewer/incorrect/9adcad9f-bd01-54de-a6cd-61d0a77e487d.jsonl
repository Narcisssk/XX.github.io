{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

KGs excel in explicitly representing manifold relationships, so with an expanding wealth of information they become crucial tools in the digital age.\\nMany KGs consist of knowledge triplets, where nodes are entities and edges represent relationships holding between them. Each triplet represents a fact in pseudo-natural language, e.g., (Thailand; Capital; Bangkok) in DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007). Despite the (usual) simplicity of each individual triplet, complex structures emerge in KGs. We refer to such KGs as Graphs of Triplets (GoTs).\\n\\nTo use GoTs effectively, we need meaningful encodings of their components. A natural choice is leveraging LMs, as they can capture the semantics of textually encoded entities, relations or entire triplets. But LMs are not prepared to capture graphstructured information and cannot model complex interactions in a GoT. To alleviate this problem, one can leverage graph NNs (GNNs). But GNNs are not well suited to capture meanings associated with text, and hence often LMs are used to convert nodes (and possibly edges) to language-based semantic embeddings. But in such settings, semantic encoding leveraged from LMs and structural reasoning performed by GNNs are separated and are driven by distinct underlying principles. We expect this to limit model performance if both textual and structural information are important for a task.\\nIn this work we introduce a Graph Language Model (GLM) that resolves this tension through early fusion of textual and structural information. Most LMs today are transformers. Since transformers operate on sets, Positional Encoding (PE) is used to inform them about the inherent sequential ordering of linguistic inputs. In our GLM formulation, we modify PE and self-attention to convert LMs (i.e., sequence transformers) to graph transformers that natively operate on graphs, while preserving their LM capabilities. Usually, a new architecture requires pretraining from scratch, which is extremely costly. By adopting some non-invasive changes in the LM\\u2019s self-attention module, we transform the LM to a Graph Transformer (GT) \\u2013 while maintaining compatibility with its pretrained LM parameters. When encoding a graph, LM-like attention patterns process linearly organized textual information of individual triplets, while GT-like attention patterns aggregate information along the graph structure. Hence, the GLM inherits text understanding of triplets from the LM, while its GT architecture allows it to directly perform structural reasoning, without additional GNN layers.\\n\\nImportantly, for text sequences \\u2013 which can be seen as a special type of graph \\u2013 the GLM is identical to the original LM. This allows the GLM to process interleaved inputs of text and GoT jointly, handling both modalities in a single framework.\\nOur main contributions are: (i) We propose Graph Language Models (GLMs) and a theoretical framework to construct them. GLMs are graph transformers, which enables graph reasoning. Simultaneously, they inherit and exploit LM weights, enabling them to represent and contextualize triplets in a GoT. Further, by encoding texts and graph components alike, it can naturally take graph and text data as interleaved inputs. (ii) Experiments on relation classifcation in ConceptNet subgraphs show that GLMs outperform LM- and GNN-based methods for encoding GoTs \\u2013 even when the inherited LM parameters are not updated during GLM training. (iii) KG population experiments on Wikidata subgraphs and corresponding Wikipedia abstracts show that GLMs can reason over interleaved inputs of GoTs and text \\u2013 again, outperforming strong LM-based methods.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"LMs One way to augment LMs with knowledge from KGs (Pan et al., 2024) is to formulate pretraining objectives that operate on a KG. E.g., LMs can be trained to generate parts of a KG, encouraging the LM to store KG content in its parameters. Typically, single triplets are used for pretraining (Bosselut et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2021; West et al., 2023). In such cases, the graph structure is not a target of pretraining. Some works generate larger substructures, such as paths or linearized subgraphs (Wang et al., 2020a; Schmitt et al., 2020; Huguet Cabot and Navigli, 2021). In either case, the LM needs to memorize the KG, as it will not be part of the input during inference.\\nAnother approach is to provide the linearized KG as part of the input during inference. This is common for KG-to-text generation (Schmitt et al., 2020; Ribeiro et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021), where models learn to take the linearized (typically small-sized) graphs as input. A recent trend is retrieval augmented generation, where relevant parts of a knowledge base, or KG, are retrieved, linearized and provided as part of a prompt (Gao et al., 2024).2\\nIn both options the graph must be linearized to ft the input or output of a sequence-to-sequence LM. Hence, no graph priors can be enforced \\u2013 instead, the LM has to learn the graph structure implicitly. By contrast, GLMs model a graph as a true graph and have inductive graph priors instilled in their architecture. This prepares a GLM for more profcient graph reasoning, compared to a LM approach.\\nGNNs LMs excel at representing single triplets, but struggle with structural reasoning. To alleviate this problem, LMs can be combined with GNNs. Many approaches get node and edge features from LMs and aggregate this information in the graph with GNNs (Lin et al., 2019; Malaviya et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023). Zhang et al. (2022); Yasunaga et al. (2022) train models consisting of a LM and a GNN that encode interleaved text and graph inputs jointly. They also use a LM to obtain node features.\\nWhile some approaches jointly train for textual understanding and graph reasoning, none offer a unifed method. By contrast, our GLM formulation seamlessly integrates both in a holistic framework for embedding language and KGs.\\nGraph Transformers GTs, a special type of GNN (Bronstein et al., 2021), gain popularity in NLP and beyond (Min et al., 2022; M\\u00fcller et al., 2023). E.g., Koncel-Kedziorski et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2020b) train GTs to generate text from KGs and AMRs, respectively. Most relevant to our work is Schmitt et al. (2021), who use GTs for KGto-text generation. Similar to us, they employ PE matrices, but train their model from scratch, which limits its applicability: while their model trained on WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) has a vocabulary size of 2,100, initializing a GLM from T5, equips it with T5\\u2019s full vocabulary of 32,128 tokens.\\nConcurrently, and independently from our work, Li et al. (2024) also convert a LM to a graph transformer. They focus on data-to-text generation, where they unify table, key-value and KG structures in a unifed graph format, and apply structureenhanced pre-training to support data-to-text generation with their structure-enhanced transformer model. They apply attention maps similar to ours to better capture the graph-structured input, which the pre-trained model rewrites into natural language. Contrary to their work, we do not resort to structureenhanced pre-training \\u2013 which is restricted in resources \\u2013 but instead assess the GLMs\\u2019 innate capabilities. We showcase the versatility of the inherited LM parameters in conjunction with our graph transformer architecture, by applying them to challenging reasoning tasks, where the model needs to reason over complementary inputs from text and graphs, and where it needs to infer information not present in the input, unlike data-to-text generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that our architectural changes are highly compatible with the original LM weights, via linear probing experiments, where the GLM outperforms conventional LM and Graph Transformer models.\\n\\n3 Preliminary: Graph Transformers (GT) This section briefy introduces graph transformers, focusing on architectural choices relevant for our work. We also discuss some general properties of GNNs that motivate our design choices in $\\\\S4$ .\\nThe attention in self-attention can be written as\\nwhere $Q,K$ and $V$ are the query, key and value matrices, and $d$ is the query and key dimension. The $B_{P}$ and $M$ matrices can be used for positional encoding and masking. Setting $B_{P}=M=0$ yields the standard formulation (Vaswani et al., 2017).\\nPositional Encoding The self-attention mechanism of transformer models is permutation invariant, i.e., it doesn\\u2019t have any notion of the order of its input elements. Thus, positional Encoding (PE) is used to inform LMs of the ordering of tokens in a text (Dufter et al., 2022). Most approaches employ either absolute $P E$ , where absolute token positions are encoded (Vaswani et al., 2017; Gehring et al., 2017) or relative $P E$ , which encodes the relative position between pairs of tokens (Shaw et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021; Press et al., 2022). Absolute PE is typically combined with the input sequence and hence, the PE does not need to be encoded in self-attention $\\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta}B_{P}=0\\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta}$ ). For relative\\nPE, $B_{P}$ encodes a bias depending on the relative distances between pairs of tokens \\u2013 for example, by learning one scalar for each possible distance:\\nwhere $P$ is a matrix of relative distances and $f(\\\\cdot)$ an elementwise function.\\nSimilarly, GTs use PEs to encode the structure of the input, and hence, their PE has to encode a graph structure, as opposed to a sequence. This can again be done with absolute or relative PEs. However, defning an \\u201cabsolute position\\u201d of a node or edge in a graph is not straightforward. While many methods exist, they are not directly compatible with the usual (absolute) \\u201ccounting position\\u201d known from sequence encoding in LMs. In this work we thus focus on relative PE. Given a directed acyclic path in a graph, we can defne the (signed) distance between any pair of nodes along a path simply as the number of hops between the nodes. The sign can be set by the direction of the path. Thus, by fnding a consistent set of such paths in $\\\\S4$ , we obtain relative distances and hence the graph\\u2019s PE.\\nMasked Attention In a vanilla transformer, selfattention is computed for all possible pairs of tokens in the input. By contrast, nodes typically only attend to adjacent nodes in GNNs. Therefore, information between more distant nodes has to be propagated across multiple GNN layers. For graphs, such sparse message passing approaches are sometimes preferred, as in most graphs the neighborhood size increases exponentially with increasing radius, which can cause loss of information due to over-smoothing (Chen et al., 2020). Thus, in GTs it can be benefcial to introduce graph priors, for example by restricting self-attention to local neighborhoods. This can be realized by setting elements of $M$ to 0 for pairs of tokens that should be connected, and to $-\\\\infty$ otherwise.\\nOn the other hand, it has been shown that a global view of the graph can enable effcient, longranged information fow (Alon and Yahav, 2021; Ribeiro et al., 2020). We will therefore present two model variants in $\\\\S4-\\\\mathbf{a}$ local and a global GLM.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Graph Language Model\",\"section_content\":\"GLM vs. GT We aim to design an architecture that can effciently and jointly reason over text and graph-structured data. GTs can offer desired graph priors, but they lack language understanding.\\nOne intuitive approach to bridge this gap is to pretrain a GT from scratch (Schmitt et al., 2021). But pretraining is costly and the necessary data bound to be scarce. We thus take a different avenue. We hypothesize that for reasoning over GoTs a model needs language understanding capabilities similar to those used for reasoning over text. Intuitively this should be the case, since (i) GoTs are designed to be understandable by humans and (ii) literate people can \\u201cread\\u201d and understand GoTs.\\nBy initializing a GT with parameters from a compatible LM, we obtain our Graph Language Model (GLM). The GT architecture introduces graph priors, while parameter initialization from the LM gives it language understanding capabilities. In the following we explain the necessary modifcations to the input graph and to the model, to make this work. The general idea is that (verbalized) triplets should resemble natural language as much as possible to enable LM weights to capture them, while graph reasoning should work via message passing.\\nGraph preprocessing A LM tokenizer converts text into a sequence of tokens from the LM vocabulary. Similarly, we process GoTs, such that the GLM can process the graphs \\u201cas a LM would do\\u201d (cf. Fig. 2). To achieve this, we frst convert the GoT to its so-called Levi graph (Schmitt et al., 2021), i.e., we replace each edge with a node that contains the relation name as text feature, and connect the new node to the head and tail of the original edge via unlabeled edges, preserving the direction of the original edge. Next, we tokenize each node and split each node into multiple nodes, such that every new node corresponds to a single token. New edges connect adjacent nodes, again preserving the original direction. This yields the extended Levi graph (see Fig. 2b). In this representation, each triplet is represented as a sequence of tokens \\u2013 just as it would be for a standard LM.3\\n\\nPositional Encodings As discussed in $\\\\S3$ , we prefer PEs that encode the relative position between pairs of tokens, determined by their signed distance. We can directly adopt this method to encode the relative position between pairs of tokens occurring within the same triplet \\u2013 by simply considering the triplet as a piece of text, and counting the token distance in this text. Note that a single token can occur in multiple triplets, leading to, e.g., multiple \\u201clefthand side neighbors\\u201d (cf. animal in Fig. 2b and 3). While this does not occur in ordinary sequential text, it does not impose a problem for relative PE.\\n\\nYet, the approach above breaks when tokens do not belong to the same triplet. To determine the distance between such pairs of tokens, previous work considered, e.g., the length of the shortest path between them (Schmitt et al., 2021). However, this results in PEs that do not come natural to a LM, since a triplet would appear in reversed order, if it is traversed in \\u201cthe wrong direction\\u201d in the shortest path.4 We therefore omit structure-informed PE between tokens that do not belong to the same triplet and instead propose two GLM variants: a local (\\u2113GLM) and a global $\\\\left(g\\\\mathbf{G}\\\\mathbf{L}\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\right)$ one.\\nLocal and global GLM Fig. 3 shows the relative token position matrix $P$ for the graph in Fig. 2b. In the \\u2113GLM the self-attention mechanism is restricted to tokens from the same triplet. This means that attention to any token located beyond the local triplet is set to 0 \\u2013 and hence does not require PE. Still, in such confgurations, messages can propagate through the graph across multiple layers, since tokens belonging to a concept can be shared by multiple triplets. This is analogous to standard message passing in GNNs, where non-adjacent nodes have no direct connection, but can still share information via message passing. For example, the representation of dog is contextualized by the triplets black poodle is a dog and dog is a animal after the frst \\u2113GLM layer. Hence in the second layer, when animal attends to dog, the animal embedding gets impacted by black poodle, even though there is no direct connection from animal to black poodle.\\nHowever, it has been shown that a global view can have benefts (Ribeiro et al., 2020). Hence, we also formalize the $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ , as an alternative where self-attention can connect any node to every other node. For this setting we need to assign a PE to any pair of tokens, including those that do not occur within the same triplet. For these pairs we introduce a new graph-to-graph (G2G) relative position. LMs don\\u2019t have learned parameters for G2G connections, so we initialize the parameters with the corresponding parameters of a relative position of $+\\\\infty$ . In a LM a relative position of $+\\\\infty$ means that the respective tokens occur somewhere \\u201cfar\\u201d away in a remote text passage. LMs learn a\\nproximity bias during pretraining, i.e., they tend to have higher attention scores between tokens that are close to each other in the text. This means that tokens with a high relative distance tend to have low attention scores. For our $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ this corresponds to a graph bias where distant nodes are less important, but are still accessible.5 Note that unlike in the \\u2113GLM, this bias is not part of the architecture. It originates from the pretrained parameters, meaning that the $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ can learn to attend to distant tokens. Along with $P$ and $M$ , the GLM takes a sequence of all tokens in the extended Levi graph as input. For this, we technically need to \\u201clinearize\\u201d the graph. However, the order of tokens in the resulting sequence does not matter: relative positions in $P$ are determined by distances in the graph, not in the sequence. Permuting the input sequence simply means that rows and columns of $P$ and $M$ need to be permuted accordingly, but the resulting token embeddings remain unchanged. See example matrices for $P$ and $M$ for \\u2113GLM and $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ in $\\\\S\\\\mathrm{A}$ Being transformers, GLMs have the same computational complexity as their respective LM. For sparse graphs the \\u2113GLM could make use of sparse matrix multiplication, making it more effcient than a corresponding LM or $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ . However, for our experiments this was not necessary.\\nJoint graph and text encoding If we use normal matrices for $P$ and $M$ , the GLM is identical to its underlying LM. Hence, GLMs can be applied to texts and \\u2013 more interestingly \\u2013 interleaved inputs of text and graph. In this joint setting, $P$ and $M$ each consists of four sub-matrices that correspond to self-attention between tokens from (i) graph-tograph, (ii) text-to-text, (iii) text-to-graph and (iv) graph-to-text. Graph-to-graph sub-matrices are formatted as described above for \\u2113GLM and $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ , respectively. Text-to-text sub-matrices are standard matrices from conventional sequence transformers. We introduce new T2G and G2T relative positions for text-to-graph, and graph-to-text connections, respectively. With this, the model can learn interaction strength between the two modalities. Similar to G2G in $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ , we initialize T2G and G2T parameters from $+\\\\infty$ . See example matrices in $\\\\S\\\\mathrm{A}$ .\\nUni- and Bidirectional LMs If a LM\\u2019s self-attention is unidirectional, information can only propagate along the direction of arrows in Fig. 2b for the \\u2113GLM. This means that, e.g., the representation of the node black poodle is independent of the rest of the graph. We could augment the graph with inverse relations to enable bidirectional information fow with unidirectional LMs, but in this work, we restrict our analysis to bidirectional models.\\n\\nT5 We use T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) \\u2013 a bidirectional encoder with unidirectional decoder \\u2013 as base LM to instantiate GLMs. In T5, relative distances in $P$ group into so-called buckets, and each bucket maps to one learned positional bias in $\\\\boldsymbol{B}_{P}$ for each head. Positional biases are shared across layers. The decoder is not needed to encode graphs, but can be used to generate sequences, such as text or linearized graphs in future work.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Experiments\",\"section_content\":\"We assess the GLMs\\u2019 capabilities for embedding GoTs in two experiments on relation (label) classifcation, i.e., classifying which relation belongs to a given head and tail entity.

Each triplet represents a fact in pseudo-natural language, e.g., (Thailand; Capital; Bangkok) in DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007). Despite the (usual) simplicity of each individual triplet, complex structures emerge in KGs. We refer to such KGs as Graphs of Triplets (GoTs).\\n\\nTo use GoTs effectively, we need meaningful encodings of their components. A natural choice is leveraging LMs, as they can capture the semantics of textually encoded entities, relations or entire triplets. But LMs are not prepared to capture graphstructured information and cannot model complex interactions in a GoT. To alleviate this problem, one can leverage graph NNs (GNNs). But GNNs are not well suited to capture meanings associated with text, and hence often LMs are used to convert nodes (and possibly edges) to language-based semantic embeddings. But in such settings, semantic encoding leveraged from LMs and structural reasoning performed by GNNs are separated and are driven by distinct underlying principles. We expect this to limit model performance if both textual and structural information are important for a task.\\nIn this work we introduce a Graph Language Model (GLM) that resolves this tension through early fusion of textual and structural information. Most LMs today are transformers. Since transformers operate on sets, Positional Encoding (PE) is used to inform them about the inherent sequential ordering of linguistic inputs. In our GLM formulation, we modify PE and self-attention to convert LMs (i.e., sequence transformers) to graph transformers that natively operate on graphs, while preserving their LM capabilities. Usually, a new architecture requires pretraining from scratch, which is extremely costly. By adopting some non-invasive changes in the LM\\u2019s self-attention module, we transform the LM to a Graph Transformer (GT) \\u2013 while maintaining compatibility with its pretrained LM parameters. When encoding a graph, LM-like attention patterns process linearly organized textual information of individual triplets, while GT-like attention patterns aggregate information along the graph structure. Hence, the GLM inherits text understanding of triplets from the LM, while its GT architecture allows it to directly perform structural reasoning, without additional GNN layers.\\n\\nImportantly, for text sequences \\u2013 which can be seen as a special type of graph \\u2013 the GLM is identical to the original LM. This allows the GLM to process interleaved inputs of text and GoT jointly, handling both modalities in a single framework.\\nOur main contributions are: (i) We propose Graph Language Models (GLMs) and a theoretical framework to construct them. GLMs are graph transformers, which enables graph reasoning. Simultaneously, they inherit and exploit LM weights, enabling them to represent and contextualize triplets in a GoT. Further, by encoding texts and graph components alike, it can naturally take graph and text data as interleaved inputs. (ii) Experiments on relation classifcation in ConceptNet subgraphs show that GLMs outperform LM- and GNN-based methods for encoding GoTs \\u2013 even when the inherited LM parameters are not updated during GLM training. (iii) KG population experiments on Wikidata subgraphs and corresponding Wikipedia abstracts show that GLMs can reason over interleaved inputs of GoTs and text \\u2013 again, outperforming strong LM-based methods.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"LMs One way to augment LMs with knowledge from KGs (Pan et al., 2024) is to formulate pretraining objectives that operate on a KG. E.g., LMs can be trained to generate parts of a KG, encouraging the LM to store KG content in its parameters. Typically, single triplets are used for pretraining (Bosselut et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2021; West et al., 2023). In such cases, the graph structure is not a target of pretraining. Some works generate larger substructures, such as paths or linearized subgraphs (Wang et al., 2020a; Schmitt et al., 2020; Huguet Cabot and Navigli, 2021). In either case, the LM needs to memorize the KG, as it will not be part of the input during inference.\\nAnother approach is to provide the linearized KG as part of the input during inference. This is common for KG-to-text generation (Schmitt et al., 2020; Ribeiro et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021), where models learn to take the linearized (typically small-sized) graphs as input. A recent trend is retrieval augmented generation, where relevant parts of a knowledge base, or KG, are retrieved, linearized and provided as part of a prompt (Gao et al., 2024).2\\nIn both options the graph must be linearized to ft the input or output of a sequence-to-sequence LM. Hence, no graph priors can be enforced \\u2013 instead, the LM has to learn the graph structure implicitly. By contrast, GLMs model a graph as a true graph and have inductive graph priors instilled in their architecture. This prepares a GLM for more profcient graph reasoning, compared to a LM approach.\\nGNNs LMs excel at representing single triplets, but struggle with structural reasoning. To alleviate this problem, LMs can be combined with GNNs. Many approaches get node and edge features from LMs and aggregate this information in the graph with GNNs (Lin et al., 2019; Malaviya et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023). Zhang et al. (2022); Yasunaga et al. (2022) train models consisting of a LM and a GNN that encode interleaved text and graph inputs jointly. They also use a LM to obtain node features.\\nWhile some approaches jointly train for textual understanding and graph reasoning, none offer a unifed method. By contrast, our GLM formulation seamlessly integrates both in a holistic framework for embedding language and KGs.\\nGraph Transformers GTs, a special type of GNN (Bronstein et al., 2021), gain popularity in NLP and beyond (Min et al., 2022; M\\u00fcller et al., 2023). E.g., Koncel-Kedziorski et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2020b) train GTs to generate text from KGs and AMRs, respectively. Most relevant to our work is Schmitt et al. (2021), who use GTs for KGto-text generation. Similar to us, they employ PE matrices, but train their model from scratch, which limits its applicability: while their model trained on WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) has a vocabulary size of 2,100, initializing a GLM from T5, equips it with T5\\u2019s full vocabulary of 32,128 tokens.\\nConcurrently, and independently from our work, Li et al. (2024) also convert a LM to a graph transformer. They focus on data-to-text generation, where they unify table, key-value and KG structures in a unifed graph format, and apply structureenhanced pre-training to support data-to-text generation with their structure-enhanced transformer model. They apply attention maps similar to ours to better capture the graph-structured input, which the pre-trained model rewrites into natural language. Contrary to their work, we do not resort to structureenhanced pre-training \\u2013 which is restricted in resources \\u2013 but instead assess the GLMs\\u2019 innate capabilities. We showcase the versatility of the inherited LM parameters in conjunction with our graph transformer architecture, by applying them to challenging reasoning tasks, where the model needs to reason over complementary inputs from text and graphs, and where it needs to infer information not present in the input, unlike data-to-text generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that our architectural changes are highly compatible with the original LM weights, via linear probing experiments, where the GLM outperforms conventional LM and Graph Transformer models.\\n\\n3 Preliminary: Graph Transformers (GT) This section briefy introduces graph transformers, focusing on architectural choices relevant for our work. We also discuss some general properties of GNNs that motivate our design choices in $\\\\S4$ .\\nThe attention in self-attention can be written as\\nwhere $Q,K$ and $V$ are the query, key and value matrices, and $d$ is the query and key dimension. The $B_{P}$ and $M$ matrices can be used for positional encoding and masking. Setting $B_{P}=M=0$ yields the standard formulation (Vaswani et al., 2017).\\nPositional Encoding The self-attention mechanism of transformer models is permutation invariant, i.e., it doesn\\u2019t have any notion of the order of its input elements. Thus, positional Encoding (PE) is used to inform LMs of the ordering of tokens in a text (Dufter et al., 2022). Most approaches employ either absolute $P E$ , where absolute token positions are encoded (Vaswani et al., 2017; Gehring et al., 2017) or relative $P E$ , which encodes the relative position between pairs of tokens (Shaw et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021; Press et al., 2022). Absolute PE is typically combined with the input sequence and hence, the PE does not need to be encoded in self-attention $\\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta}B_{P}=0\\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta}$ ). For relative\\nPE, $B_{P}$ encodes a bias depending on the relative distances between pairs of tokens \\u2013 for example, by learning one scalar for each possible distance:\\nwhere $P$ is a matrix of relative distances and $f(\\\\cdot)$ an elementwise function.\\nSimilarly, GTs use PEs to encode the structure of the input, and hence, their PE has to encode a graph structure, as opposed to a sequence. This can again be done with absolute or relative PEs. However, defning an \\u201cabsolute position\\u201d of a node or edge in a graph is not straightforward. While many methods exist, they are not directly compatible with the usual (absolute) \\u201ccounting position\\u201d known from sequence encoding in LMs. In this work we thus focus on relative PE. Given a directed acyclic path in a graph, we can defne the (signed) distance between any pair of nodes along a path simply as the number of hops between the nodes. The sign can be set by the direction of the path. Thus, by fnding a consistent set of such paths in $\\\\S4$ , we obtain relative distances and hence the graph\\u2019s PE.\\nMasked Attention In a vanilla transformer, selfattention is computed for all possible pairs of tokens in the input. By contrast, nodes typically only attend to adjacent nodes in GNNs. Therefore, information between more distant nodes has to be propagated across multiple GNN layers. For graphs, such sparse message passing approaches are sometimes preferred, as in most graphs the neighborhood size increases exponentially with increasing radius, which can cause loss of information due to over-smoothing (Chen et al., 2020). Thus, in GTs it can be benefcial to introduce graph priors, for example by restricting self-attention to local neighborhoods. This can be realized by setting elements of $M$ to 0 for pairs of tokens that should be connected, and to $-\\\\infty$ otherwise.\\nOn the other hand, it has been shown that a global view of the graph can enable effcient, longranged information fow (Alon and Yahav, 2021; Ribeiro et al., 2020). We will therefore present two model variants in $\\\\S4-\\\\mathbf{a}$ local and a global GLM.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Graph Language Model\",\"section_content\":\"GLM vs. GT We aim to design an architecture that can effciently and jointly reason over text and graph-structured data. GTs can offer desired graph priors, but they lack language understanding.\\nOne intuitive approach to bridge this gap is to pretrain a GT from scratch (Schmitt et al., 2021). But pretraining is costly and the necessary data bound to be scarce. We thus take a different avenue. We hypothesize that for reasoning over GoTs a model needs language understanding capabilities similar to those used for reasoning over text. Intuitively this should be the case, since (i) GoTs are designed to be understandable by humans and (ii) literate people can \\u201cread\\u201d and understand GoTs.\\nBy initializing a GT with parameters from a compatible LM, we obtain our Graph Language Model (GLM). The GT architecture introduces graph priors, while parameter initialization from the LM gives it language understanding capabilities. In the following we explain the necessary modifcations to the input graph and to the model, to make this work. The general idea is that (verbalized) triplets should resemble natural language as much as possible to enable LM weights to capture them, while graph reasoning should work via message passing.\\nGraph preprocessing A LM tokenizer converts text into a sequence of tokens from the LM vocabulary. Similarly, we process GoTs, such that the GLM can process the graphs \\u201cas a LM would do\\u201d (cf. Fig. 2). To achieve this, we frst convert the GoT to its so-called Levi graph (Schmitt et al., 2021), i.e., we replace each edge with a node that contains the relation name as text feature, and connect the new node to the head and tail of the original edge via unlabeled edges, preserving the direction of the original edge. Next, we tokenize each node and split each node into multiple nodes, such that every new node corresponds to a single token. New edges connect adjacent nodes, again preserving the original direction. This yields the extended Levi graph (see Fig. 2b). In this representation, each triplet is represented as a sequence of tokens \\u2013 just as it would be for a standard LM.3\\n\\nPositional Encodings As discussed in $\\\\S3$ , we prefer PEs that encode the relative position between pairs of tokens, determined by their signed distance. We can directly adopt this method to encode the relative position between pairs of tokens occurring within the same triplet \\u2013 by simply considering the triplet as a piece of text, and counting the token distance in this text. Note that a single token can occur in multiple triplets, leading to, e.g., multiple \\u201clefthand side neighbors\\u201d (cf. animal in Fig. 2b and 3). While this does not occur in ordinary sequential text, it does not impose a problem for relative PE.\\n\\nYet, the approach above breaks when tokens do not belong to the same triplet. To determine the distance between such pairs of tokens, previous work considered, e.g., the length of the shortest path between them (Schmitt et al., 2021). However, this results in PEs that do not come natural to a LM, since a triplet would appear in reversed order, if it is traversed in \\u201cthe wrong direction\\u201d in the shortest path.4 We therefore omit structure-informed PE between tokens that do not belong to the same triplet and instead propose two GLM variants: a local (\\u2113GLM) and a global $\\\\left(g\\\\mathbf{G}\\\\mathbf{L}\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\right)$ one.\\nLocal and global GLM Fig. 3 shows the relative token position matrix $P$ for the graph in Fig. 2b. In the \\u2113GLM the self-attention mechanism is restricted to tokens from the same triplet. This means that attention to any token located beyond the local triplet is set to 0 \\u2013 and hence does not require PE. Still, in such confgurations, messages can propagate through the graph across multiple layers, since tokens belonging to a concept can be shared by multiple triplets. This is analogous to standard message passing in GNNs, where non-adjacent nodes have no direct connection, but can still share information via message passing. For example, the representation of dog is contextualized by the triplets black poodle is a dog and dog is a animal after the frst \\u2113GLM layer. Hence in the second layer, when animal attends to dog, the animal embedding gets impacted by black poodle, even though there is no direct connection from animal to black poodle.\\nHowever, it has been shown that a global view can have benefts (Ribeiro et al., 2020). Hence, we also formalize the $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ , as an alternative where self-attention can connect any node to every other node. For this setting we need to assign a PE to any pair of tokens, including those that do not occur within the same triplet. For these pairs we introduce a new graph-to-graph (G2G) relative position. LMs don\\u2019t have learned parameters for G2G connections, so we initialize the parameters with the corresponding parameters of a relative position of $+\\\\infty$ . In a LM a relative position of $+\\\\infty$ means that the respective tokens occur somewhere \\u201cfar\\u201d away in a remote text passage. LMs learn a\\nproximity bias during pretraining, i.e., they tend to have higher attention scores between tokens that are close to each other in the text. This means that tokens with a high relative distance tend to have low attention scores. For our $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ this corresponds to a graph bias where distant nodes are less important, but are still accessible.5 Note that unlike in the \\u2113GLM, this bias is not part of the architecture. It originates from the pretrained parameters, meaning that the $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ can learn to attend to distant tokens. Along with $P$ and $M$ , the GLM takes a sequence of all tokens in the extended Levi graph as input. For this, we technically need to \\u201clinearize\\u201d the graph. However, the order of tokens in the resulting sequence does not matter: relative positions in $P$ are determined by distances in the graph, not in the sequence. Permuting the input sequence simply means that rows and columns of $P$ and $M$ need to be permuted accordingly, but the resulting token embeddings remain unchanged. See example matrices for $P$ and $M$ for \\u2113GLM and $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ in $\\\\S\\\\mathrm{A}$ Being transformers, GLMs have the same computational complexity as their respective LM. For sparse graphs the \\u2113GLM could make use of sparse matrix multiplication, making it more effcient than a corresponding LM or $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ . However, for our experiments this was not necessary.\\nJoint graph and text encoding If we use normal matrices for $P$ and $M$ , the GLM is identical to its underlying LM. Hence, GLMs can be applied to texts and \\u2013 more interestingly \\u2013 interleaved inputs of text and graph. In this joint setting, $P$ and $M$ each consists of four sub-matrices that correspond to self-attention between tokens from (i) graph-tograph, (ii) text-to-text, (iii) text-to-graph and (iv) graph-to-text. Graph-to-graph sub-matrices are formatted as described above for \\u2113GLM and $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ , respectively. Text-to-text sub-matrices are standard matrices from conventional sequence transformers. We introduce new T2G and G2T relative positions for text-to-graph, and graph-to-text connections, respectively. With this, the model can learn interaction strength between the two modalities. Similar to G2G in $g\\\\mathrm{GLM}$ , we initialize T2G and G2T parameters from $+\\\\infty$ . See example matrices in $\\\\S\\\\mathrm{A}$ .\\nUni- and Bidirectional LMs If a LM\\u2019s self-attention is unidirectional, information can only propagate along the direction of arrows in Fig. 2b for the \\u2113GLM. This means that, e.g., the representation of the node black poodle is independent of the rest of the graph. We could augment the graph with inverse relations to enable bidirectional information fow with unidirectional LMs, but in this work, we restrict our analysis to bidirectional models.\\n\\nT5 We use T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) \\u2013 a bidirectional encoder with unidirectional decoder \\u2013 as base LM to instantiate GLMs. In T5, relative distances in $P$ group into so-called buckets, and each bucket maps to one learned positional bias in $\\\\boldsymbol{B}_{P}$ for each head. Positional biases are shared across layers. The decoder is not needed to encode graphs, but can be used to generate sequences, such as text or linearized graphs in future work.\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

That being said, early\\nforms of graph neural networks can be traced back at least to the 1990s, with\\nexamples including Alessandro Sperduti\\u2019s Labeling RAAM (Sperduti, 1994),\\nthe \\u201cbackpropagation through structure\\u201d of Goller and Kuchler (1996), and\\nadaptive processing of data structures (Sperduti and Starita, 1997; Frasconi\\net al., 1998). While these works were primarily concerned with operating\\nover \\u201cstructures\\u201d (often trees or directed acyclic graphs), many of the in-\\nvariances preserved in their architectures are reminiscent of the GNNs more\\ncommonly in use today.\\n7. HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE\\n117\\nThe \\ufb01rst proper treatment of the processing of generic graph structures (and\\nthe coining of the term \\u201cgraph neural network\\u201d) happened after the turn of\\nthe 21st century.\\nConcurrently, Alessio Micheli\\nhad proposed the neural\\nnetwork for graphs (NN4G)\\nmodel, which focused on a\\nfeedforward rather than\\nrecurrent paradigm (Micheli,\\n2009).\\nWithin the Arti\\ufb01cial Intelligence lab at the Universit\\u00e0 degli\\nStudi di Siena (Italy), papers led by Marco Gori and Franco Scarselli have\\nproposed the \\ufb01rst \\u201cGNN\\u201d (Gori et al., 2005; Scarselli et al., 2008). They relied\\non recurrent mechanisms, required the neural network parameters to specify\\ncontraction mappings, and thus computing node representations by searching\\nfor a \\ufb01xed point\\u2014this in itself necessitated a special form of backpropagation\\n(Almeida, 1990; Pineda, 1988) and did not depend on node features at all.\\nAll of the above issues were recti\\ufb01ed by the Gated GNN (GGNN) model of\\nLi et al. (2015). GGNNs brought many bene\\ufb01ts of modern RNNs, such as\\ngating mechanisms (Cho et al., 2014) and backpropagation through time, to\\nthe GNN model, and remain popular today.\\nComputational chemistry\\nIt is also very important to note an independent\\nand concurrent line of development for GNNs: one that was entirely driven\\nby the needs of computational chemistry, where molecules are most naturally\\nexpressed as graphs of atoms (nodes) connected by chemical bonds (edges).\\nThis invited computational techniques for molecular property prediction\\nthat operate directly over such a graph structure, which had become present\\nin machine learning in the 1990s: this includes the ChemNet model of Kireev\\n(1995) and the work of Baskin et al. (1997). Strikingly, the \\u201cmolecular graph\\nnetworks\\u201d of Merkwirth and Lengauer (2005) explicitly proposed many\\nof the elements commonly found in contemporary GNNs\\u2014such as edge\\ntype-conditioned weights or global pooling\\u2014as early as 2005. The chemi-\\ncal motivation continued to drive GNN development into the 2010s, with\\ntwo signi\\ufb01cant GNN advancements centered around improving molecular\\n\\ufb01ngerprinting (Duvenaud et al., 2015) and predicting quantum-chemical\\nproperties (Gilmer et al., 2017) from small molecules. At the time of writing\\nthis text, molecular property prediction is one of the most successful applica-\\ntions of GNNs, with impactful results in virtual screening of new antibiotic\\ndrugs (Stokes et al., 2020).\\nNode embeddings\\nSome of the earliest success stories of deep learning\\non graphs involve learning representations of nodes in an unsupervised\\nfashion, based on the graph structure. Given their structural inspiration,\\nthis direction also provides one of the most direct links between graph\\nrepresentation learning and network science communities. The key early\\n118\\nBRONSTEIN, BRUNA, COHEN & VELI\\u010cKOVI\\u0106\\napproaches in this space relied on random walk-based embeddings: learning\\nnode representations in a way that brings them closer together if the nodes co-\\noccur in a short random walk. Representative methods in this space include\\nDeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016) and\\nLINE (Tang et al., 2015), which are all purely self-supervised. Planetoid\\n(Yang et al., 2016) was the \\ufb01rst in this space to incorporate supervision label\\ninformation, when it is available.\\nUnifying random walk objectives with GNN encoders\\nRecently, a theoretical\\nframework was developed by\\nSrinivasan and Ribeiro (2019)\\nin which the equivalence of\\nstructural and positional\\nrepresentations was\\ndemonstrated. Additionally,\\nQiu et al. (2018) have\\ndemonstrated that all\\nrandom-walk based\\nembedding techniques are\\nequivalent to an\\nappropriately-posed matrix\\nfactorisation task.\\nwas attempted on sev-\\neral occasions, with representative approaches including Variational Graph\\nAutoencoder (VGAE, Kipf and Welling (2016b)), embedding propagation\\n(Garc\\u00eda-Dur\\u00e1n and Niepert, 2017), and unsupervised variants of GraphSAGE\\n(Hamilton et al., 2017). However, this was met with mixed results, and it was\\nshortly discovered that pushing neighbouring node representations together\\nis already a key part of GNNs\\u2019 inductive bias. Indeed, it was shown that\\nan untrained GNN was already showing performance that is competitive\\nwith DeepWalk, in settings where node features are available (Veli\\u010dkovi\\u0107\\net al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019). This launched a direction that moves away\\nfrom combining random walk objectives with GNNs and shifting towards\\ncontrastive approaches inspired by mutual information maximisation and\\naligning to successful methods in the image domain. Prominent examples of\\nthis direction include Deep Graph Informax (DGI, Veli\\u010dkovi\\u0107 et al. (2019)),\\nGRACE (Zhu et al., 2020), BERT-like objectives (Hu et al., 2020) and BGRL\\n(Thakoor et al., 2021).\\nProbabilistic graphical models\\nGraph neural networks have also, con-\\ncurrently, resurged through embedding the computations of probabilistic\\ngraphical models (PGMs, Wainwright and Jordan (2008)). PGMs are a pow-\\nerful tool for processing graphical data, and their utility arises from their\\nprobabilistic perspective on the graph\\u2019s edges: namely, the nodes are treated\\nas random variables, while the graph structure encodes conditional indepen-\\ndence assumptions, allowing for signi\\ufb01cantly simplifying the calculation and\\nsampling from the joint distribution. Indeed, many algorithms for (exactly\\nor approximately) supporting learning and inference on PGMs rely on forms\\nof passing messages over their edges (Pearl, 2014), with examples including\\nvariational mean-\\ufb01eld inference and loopy belief propagation (Yedidia et al.,\\n2001; Murphy et al., 2013).\\nThis connection between PGMs and message passing was subsequently\\n7. HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE\\n119\\ndeveloped into GNN architectures, with early theoretical links established\\nby the authors of structure2vec (Dai et al., 2016). Namely, by posing a\\ngraph representation learning setting as a Markov random \\ufb01eld (of nodes\\ncorresponding to input features and latent representations), the authors\\ndirectly align the computation of both mean-\\ufb01eld inference and loopy belief\\npropagation to a model not unlike the GNNs commonly in use today.\\nThe key \\u201ctrick\\u201d which allowed for relating the latent representations of a\\nGNN to probability distributions maintained by a PGM was the usage of\\nHilbert-space embeddings of distributions (Smola et al., 2007). Given \\u03c6, an ap-\\npropriately chosen embedding function for features x, it is possible to embed\\ntheir probability distribution p(x) as the expected embedding Ex\\u223cp(x)\\u03c6(x).\\nSuch a correspondence allows us to perform GNN-like computations, know-\\ning that the representations computed by the GNN will always correspond\\nto an embedding of some probability distribution over the node features.\\nThe structure2vec model itself is, ultimately, a GNN architecture which\\neasily sits within our framework, but its setup has inspired a series of GNN\\narchitectures which more directly incorporate computations found in PGMs.\\nEmerging examples have successfully combined GNNs with conditional\\nrandom \\ufb01elds (Gao et al., 2019; Spalevi\\u0107 et al., 2020), relational Markov\\nnetworks (Qu et al., 2019) and Markov logic networks (Zhang et al., 2020).\\nThe Weisfeiler-Lehman formalism\\nThe resurgence of graph neural net-\\nworks was followed closely by a drive to understand their fundamental\\nlimitations, especially in terms of expressive power.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are essential for organizing vast data, to facilitate information retrieval, or revealing hidden insights for decisionmaking (Plenz et al., 2024). KGs excel in explicitly representing manifold relationships, so with an expanding wealth of information they become crucial tools in the digital age.\\nMany KGs consist of knowledge triplets, where nodes are entities and edges represent relationships holding between them. Each triplet represents a fact in pseudo-natural language, e.g., (Thailand; Capital; Bangkok) in DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007). Despite the (usual) simplicity of each individual triplet, complex structures emerge in KGs. We refer to such KGs as Graphs of Triplets (GoTs).\\n\\nTo use GoTs effectively, we need meaningful encodings of their components. A natural choice is leveraging LMs, as they can capture the semantics of textually encoded entities, relations or entire triplets. But LMs are not prepared to capture graphstructured information and cannot model complex interactions in a GoT. To alleviate this problem, one can leverage graph NNs (GNNs). But GNNs are not well suited to capture meanings associated with text, and hence often LMs are used to convert nodes (and possibly edges) to language-based semantic embeddings. But in such settings, semantic encoding leveraged from LMs and structural reasoning performed by GNNs are separated and are driven by distinct underlying principles. We expect this to limit model performance if both textual and structural information are important for a task.\\nIn this work we introduce a Graph Language Model (GLM) that resolves this tension through early fusion of textual and structural information. Most LMs today are transformers. Since transformers operate on sets, Positional Encoding (PE) is used to inform them about the inherent sequential ordering of linguistic inputs. In our GLM formulation, we modify PE and self-attention to convert LMs (i.e., sequence transformers) to graph transformers that natively operate on graphs, while preserving their LM capabilities. Usually, a new architecture requires pretraining from scratch, which is extremely costly. By adopting some non-invasive changes in the LM\\u2019s self-attention module, we transform the LM to a Graph Transformer (GT) \\u2013 while maintaining compatibility with its pretrained LM parameters. When encoding a graph, LM-like attention patterns process linearly organized textual information of individual triplets, while GT-like attention patterns aggregate information along the graph structure. Hence, the GLM inherits text understanding of triplets from the LM, while its GT architecture allows it to directly perform structural reasoning, without additional GNN layers.\\n\\nImportantly, for text sequences \\u2013 which can be seen as a special type of graph \\u2013 the GLM is identical to the original LM. This allows the GLM to process interleaved inputs of text and GoT jointly, handling both modalities in a single framework.\\nOur main contributions are: (i) We propose Graph Language Models (GLMs) and a theoretical framework to construct them. GLMs are graph transformers, which enables graph reasoning. Simultaneously, they inherit and exploit LM weights, enabling them to represent and contextualize triplets in a GoT. Further, by encoding texts and graph components alike, it can naturally take graph and text data as interleaved inputs. (ii) Experiments on relation classifcation in ConceptNet subgraphs show that GLMs outperform LM- and GNN-based methods for encoding GoTs \\u2013 even when the inherited LM parameters are not updated during GLM training. (iii) KG population experiments on Wikidata subgraphs and corresponding Wikipedia abstracts show that GLMs can reason over interleaved inputs of GoTs and text \\u2013 again, outperforming strong LM-based methods.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"LMs One way to augment LMs with knowledge from KGs (Pan et al., 2024) is to formulate pretraining objectives that operate on a KG. E.g., LMs can be trained to generate parts of a KG, encouraging the LM to store KG content in its parameters. Typically, single triplets are used for pretraining (Bosselut et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2021; Hwang et al., 2021; West et al., 2023). In such cases, the graph structure is not a target of pretraining. Some works generate larger substructures, such as paths or linearized subgraphs (Wang et al., 2020a; Schmitt et al., 2020; Huguet Cabot and Navigli, 2021). In either case, the LM needs to memorize the KG, as it will not be part of the input during inference.\\nAnother approach is to provide the linearized KG as part of the input during inference. This is common for KG-to-text generation (Schmitt et al., 2020; Ribeiro et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021), where models learn to take the linearized (typically small-sized) graphs as input. A recent trend is retrieval augmented generation, where relevant parts of a knowledge base, or KG, are retrieved, linearized and provided as part of a prompt (Gao et al., 2024).2\\nIn both options the graph must be linearized to ft the input or output of a sequence-to-sequence LM. Hence, no graph priors can be enforced \\u2013 instead, the LM has to learn the graph structure implicitly. By contrast, GLMs model a graph as a true graph and have inductive graph priors instilled in their architecture. This prepares a GLM for more profcient graph reasoning, compared to a LM approach.\\nGNNs LMs excel at representing single triplets, but struggle with structural reasoning. To alleviate this problem, LMs can be combined with GNNs. Many approaches get node and edge features from LMs and aggregate this information in the graph with GNNs (Lin et al., 2019; Malaviya et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023). Zhang et al. (2022); Yasunaga et al. (2022) train models consisting of a LM and a GNN that encode interleaved text and graph inputs jointly. They also use a LM to obtain node features.\\nWhile some approaches jointly train for textual understanding and graph reasoning, none offer a unifed method. By contrast, our GLM formulation seamlessly integrates both in a holistic framework for embedding language and KGs.\\nGraph Transformers GTs, a special type of GNN (Bronstein et al., 2021), gain popularity in NLP and beyond (Min et al., 2022; M\\u00fcller et al., 2023). E.g., Koncel-Kedziorski et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2020b) train GTs to generate text from KGs and AMRs, respectively. Most relevant to our work is Schmitt et al. (2021), who use GTs for KGto-text generation. Similar to us, they employ PE matrices, but train their model from scratch, which limits its applicability: while their model trained on WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) has a vocabulary size of 2,100, initializing a GLM from T5, equips it with T5\\u2019s full vocabulary of 32,128 tokens.\\nConcurrently, and independently from our work, Li et al. (2024) also convert a LM to a graph transformer. They focus on data-to-text generation, where they unify table, key-value and KG structures in a unifed graph format, and apply structureenhanced pre-training to support data-to-text generation with their structure-enhanced transformer model. They apply attention maps similar to ours to better capture the graph-structured input, which the pre-trained model rewrites into natural language. Contrary to their work, we do not resort to structureenhanced pre-training \\u2013 which is restricted in resources \\u2013 but instead assess the GLMs\\u2019 innate capabilities. We showcase the versatility of the inherited LM parameters in conjunction with our graph transformer architecture, by applying them to challenging reasoning tasks, where the model needs to reason over complementary inputs from text and graphs, and where it needs to infer information not present in the input, unlike data-to-text generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that our architectural changes are highly compatible with the original LM weights, via linear probing experiments, where the GLM outperforms conventional LM and Graph Transformer models.\\n\\n3 Preliminary: Graph Transformers (GT) This section briefy introduces graph transformers, focusing on architectural choices relevant for our work. We also discuss some general properties of GNNs that motivate our design choices in $\\\\S4$ .\\nThe attention in self-attention can be written as\\nwhere $Q,K$ and $V$ are the query, key and value matrices, and $d$ is the query and key dimension. The $B_{P}$ and $M$ matrices can be used for positional encoding and masking. Setting $B_{P}=M=0$ yields the standard formulation (Vaswani et al., 2017).\\nPositional Encoding The self-attention mechanism of transformer models is permutation invariant, i.e., it doesn\\u2019t have any notion of the order of its input elements. Thus, positional Encoding (PE) is used to inform LMs of the ordering of tokens in a text (Dufter et al., 2022). Most approaches employ either absolute $P E$ , where absolute token positions are encoded (Vaswani et al., 2017; Gehring et al., 2017) or relative $P E$ , which encodes the relative position between pairs of tokens (Shaw et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020; Su et al., 2021; Press et al., 2022). Absolute PE is typically combined with the input sequence and hence, the PE does not need to be encoded in self-attention $\\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta}B_{P}=0\\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta}$ ). For relative\\nPE, $B_{P}$ encodes a bias depending on the relative distances between pairs of tokens \\u2013 for example, by learning one scalar for each possible distance:\\nwhere $P$ is a matrix of relative distances and $f(\\\\cdot)$ an elementwise function.\\nSimilarly, GTs use PEs to encode the structure of the input, and hence, their PE has to encode a graph structure, as opposed to a sequence. This can again be done with absolute or relative PEs. However, defning an \\u201cabsolute position\\u201d of a node or edge in a graph is not straightforward. While many methods exist, they are not directly compatible with the usual (absolute) \\u201ccounting position\\u201d known from sequence encoding in LMs. In this work we thus focus on relative PE. Given a directed acyclic path in a graph, we can defne the (signed) distance between any pair of nodes along a path simply as the number of hops between the nodes. The sign can be set by the direction of the path. Thus, by fnding a consistent set of such paths in $\\\\S4$ , we obtain relative distances and hence the graph\\u2019s PE.\\nMasked Attention In a vanilla transformer, selfattention is computed for all possible pairs of tokens in the input. By contrast, nodes typically only attend to adjacent nodes in GNNs. Therefore, information between more distant nodes has to be propagated across multiple GNN layers. For graphs, such sparse message passing approaches are sometimes preferred, as in most graphs the neighborhood size increases exponentially with increasing radius, which can cause loss of information due to over-smoothing (Chen et al., 2020). Thus, in GTs it can be benefcial to introduce graph priors, for example by restricting self-attention to local neighborhoods. This can be realized by setting elements of $M$ to 0 for pairs of tokens that should be connected, and to $-\\\\infty$ otherwise.\\nOn the other hand, it has been shown that a global view of the graph can enable effcient, longranged information fow (Alon and Yahav, 2021; Ribeiro et al., 2020). We will therefore present two model variants in $\\\\S4-\\\\mathbf{a}$ local and a global GLM.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5.1.2 Baselines\",\"section_content\":\"We compare to several baselines inspired by related work. For all baselines we utilize the T5 encoder as underlying LM. This allows us to focus on the architectural design of different model types.\\nLM For LM-based approaches we linearize the input graphs to a sequence, by concatenating the verbalized triplets. There are structured ways to linearize graphs, but such graph traversals generally require the graph to be directed and acyclic \\u2013 which makes them inapplicable to linearizing GoTs. Instead, we order the triplets either randomly (T5 set) or alphabetically (T5 list). For T5 set, triplets are shuffed randomly in every training epoch such that the model can learn to generalize to unseen orderings. The concatenated triplets are passed to the T5 encoder, and the embedding of <extra_id_0> is presented to the classifcation head.\\nGNN For GNN baselines we encode each node of the original graph (cf. Fig. 2a) with the T5 encoder, and train a GNN using these static embeddings. After the fnal layer, the GNN returns 17 logits for each node. As fnal logits, we take the mean logit of the two nodes adjacent to the relation to be predicted. We experiment with different variants as GNN layers: GCN (Kipf and Welling, 2017) and GAT (Velic\\u02c7kovic\\u00b4 et al., 2018). Since GNNs do not come with pretrained weights, we only apply them in fnetuning, when training all parameters.\\n\\nGraph transformer Finally we compare GLMs to models with the same architecture, but random weight initialization (normal graph transformers). This allows us to assess the impact of weight initialization from a LM with two further baselines: \\u2113GT and $\\\\pmb{g}\\\\mathbf{G}\\\\mathbf{T}$ .
