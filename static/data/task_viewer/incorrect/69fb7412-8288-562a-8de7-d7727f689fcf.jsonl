{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Next, we extend the original DSL to include three additional functional sub-modules within the semantic parsing module, namely add, remove, and change. Refer to appendix section A for details on the DSL. We now reset the semantic parsing module and train it again from scratch for generating programs corresponding to image manipulation instruction text $T$ . Such a program is subsequently used by the downstream pipeline to reason over the scene graph $G_{I}$ and manipulate the image. In this step, the semantic parser is trained using an offpolicy program search based REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) algorithm. Unlike the training of semantic parser for the VQA task, in this step, we do not have any fnal answer like reward supervision for training. Hence, we resort to a weaker form of supervision. In particular, consider an input instruction text $T$ and set of all possible manipulation program templates $\\\\mathbb{P}_{t}$ from which one can create any actual program $P$ that is executable over the scene graph of the input image. For a program $P\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}_{t}$ , our reward is positive if this program $P$ selects any object (or part of the scene graph) to be sent to the manipulation networks (change\\/add\\/remove). See Appendix C for more details. Once the semantic parser is retrained, we clamp the frst three modules and continue using them for the purpose of parsing instructions and converting images into their scene graph representations. Scene graphs are manipulated using our novel module called manipulation network which is described next.\\n\\n4] Manipulation Network: This is our key module responsible for carrying out the manipulation operations. We allow three kinds of manipulation operations \\u2013 add, remove, and change. Each of these operations is a composition of a quasi-symbolic and symbolic operation. A symbolic operation corresponds to a function that performs the required structural changes (i.e. addition\\/deletion of a node or an edge) in the scene graph $G_{I}$ against a given instruction. A quasi-symbolic operation is a dedicated neural network that takes the relevant part of $G_{I}$ as input and computes new representations of nodes and edges that are compatible with the changes described in the parsed instruction.\\n(a) Change Network: For each visual attribute $a\\\\in A$ (e.g. shape, size, . . . ), we have a separate change neural network that takes the pair of (object embedding, embedding of the changed concept) as input and outputs the embedding of the changed object. This is the quasi-symbolic part of the change function, while the symbolic part is identity mapping. For e.g., let $g_{\\\\mathrm{color}}:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\mathrm{obj}}+d_{\\\\mathrm{attr}}}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\mathrm{obj}}}$ represent the neural network that changes the color of an object. Consider $o\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\mathrm{obj}}}$ as the object embedding and $c_{\\\\mathrm{red}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\mathrm{attr}}}$ as the concept embedding for the red color, then $\\\\widetilde{o}=g_{\\\\mathrm{color}}(o;c_{\\\\mathrm{red}})\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\\\mathrm{obj}}}$ represents the changed  o bject embedding, whose color would be red. After applying the change neural network, we obtain the changed representation of the object $\\\\widetilde{o}=g_{a}(o;c_{s_{a}^{*}})$ , where $s_{a}^{*}$ is the desired changed v a lue for the attribute $a$ . This network is trained using the following losses.\\nwhere, $h_{a}(x)$ gives the concept value of the attribute $a$ (in symbolic form $\\\\begin{array}{r l r}{s}&{{}\\\\in}&{S_{a})}\\\\end{array}$ for the object $x$ . The quantity $p\\\\left(h_{a}(x)=s\\\\right)$ denotes the probability that the concept value of the attribute $a$ for the object $x$ is equal to $s$ and is given as follows $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{p\\\\left(h_{a}(x)=s\\\\right)}&{{}=}\\\\end{array}$ $\\\\exp^{d i s t(f_{a}(x),c_{s})}\\/{\\\\sum_{\\\\widetilde{s}\\\\in S_{a}}\\\\exp^{d i s t(f_{a}(x),c_{\\\\widetilde{s}})}}$ where, $d i s t(a,b)\\\\ =\\\\ (a^{\\\\top}b\\\\,-\\\\,t_{2})\\/t_{1}$ is the shifted and scaled cosine similarity, $t_{1},t_{2}$ being constants. The frst loss term $\\\\ell_{a}$ penalizes the model if the (symbolic) value of the attribute $a$ for the manipulated object is different from the desired value $s_{a}^{*}$ in terms of probabilities. The second term $\\\\ell_{\\\\overline{{a}}}$ , on the other hand, penalizes the model if the values of any of the other attributes $a^{\\\\prime}$ , deviate from their original values. Apart from these losses, we also include following additional losses.\\n\\nwhere $c_{o l d}$ is the original value of the attribute $a$ of object $o$ , before undergoing change. Intuitively the frst loss term $\\\\ell_{\\\\mathrm{cycle}}$ says that, changing an object and then changing it back should result in the same object. The second loss term \\u2113consistency intuitively means that changing an object $o$ that has value $c_{o l d}$ for attribute $a$ , into a new object with the same value $c_{o l d}$ , should not result in any change. These additional losses prevent the change network from changing attributes which are not explicitly taken care of in earlier losses (1) and (2). For e.g., rotation or location attributes of the objects that are not part of our DSL. We also impose an adversarial loss $\\\\ell_{\\\\mathrm{objGAN}}$ to ensure that the new object embedding $\\\\widetilde{o}$ is from the same distribution as real object emb e ddings. See Appendix C for more details.\\n(b) Remove Network: This network takes the scene graph $G_{I}$ of the input image and removes the subgraph from $G_{I}$ that contains the nodes (and incident edges) corresponding to the object(s) that need to be removed, and returns a new scene graph $G_{\\\\widetilde{I}}$ which is reduced in size. The quasi-symbolic fu nction for the remove network is identity.\\n(c) Add Network: For adding a new object into the scene, add network requires the symbolic values of different attributes, say $\\\\left\\\\{s_{a_{1}},s_{a_{2}},\\\\ldots,s_{a_{k}}\\\\right\\\\}$ , for the new object, e.g., {red, cylinder, . . .}. It also requires the spatial relation $r$ (e.g. RightOf) of the new object with respect to an existing object in the scene. The add function frst predicts the object (node) embedding $\\\\widetilde{O}_{\\\\mathrm{new}}$ for the object to be added, followed by pred ic ting edge embeddings for new edges incident on the new node. New object embedding is obtained as follows: $\\\\widetilde{o}_{\\\\mathrm{new}}=$ $g_{\\\\mathrm{addObj}}\\\\big(\\\\{c_{s_{a_{1}}},c_{s_{a_{2}}},\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot,c_{s_{a_{k}}}\\\\},o_{r e l},c_{r}\\\\big)$ wh er e, $o_{r e l}$ is the object embedding of an existing object, relative to which the new object\\u2019s position $r$ is specifed. For each existing objects $o_{i}$ in the scene, an edge $\\\\widetilde{e}_{\\\\mathrm{new},i}$ is predicted between the newly added objec t $\\\\widetilde{O}_{\\\\mathrm{new}}$ and existing object $o_{i}$ in following manne r: $\\\\widetilde{e}_{\\\\mathrm{new},i}~=~g_{\\\\mathrm{addEdge}}(\\\\widetilde{o}_{\\\\mathrm{new}},o_{i})$ . Functions $g_{\\\\mathrm{addobj}}(\\\\cdot)$ a nd $g_{\\\\mathrm{{addEdge}}}(\\\\cdot)$ are q uasi-symbolic operations. Symbolic operations in add network comprise adding the above node and the incident edges into the scene graph.\\n\\nThe add network is trained in a self-supervised manner. For this, we pick a training image and create its scene graph. Next, we randomly select an object $o$ from this image and quantize its concepts, along with a relation with any other object $o_{i}$ in the same image. We then use our remove network to remove this object $o$ from the scene. Finally, we use the quantized concepts and the relation that were gathered above and add this object $o$ back into the scene graph using $g_{\\\\mathrm{addobj}}(\\\\cdot)$ and $g_{\\\\mathrm{{addEdge}}}(\\\\cdot)$ . Let the embedding of the object after adding it back is $\\\\widetilde{O}_{\\\\mathrm{new}}$ . The training losses are as follows:\\nwhich is the processed by a GCN and passed through a mask regression network followed by a box regression network to generate a coarse 2- dimensional structure (scene layout). A Cascaded Refnement Network (Chen and Koltun, 2017) is then employed to generate an image from the scene layout. A min-max adversarial training procedure is used to generate realistic images, using a patchbased and object-based discriminator.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"C.2 Manipulation Network\",\"section_content\":\"In what follows, we provide fner details of manipulation network components.\\nChange Network: As described in Section 3.3 of the main paper, we have a change neural network for each attribute. For changing the current attribute value of a given object $o$ , we use the following neural network: $\\\\widetilde{o}=g_{a}(o;c_{s_{a}^{*}})$ , where $s_{a}^{*}$ is the desired changed v a lue for the attribute $a$ . $\\\\widetilde{o}$ is the new representation of the object. We mod e l $g_{a}(\\\\cdot)$ by a single layer neural network without having any non-linearity. The input dimension of this neural network is $(256+64)$ because we concatenate the object representation $\\\\boldsymbol{o}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{256}$ with the desired concept representation $d\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{64}$ . We pass this concatenated vector through $g_{a}(\\\\cdot)$ to get the revised representation of the object: o \\u2208 R256.\\nThe loss used to train the weights  o f the change network is a weighted sum of losses equation 1 to equation 5 given in the main paper.

This discriminator is trained using standard GAN objective $\\\\ell_{\\\\mathrm{objGAN}}$ . See Fig 5a for an overview of the change operator\\nRemove Network: The remove network is a symbolic operation as described in Section 3.3 of the main paper. That is, given an input set of objects, the remove operation deletes the subgraph of the scene graph that contains the nodes corresponding to removed objects and the edges incident on those nodes. See Fig 5c for an overview of the remove operator.\\nAdd Network: The neural operation in the add operator comprises of predicting the object representation for the newly added object using a function $g_{\\\\mathrm{addobj}}(\\\\cdot)$ . This function is modeled as a single layer neural network without any activation. The input to this network is a concatenated vector $[[c_{s_{a_{1}}},c_{s_{a_{2}}},\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot,c_{s_{a_{k}}}],o_{r e l},c_{r}]$ where $\\\\left[c_{s_{a_{1}}},c_{s_{a_{2}}},\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot,c_{s_{a_{k}}}\\\\right]$ represents the concatenation of all the concept vectors of the desired new objects. The vector $o_{r e l}$ is the representation of the object with whom the relation (i.e. position) of the new object has been specifed and $c_{r}$ is the concept vector for that relationship. The input dimension of $g_{\\\\mathrm{addobj}}(\\\\cdot)$ is $(k*64+256+64)$ and the output dimension is 256. For predicting representation of newly added edges in the scene graph, we use edge predictor $g_{\\\\mathrm{{addEdge}}}(\\\\cdot)$ . The input to this edge predictor function is the concatenated representation of the objects which are linked by the edge. The input dimension of $g_{\\\\mathrm{{addEdge}}}(\\\\cdot)$ is $(256+256)$ and the output dimension is 256.\\nThe loss used to train the add network weights is a weighted sum of losses equation 6 to equation 10 along with an object discriminator loss.

Through this experiment, our is to demonstrate that NEUROSIM is highly effective in solving this task as well. In what follows, we provide details about this task, baselines, evaluation metric, how we adapted NEUROSIM for this task, and fnally performance results in Table 12. This table is a detailed version of the Table 4 in the main paper.\\nTask Defnition: Given an Image $I$ , a text instruction $T$ , and a database of images $D$ , the task is to retrieve an image from the database that is semantically as close to the ground truth manipulated image as possible.\\nNote, for each such $(I,T)$ pair, some image from the database, say $\\\\widetilde{I}\\\\in\\\\dot{D}$ , is assumed to be the ideal image that shou ld  ideally be retrieved at rank-1. This, so called desired gold retrieval image might even be an image which is the ideal manipulated version of the original images $I$ in terms of satisfying the instruction $T$ perfectly. Or, image I may not be such an ideal manipulated image but  i t still may be the image in whole corpus $D$ that comes closest to the ideal manipulated image.\\nIn practice, while measuring the performance of any such system for this task, the gold manipulated image for $(I,T)$ pair is typically inserted into the database $D$ and such an image then serves as the desired gold retrieval image I.\\nBaselines: Our baselines includes popular supervised learning systems designed for this task. The frst baseline is TIRG proposed by Vo et al. (2019) where they combine image and text to get a joint embedding and train their model in a supervised manner using embedding of the desired retrieved image as supervision. For completeness, we also include comparison with other baselines \\u2013 Concat, Image-Only, and Text-Only \\u2013 that were introduced by Vo et al. (2019).\\nA recent model proposed by Chen et al. (2020) uses symbolic scene graphs (instead of embeddings) to retrieve images from the database. Motivated by this, we also retrieve images via the scene graph that is generated by the manipulation module of NEUROSIM. However, unlike Chen et al. (2020), the nodes and edges in our scene graph have associated vectors and make a novel use of them while retrieving. We do not compare our performance with (Chen et al., 2020) since its code is unavailable and we haven\\u2019t been able to reproduce their numbers on datasets used in their paper. Moreover, (Chen et al., 2020) uses full supervision of the desired output image (which is converted to a symbolic scene graph), while we do not.\\nEvaluation Metric: We use Recall $@k$ (and report results for $k=1,3,$ ) for evaluating the performance of text guided image retrieval algorithms which is standard in the literature.\\nRetrieval using Scene Graphs: We use the scene graph generated by NEUROSIM as the latent representation to retrieve images from the database. We introduce a novel yet simple method to retrieve images using scene graph representation. For converting an image into the scene graph, we use the visual representation network of NEUROSIM. Given the scene graph $G$ for the input image $I$ and the manipulation instruction text $T$ , NEUROSIM converts the scene graph into the changed scene graph $G_{\\\\widetilde{I}},$ as described in Section C in Appendix. Now, we  use this graph $G_{\\\\widetilde{I}}$ as a query to retrieve images from the databas e $D$ . For retrieval, we use the novel graph edit distance (GED) between $G_{\\\\widetilde{I}}$ and the scene graph representation of the database images. The scene graph for each database image is also obtained using the visual representation network of NEUROSIM. The graph edit distance is given below.\\n\\nwhere, $G_{\\\\widetilde{I}}\\\\;=\\\\;(N_{\\\\widetilde{I}},V_{\\\\widetilde{I}})$ and $G_{D}~=~(N_{D},V_{D})$ $n_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ a re the no de  embeddings of the query graph $G_{\\\\widetilde{I}}$ and scene graph $G_{D}$ of an image from the datab ase. $c(a,b)$ is the cosine similarities between embeddings $a$ and $b$ . This GED is much simpler than that defned in (Chen et al., 2020), since it does not need any hand designed cost for change, removal, or addition of nodes, or different attribute values. It can simply rely on the cosine similarities between node embeddings. We use the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) for calculating the optimal matching $\\\\pi$ of the nodes, among all possible matching \\u03a0. We use the negative of the cosine similarity scores between nodes to create the cost matrix for the Hungarian algorithm to process. This simple yet highly effective approach (See Table 4 in the main paper and Table 12 in the appendix), can be improved by more sophisticated techniques that include distance between edge embeddings and including notion of subgraphs in the GED. We leave this as future work. This result shows that our manipulation network edits the scene graph in a desirable manner, as per the input instruction.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"H.3 Training Manipulation Networks\",\"section_content\":\"The architecture details of the manipulation network are present in Section C of this appendix. We use batch size of 32, learning rate of $10^{-3}$ , and optimize using AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) with weight decay of $10^{-4}$ . Rest of the hyperparameters are kept the same as used in (Mao et al., 2019). During training, at every $5^{t h}$ epochs, we calculate the manipulation accuracy by using the query networks that were trained while training the NEUROSIM on VQA data. This serves as a proxy to the validation accuracy.\\n\\u2022 For the change network training, we use the query accuracy of whether the attribute that was supposed to change for a particular object, has changed correctly or not. Also, whether any other attribute has changed or not.\\n\\u2022 For the add network training, we use the query accuracy of whether the attributes of the added object are correct or not. Also, whether the added object is in a correct relation with reference object or not.\\nWe obtained a validation accuracy (based on querying) of $95.9\\\\%$ for the add network and an accuracy of $99.1\\\\%$ for the change network.\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
