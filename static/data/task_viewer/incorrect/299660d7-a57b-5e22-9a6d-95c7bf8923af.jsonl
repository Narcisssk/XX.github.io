{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "[Question]: What's the difference between the methods to convert GUI usage tutorials into trajectories of Synatra and AgentTrek? Which performance on WebArena of 7B model is better? How much of success rate does the better one outperforms the other one by?\n[Answer Format]: Your answer should be a list of three elements. The first element should be a string of free-form natural English describing the difference between methods of two works. The second element should be a string from [\"Synatra\", \"AgentTrek\"]. The third element should be a float in [0, 100] as the difference of the success rates of two models.\n[Anchor PDFs]: ['d7056732-f450-58dc-ac5f-9829b1393481', '3d346e23-8d40-53fb-9c92-e8c831e82a5b']\n[Database Schema]: The database schema for /home/htc981/workspace/project/HNS-RAG/data/database/ai_research/ai_research.sql is as follows:\n/* database ai_research: This database contains information about AI research papers.

Typically, supervised\\nfinetuning is a standard way to adapt large language models (LLMs) to tasks such as text generation\\nor classification, large-scale demonstration collections for digital agents are not readily available.\\nFor AI agents, demonstrations typically involve specifying a sequence of actions and observations\\nthat results in successful task completion, as shown on the right of Figure 1. Existing works that\\nautomatically collect demonstrations (1) set up environments for an agent to interact with, (2) run\\na baseline agent within this environment, and (3) employ scoring functions to remove low quality\\ndemonstrations [9] or perform relabeling [1, 26].

The sources comprise\\nonly indirect knowledge (left of the arrow), such as tutorials designed for human consumption and\\nrandomly sampled observations that lack associated tasks and actions.\\nenvironments in which we would like agents to act is a difficult task, and existing environments\\nfor digital agents are generally limited in scope to a few websites or digital apps [58, 7, 45]. Even\\nwithin these constrained settings, strong LLMs such as GPT-4 struggle on tackling tasks [58], making\\ncollecting successful demonstrations with LLMs inefficient. In addition, human annotation is costly\\nand its scope can still be limited [17, 6]. For example, gathering a demonstration for canceling a\\nPayPal order requires an actual PayPal account with a legitimate subscription history.\\nIn this work, we propose Synatra, a data generation approach that synthesizes high-quality tra-\\njectories for complex digital tasks at scale. This approach is based on the intuition that there is\\na rich trove of existing knowledge that encodes indirect supervision about how to perform digital\\ntasks (\\u00a72.2). One example of a piece of indirect knowledge is a tutorial that details the sequential\\nbreakdown of a complex web task, such as \\u201chow to cancel a recurring payment on Paypal\\u201d for human\\nreaders (Figure 1 upper left) [53, 57]. While this tutorial provides some procedural guidance, such as\\n\\u201cEnter the keyword,\\u201d it does not specify the executable actions or the tangible observations associated\\nwith them. The key idea of Synatra is that, given this indirect knowledge, we can leverage an LLM\\nto re-purpose it into more usable form that directly demonstrates the exact action to take given a\\nconcrete observation (\\u00a73). In doing so, we leverage LLMs\\u2019 ability to paraphrase and code, as well as\\nits general knowledge of how tasks are performed (Figure 1). The main benefit of this approach is\\nthat it can scale with the availability of indirect knowledge created for humans, rather than rely on\\ndirect human annotations or LLM trajectories.\\nWe carefully study the sources of indirect knowledge, the design of demonstration formats, and\\nthe mechanisms for iterative refinement in order to synthesize high-quality demonstrations using\\nan LLM (\\u00a73, \\u00a74). We generate demonstrations of 100k tasks from 21 domains, and finetune a 7b\\nCodellama-instruct model with this synthetic data. The resulting agent, Synatra-CodeLlama,\\nsurpasses existing open-source models of similar size, excluding those finetuned with human annota-\\ntions, on three web-based task benchmarks: Mind2Web, MiniWoB++, and WebArena. Moreover, it\\nconsistently outperforms models that are ten times larger and have been finetuned with interactive\\ndata (\\u00a76.1). Our findings also indicate that our model is on-par or a more accurate option in browser\\ncopilot settings, in comparison to GPT-3.5. Importantly, while each synthetic example incurs only\\napproximately 3% of the cost of a human-annotated demonstration, we demonstrate that synthetic\\ndata with good domain coverage can be more effective than an identical quantity of limited-domain\\nhuman demonstrations in real-world web-based tasks in WebArena (\\u00a76.2).\\n2\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"d7056732-f450-58dc-ac5f-9829b1393481\",\"title\":\"Synatra: Turning Indirect Knowledge into Direct Demonstrations for Digital Agents at Scale\",\"abstract\":\"LLMs can now act as autonomous agents that interact with digital environments and complete specific objectives (e.g., arranging an online meeting).

While this framework can\\nbe applied to different types of task, in this work, we consider a web browser as the unified entry point\\nto access different web applications. We follow WebArena [58] to define the observation space as the\\ncontents on screen, represented as in text-based accessibility tree format. We use the same universal\\naction space as in WebArena. This action space resembles the keyboard and mouse operations of a\\n2\\ncomputer (e.g., click, type), and is applicable to arbitrary web applications. Appendix A lists all\\nvalid actions. The environment dynamics (e.g., the effect of clicking a button) and the states (e.g., the\\ndatabase status) are decided by the implementation of each web application.\\nGiven the natural language intent i, at each time step t, an agent issues an action at \\u2208A based on\\nst. The environment state is updated to st+1 with new observation ot+1. This process ends when\\nthe agent predicts the stop action. We follow existing works [6, 47, 58, 54] to represent st with\\ncurrent observation and all previous actions in the form of (i, a1, ..., at\\u22121, ot). A benchmark (e.g.,\\nWebArena) supplies a scoring function r(i, sn) that examines the final state and returns 1 if the\\ndesired goal state is satisfied, and 0 otherwise.\\n2.2\\nDefinition of Direct Demonstrations and Indirect Knowledge\\nWe consider the expected action at given st as a form of direct demonstration, i.e., (st, at). This\\nallows an agent to directly learn how to predict the next action under a given state. On the other hand,\\nindirect knowledge is broadly defined as resources that can benefit the task execution, but is not in\\nthe format of state and expected action tuple. We mainly focus on three types of indirect knowledge:\\n1. Procedural knowledge details the sequence of steps \\u27e8a\\u2032\\n1, a\\u2032\\n2, ..., a\\u2032\\nn\\u27e9required to complete a specific\\ntask i. Unlike an action at in trajectories, the steps in procedural knowledge are ungrounded, they\\nlack a direct association with any particular observation and are not tied to specific action spaces.\\nFor instance, the tutorial in Figure 1 instructs the user to \\u201clogin with your credentials\\u201d without\\nproviding the concrete PayPal login page and the input fields to type.\\n2. Environment knowledge T that describe the effects of applying different actions in some hy-\\npothetical states. Example knowledge includes verbal descriptions such as \\u201c... after clicking the\\ncancel button, you will see a pop up window ...\\u201d.\\n3. Ungrounded observations o that are not associated with particular tasks or trajectories. In the\\ncontext of web-based tasks, an observation could be any random web page with different content\\nand status (e.g., a product page with a query in the search field).\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
