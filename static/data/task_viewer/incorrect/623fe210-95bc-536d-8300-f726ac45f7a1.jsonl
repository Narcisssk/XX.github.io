{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, RL often also suffers from the need for extensive interaction with\\nthe environment and missing compelling rewards in real-life applications [37].\\nTo address this, Imitation Learning (IL), where an agent learns from demonstrations, is gaining\\npopularity recently [20, 22, 27]. Offline imitation learning, such as behavior cloning (BC) [51],\\nallows the agent to learn from existing experience without environment interaction and reward label,\\nwhich is useful when wrong actions are costly. However, similar to RL, IL also suffers when limited\\ndata is available [52] \\u2013 which is common as demonstrations of the target task need to be collected\\nevery time a new task is addressed. In this work, we consider a special but widely studied [31, 36, 60]\\ncase of expert data shortage in offline IL, i.e., offline Learning from Observations (LfO) [71]. In\\nLfO the task-specific data only consists of a few expert trajectories, key frames, or even just the goal\\n(the latter is also known as example-based IL [13]), and the dynamics must be mostly learned from\\ntask-agnostic data, i.e., demonstration from data not necessarily directly related to the target task. For\\nexample, sometimes the agent must learn from experts with different embodiment [41], where expert\\nactions are not applicable.\\nIn the field of offline LfO, researchers have explored action pseudo-labeling [33, 60], inverse RL [31,\\n61, 73], and similarity-based reward labeling [8, 55]; for example-based IL, the benchmark is\\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\\n(a) Problem Settings\\n(b) Discriminator R(s)\\n(c) Weighted Behavior Cloning\\nFigure 1: An illustration of our method, TAILO. Different trajectories are illustrated by different styles of arrows.\\nTAILO consists of two parametric steps: 1) train a discriminator which gives high R(s) for near-expert states\\nand low R(s) for non-expert states, as shown in panel b); 2) conduct weighted behavior cloning with weights\\ncalculated from R(s) along the trajectory, as shown in panel c). High transparency indicates a small weight for\\nthe state and its corresponding action.\\nRCE [13], which uses RL with classifier-labeled reward. Recently, DIstribution Correction Estimation\\n(DICE) methods, LobsDICE [23] and SMODICE [41], achieve the state of the art for both offline LfO\\nand example-based IL. Both methods minimize the state visitation frequency (occupancy) divergence\\nbetween expert and learner policies, and conduct a convex optimization in the dual space.\\nHowever, DICE methods are neither robust to incomplete trajectories in the task-agnostic \\/ task-\\nspecific data [72], nor do they excel if the task-agnostic data contains a very small portion of expert\\ntrajectories or only segments [56]. These are inherent shortcomings of the DICE-based methods, as\\nthey are indirect: they first perform optimization in a dual domain (equivalent to finding the value\\nfunction in RL), and then recover the policy by weighted behavior cloning. Importantly, Kullback-\\nLeibler(KL)-based optimization of dual variables requires complete trajectories in the task-agnostic\\ndata to balance all terms in the objective. Note, SMODICE with \\u03c72-based optimization is also\\ntheoretically problematic (see Appendix C) and empirically struggles on testbeds [41].\\nTo overcome the shortcomings listed above, we propose a simple but effective method for imitation\\nlearning from observations and examples, Trajectory-Aware Imitation Learning from Observations\\n(TAILO). We leverage the common assumption that there exist trajectories or long segments that are\\nnear-optimal to the task of interest in the task-agnostic data. This assumption is the basis of skill-\\nbased learning [20, 46, 47], and the benchmarks of many recent works satiesfy this assumption [36,\\n40, 41, 56]; one real-life example fulfilling this assumption is robotics: the robot often utilizes\\noverlapping skills such as moving the robotic arm and grabbing items from other tasks to complete\\nthe current task. Based on this assumption, we discriminate\\/identify which state-action pairs could be\\ntaken by the expert, and assign large weights for trajectory segments leading to those segments in the\\ndownstream Weighted Behavior Cloning (WBC). This is a simple way to make the learned policy\\ntrajectory-aware. The method only consists of two parametric steps: 1) train a discriminator using\\npositive-unlabeled (PU) learning, and 2) use Weighted Behavior Cloning (WBC) on all state-action\\npairs in the task-agnostic data with the weights of WBC being a discounted sum over thresholded\\nscores given by the discriminator. Note, the discounted sum propagates large scores to trajectory\\nsegments in the past far from expert states, if they lead to expert trajectory segments eventually.\\nMeanwhile, as the task-agnostic data contains both expert and non-expert demonstrations, Positive-\\nUnlabeled (PU) learning is better than plain binary classification. Fig. 1 summarizes our algorithm.\\nWe found this simple solution to be surprisingly effective across multiple testbeds, especially if the\\ntask-agnostic data contains incomplete trajectories. In this latter case, baselines struggle or even\\ndiverge. Moreover, we find our method to also improve if the task-agnostic data contains only a small\\nportion of expert trajectories.\\nWe summarize our contributions as follows: 1) We carefully analyzed the state-of-the-art DICE\\nmethods in offline LfO, pointing out their limitations both empirically and theoretically (see Ap-\\npendix C for details); 2) We propose a simple yet effective solution to offline imitation learning from\\nobservations; and 3) We empirically show that this simple method is robust and works better than the\\nstate of the art on a variety of settings, including incomplete trajectories, few expert trajectories in the\\ntask-agnostic dataset, example-based IL and learning from mismatching dynamics.\\n2\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Preliminaries\",\"section_content\":\"Preliminaries\\nMarkov Decision Process. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a well-established framework for\\nsequential decision-making problems. An MDP is defined by the tuple (S, A, T, r, \\u03b3), where S is the\\nstate space and A is the action space. For every timestep t of the Markov process, a state st \\u2208S is\\ngiven, and an action at \\u2208A is chosen by the agent according to its policy \\u03c0(at|st) \\u2208\\u2206(A), where\\n\\u2206(A) is the probability simplex over A. Upon executing the action at, the MDP will transit to a\\nnew state st+1 \\u2208S according to the transition probability T(st+1|st, at) while the agent receives\\nreward r(st, at) \\u2208R. The goal of the agent is to maximize the discounted reward P\\nt \\u03b3tr(st, at)\\nwith discount factor \\u03b3 \\u2208[0, 1] over a complete run, which is called an episode. The state(-action\\npairs) collected through the run are called a state(-action) trajectory \\u03c4. Trajectory segment in this\\nwork is defined as a continuous subsequence of a trajectory \\u03c4. The state visitation frequency (state\\noccupancy) of a policy \\u03c0 is denoted as d\\u03c0(s) = (1 \\u2212\\u03b3) P\\nt \\u03b3t Pr(st = s). See Appendix A for a\\ndetailed definition of state occupancy and other occupancies.\\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning. Positive-Unlabeled learning [12] addresses the problem of binary\\nclassification with feature x \\u2208Rn and label y \\u2208{0, 1} when only the positive dataset DP and the\\nunlabeled dataset DU are known. Our solution leverages positive prior \\u03b7p = Pr(y = 1) and negative\\nprior \\u03b7n = Pr(y = 0), which are unknown and treated as a hyperparameter.\\nOffline Imitation from Observations \\/ Examples. Offline imitation learning from observations\\nrequires the agent to learn a good policy from two sources of data: one is the task-specific dataset\\nDTS, which contains state trajectories \\u03c4TS = {s1, s2, . . . , sn1} from the expert that directly addresses\\nthe task of interest; the other is the task-agnostic dataset DTA, which contains state-action trajectories\\n\\u03c4TA = {(s1, a1), (s2, a2), . . . , (sn2, an2)} of unknown optimality to the task of interest. Note that the\\ntask-specific trajectory \\u03c4TS can be incomplete; specifically, if only the last state exists as an example\\nof success, then it is called imitation from examples [13, 41].\\nThe state of the art methods in this field are SMODICE [41] and LobsDICE [23]. SMODICE\\nminimizes the divergence between the state occupancy from task-specific data dTS and the learner\\npolicy \\u03c0\\u2019s occupancy d\\u03c0; for example, when using a KL-divergence as the metric, the objective is\\nmin\\n\\u03c0 KL(d\\u03c0(s)\\u2225dTS(s)), s.t. \\u03c0 is a feasible policy.\\n(1)\\nHowever, since the task-agnostic dataset is the only source of correspondence between state and\\naction, the state occupancy of the task-agnostic dataset dTA must be introduced. With some derivations\\nand relaxations, the objective is rewritten as\\nmax\\n\\u03c0\\nEs\\u223cd\\u03c0 log dTS(s)\\ndTA(s) \\u2212KL(d\\u03c0(s)\\u2225dTA(s)), s.t. \\u03c0 is a feasible policy.\\n(2)\\nHere, the first term R(s) = log dTS(s)\\ndTA(s) is an indicator for the importance of the state; high R(s)\\nmeans that the expert often visits state s, and s is a desirable state. Such R(s) can be trained by a\\ndiscriminator c(s): a positive dataset DTS (label 1) and a negative dataset DTA (label 0) are used\\nto find an \\u2018optimal\\u2019 discriminator c = c\\u2217. Given this discriminator, we have R(s) = log\\nc\\u2217(s)\\n1\\u2212c\\u2217(s).\\nSMODICE then converts the constrained Eq. (2) to its unconstrained Lagrangian dual form with dual\\nvariable V (s), and optimizes the following objective (assuming KL-divergence as the metric):\\nmin\\nV (1 \\u2212\\u03b3)Es\\u223cp0[V (s)] + log E(s,a,s\\u2032)\\u223cDTA exp[R(s) + \\u03b3V (s\\u2032) \\u2212V (s)],\\n(3)\\nwhere \\u03b3 is the discount factor and p0 is the distribution of the initial state in the MDP. In this\\nformulation, R(s) can be regarded as the reward function, while V (s) is the value function. The\\nwhole objective is an optimization of a convex function with respect to the Bellman residual. With\\nV (s) learned, the policy is retrieved via weighted behavior cloning where the coefficient is determined\\nby V (s). LobsDICE is in spirit similar, but considers the occupancy of adjacent state pairs instead of\\na single state.\\n3\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Methodology\",\"section_content\":\"Methodology\\n3.1\\nMotivation and Overview\\nAs mentioned in Sec. 2, the DICE methods for offline LfO discussed above consist of three parts:\\nreward generation, optimization of the value function V (s), and weighted behavior cloning. Such\\na pipeline can be unstable for two reasons. First, the method is indirect, as the weight for behavior\\ncloning depends on the learned value function V (s), which could be inaccurate if the task-agnostic\\ndataset is noisy or is not very related to the task of interest. This is aggravated by the fact that V (s\\u2032)\\nas a 1-sample estimation of Es\\u2032\\u223cp(s\\u2032|s,a)V (s\\u2032) and logsumexp are used in the objective, which further\\ndestabilizes learning. Second, for KL-based metrics, if no state appears twice in the task-agnostic\\ndata, which is common for high-dimensional environments, the derivative of the objective with\\nrespect to V (s) is determined by the initial state term, the current state term \\u2212V (s), and the next state\\nterm \\u03b3V (s\\u2032). Thus, if a non-initial state s\\u2032 is missing from the trajectory, then only \\u2212\\u03b3V (s\\u2032) remains,\\nwhich makes the objective monotonic with respect to the unconstrained V (s\\u2032). Consequently, V\\ndiverges for s\\u2032 (see Appendix C in the for a more detailed analysis and visualization in Fig. 7).\\nTo address the stability issue, we develop Trajectory-Aware Imitation Learning from Observations\\n(TAILO). TAILO also seeks to find an approximate reward R(s) by leveraging the discriminator\\nc(s), which is empirically a good metric for optimality of the state. However, compared to DICE\\nmethods which determine the weight of behavior cloning via a dual program, we adopt a much\\nsimpler idea: find \\u2018good\\u2019 trajectory segments using the discounted sum of future R(s) along the\\ntrajectory following state s, and encourage the agent to follow them in the downstream weighted\\nBC. To do so, we assign a much larger weight, a thresholding result of the discounted sum, to the\\nstate-action pairs for \\u2018good\\u2019 segments. Meanwhile, small weights on other segments serve as a\\nregularizer of pessimism [25]. Such a method is robust to missing steps in the trajectory. Empiricially\\nwe find that the weight need not be very accurate for TAILO to succeed. In the remainder of the\\nsection, we discuss the two steps of TAILO: 1) training a discriminator to obtain R(s) (Sec. 3.2), and\\n2) thresholding over discounted sums of R(s) along the trajectory (Sec. 3.3).\\n3.2\\nPositive-Unlabeled Discriminator\\nFollowing DICE, R(s) is used as a metric for state optimality, and is obtained by training a discrimi-\\nnator c(s). However, different from DICE which regards all unlabeled data as negative samples, we\\nuse Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning to train c(s), since there often are some expert trajectories or\\nsegments of useful trajectories in the task-agnostic dataset. Consequently, we treat the task-agnostic\\ndataset as an unlabeled dataset with both positive samples (expert of the task of interest) and varied\\nnegative samples (non-expert).\\nOur training of c(s) consists of two steps: 1) training another discriminator c\\u2032(s) that identifies safe\\nnegative samples, and 2) formal training of c(s). In the first step, to alleviate the issue of treating\\npositive samples from DTA as negatives, we use a debiasing objective [29] for the training of c\\u2032(s)\\n(see Appendix A for a detailed derivation):\\nmin\\nc\\u2032(s) L1(c\\u2032) = min\\nc\\u2032(s) \\u2212[\\u03b7pEs\\u223cDTS log c\\u2032(s)+max(0, Es\\u223cDTA log(1\\u2212c\\u2032(s))\\u2212\\u03b7pEs\\u223cDTS log(1\\u2212c\\u2032(s)))], (4)\\nwhere the bias comes from viewing unlabeled samples as negative samples. Here, positive class prior\\n\\u03b7p is a hyperparameter; in experiments, we find results to not be sensitive to this hyperparameter.\\nIn the second step, after c\\u2032(s) is trained, R\\u2032(s) = log\\nc\\u2032(s)\\n1\\u2212c\\u2032(s) is calculated for each state in the\\ntask-agnostic data, and the states in the (possibly incomplete) trajectories with the least \\u03b21 \\u2208(0, 1)\\nportion of average R\\u2032(s) are identified as \\u201csafe\\u201d negative samples. Note, we do not identify \\u201csafe\\u201d\\npositive samples, because a trajectory that only has a segment useful for the task of interest might\\nnot have the highest average R\\u2032(s) due to its irrelevant part; however, an irrelevant trajectory will\\nprobably have the lowest R\\u2032(s) throughout the whole trajectory, and thus can be identified as a \\u201csafe\\u201d\\nnegative sample. We collect such samples to form a new dataset Dsafe TA.\\nFinally, the formal training of c(s) uses states from DTS as positive samples and Dsafe TA as \\u201csafe\\u201d\\nnegative samples. The training objective of c(s) is a combination of debiasing objective and standard\\ncross entropy loss for binary classification, controlled by hyperparameter \\u03b22. Specifically, we use\\n4\\nmin\\nc(s) \\u03b22L2(c) + (1 \\u2212\\u03b22)L3(c), where\\nL2(c) = min\\nc(s) \\u2212[\\u03b7pEs\\u223cDTS log c(s) + max(0, Es\\u223cDsafe TA log(1 \\u2212c(s)) \\u2212\\u03b7pEs\\u223cDTS log(1 \\u2212c(s)))],\\nL3(c) = Es\\u223cDTS log c(s) + Es\\u223cDsafe TA log(1 \\u2212c(s)).\\n(5)\\nIn this work, we only consider \\u03b22 \\u2208{0, 1}; empirically, we found that \\u03b22 = 0 is better if the agent\\u2019s\\nembodiments across DTS and DTA are the same, and \\u03b22 = 1 is better if the embodiments differ. This\\nis because a debiasing objective assumes positive samples still exist in the safe negatives, which\\npushes the classification margin further from samples in DTS, and has a larger probability to classify\\nexpert segments in DTA as positive.\\n3.3\\nTrajectory-Aware Thresholding\\nWith the discriminator c(s) trained and R(s) = log\\nc(s)\\n1\\u2212c(s) obtained, we can identify the most useful\\ntrajectory segments for our task. To do this, we use a simple thresholding which makes the weight\\nemployed in behavior cloning trajectory-aware. Formally, the weight W(si, ai) for weighted behavior\\ncloning is calculated as\\nW(si, ai) =\\n\\u221e\\nX\\nj=0\\n\\u03b3j exp(\\u03b1R(si+j)),\\n(6)\\nwhere (si, ai) is the i-th step in a trajectory, and \\u03b1 is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of\\nthresholding; \\u03b1 balances the tradeoff between excluding non-expert and including expert-trajectories.\\nFor an i + j which exceeds the length of the trajectory, we set si+j to be the last state of the (possibly\\nincomplete) known trajectory, as the final state is of significant importance in many applications [18].\\nThis design also allows us to conveniently address the example-based offline IL problem, where the\\nfinal state is important. With the weights determined, we finally conduct a weighted behavior cloning\\nwith the objective max\\u03c0 E(s,a)\\u223cDTAW(s, a) log \\u03c0(a|s), where \\u03c0(a|s) is the desired policy.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
