{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"We evaluate our approach\\u2019s performance of mitigating stereotypical bias in a GPT-2 small model on multiple benchmarks and compare its performance to various existing debiasing methods.\\nBenchmark methods Benchmark methods we consider fall into the following categories depending on which stages they are applied to:\\n\\u2022 Pre-training: CDA (Zhao et al., 2019; Zmigrod et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020) is a commonly used data augmentation method that augments the original biased dataset with synthetic gender-swapped sentences for fairer model pre-training. Dropout dissociates attributes and targets by increasing dropout rate in model pre-training (Webster et al., 2020).\\n\\u2022 Fine-tuning: Here we extend the concept of fne-tuning to include both full fne-tuning and parameter-effcient fne-tuning. ContextDebias (Kaneko and Bollegala, 2021) is a projection-based full fne-tuning method that encourages models to encode attribute and target words orthogonally to each other. Controllable-Bias (Sheng et al., 2020) mitigates bias by learning a discrete prompt that reduces negative regards for both genders.\\n\\u2022 Post-hoc: Iterative null-space projection (INLP) (Ravfogel et al., 2020) trains a set of linear classifers to predict genders from embeddings and then projects embeddings to the null-space of learned classifers. Self-Debias (Schick et al., 2021) adjusts next token probabilities at each step according to model\\u2019s prediction to what extent the next token is biased.\\nAs baselines, we also report the performance of vanilla GPT-2 and GPT-2 with randomly initialized prefx.\\nDataset In our experiment, we collected sentences with at least one attribute and one target word from the News-Commentary V15 dataset and obtained our training data of 13995 sentence pair after counterfactual data augmentation. As for benchmark methods, we follow settings from Meade et al. (2022) that pre-training methods (CDA and Dropout) use Wikipedia-10 dump for continued pre-training and INLP uses Wikipedia-2.5 dump to learn linear classifers.\\n\\nBias Word List We use the same target word list as in Zhao et al. (2018b) and combine word lists in Kaneko and Bollegala (2019) and the SemBias dataset Zhao et al. (2018b) as attribute word list. In the end, we have a target word list $C$ of 222 pairs and an attribute word list $W$ of 209 words. The two lists are provided in Appendix A. For a fair comparison, CDA, INLP and Context-Debias are also trained using the same bias word lists.\\nEvaluation Metrics We adopt various different metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of our approach and benchmark methods.\\n\\u2022 CrowS-Pairs: CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) consists of pairs of minimally distant sentences, with one sentence expressing stereotype while the other being antistereotypical. Stereotypical bias of a model is evaluated as the frequency that it assigns higher probability to stereotypical sentences than anti-stereotypical ones. Ideally, a fullydebiased model should have a score of 50.\\n\\u2022 StereoSet: Each example in StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) contains a context and three options: stereotype, anti-stereotype and unrelated. Stereotype score (SS) is computed similarly to CrowS-Pairs as how often model prefers stereotypical options. Besides, language modeling score (LMS) measures how often related options (stereotype or anti-stereotype) rank higher than unrelated options. Finally, idealized context association test (ICAT) score combines SS and LMS. Higher ICAT indicates a better balance between bias reduction and language modeling ability preservation. In our experiment we use both intra- and intersentence subsets of StereoSet, which are fll-in-the blank and next sentence prediction tasks respectively.\\n\\u2022 Perplexity: In addition to LMS in StereoSet, we also measure models\\u2019 perplexity on $10\\\\%$ of WikiText-2 dataset to refect their language modeling ability. Lower perplexity indicates the language ability of pre-trained models is better maintained after debiasing.\\n\\n\\u2022 Regard: As the principal application of generative LMs is to produce natural language texts, we also study bias in generation by comparing regard polarity distributions of samples generated by models. We generate 50 samples based on every one of the ten context templates from Sheng et al.\\u2019s (2020) work for each gender. Then the regard of all 1000 samples is predicted by a pre-trained classifer to determine whether the distributions for male and female samples are different. To quantitatively measure the effects of debiasing techniques, we compute regard difference and regard shift as the absolute difference between male and female distributions and between a debiased model and vanilla GPT-2 distributions. Higher regard difference implies bias and higher regard shift means a debiasing technique disturbs inherent distribution of pretrained LMs. We provide all context templates we use in Appendix B.\\nFor CrowS-Pairs, perplexity and intrasentence task of StereoSet, we adopt the implementation from Meade et al. $(2022)^{2}$ . We implement intersentence task by ourselves. The pre-trained classifer used in regard experiments is from Sheng et al. $(2020)^{3}$ .\\nExperiment Setting Following the work of Li and Liang (2021), we train a prefx of length 10 with prefx projection dimension of 800. As GPT-2 works on sub-word level, we only use target pairs and attribute words that can be represented as a single token when computing neutralization and token level equalizing losses. Based on our observations, the counts of stereotypically masculine and feminine words remain roughly equivalent after the fltering process. For convenient selection of hyperparameters, the coeffcient $\\\\alpha_{1}$ for language modeling loss is fxed to be 1, and we fnd the combination of $\\\\alpha_{2}=50$ , $\\\\alpha_{3}=200$ , $\\\\alpha_{4}=250$ results in the highest ICAT score on StereoSet validation set after 5 epochs of training. For a fair comparison, CDA, Dropout and Context-Debias checkpoints are also selected according to StereoSet validation set. Further information about experimental details can be found in Appendix C.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Results of automatic evaluation are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. For each metric, we mark the best and equivalently good results (i.e., no statistically signifcant difference from the best score) in bold. Signifcant improvements over vanilla model are also marked in the tables.4\\nStereoSet In StereoSet, our method achieves consistently strong performance across different settings (see Table 1): our model shows the lowest degree of bias in the intrasentence task and remains competitive in the intersentence task. It also preserves satisfactory language modeling ability, falling only slightly behind pre-training methods in LMS. As a result, our approach demonstrates the best balance between bias reduction and language ability preservation with signifcantly higher ICAT scores than vanilla GPT-2 in both tasks, and it exceeds most benchmark methods by a remarkable margin. In comparison, post-hoc approaches (INLP and Self-Debias) generally lead to fairer predictions, yet dramatically hurt model\\u2019s language ability. Pre-training and projection-based fne-tuning methods (CDA, Dropout and Context-Debias), on the other hand, obtain decent LMS, whereas they do not guarantee to effectively remove bias. This marks the importance of utilizing more informative and explicit fairness objectives in bias mitigation. Controllable-Bias shows unstable results in two tasks, likely because its training objectives are not directly related to demographic parity.\\nCrowS-Pairs In Table 2, similar results can be seen on CrowS-Pairs. Post-hoc methods effectively remove bias from vanilla GPT-2. In contrast, CDA and Dropout demonstrate trivial or negative debiasing effects. The observation that Context-Debias achieves lower degree of bias on CrowS-Pairs but not on StereoSet indicates projection-based methods do not generalize to different forms of bias when evaluated on diverse benchmarks. Our model again sees the best debiasing performance, followed by Controllable-Bias. Both methods have produced close-to-zero bias in this metric.\\nPerplexity All debiasing techniques lead to signifcantly worse perplexity than vanilla GPT-2. Self-Debias and Controllable-Bias obtain the lowest perplexity among all debiased models, despite the fact that neither method involves modeling human language as optimization objective. Pretraining methods and Context-Debias remain competitive. INLP and our method perform the worst, followed by adding random prefxes. This can be partly explained by discrepancy in domains of training and evaluation data: our debiased model is trained to minimize $L_{L M}$ in news domain, which is different from Wikipedia used for perplexity measurement. Besides, incorporating multiple debiasing losses could impose additional constraints on model training, thereby impairing the language ability. To determine whether the PPL loss is due to domain discrepancy or worse language ability induced by our method, we use human evaluation for a more accurate assessment of the language ability of debiased LMs.\\nRegard As regard refects the language polarity towards and social perceptions of a demo\\nTable 2: Results on CrowS-Pairs benchmark, perplexity and regard distribution. Stereotype scores (SS) closer to 50 indicate better debiasing performance. Lower perplexity, regard difference and shift represent better language modeling ability, less bias and fewer changes compared to original models. The best and equivalently good scores are marked in bold. \\\\* indicates a signifcant improvement over GPT-2 model in SS and regard difference $({\\\\mathsf{p}}{<}0.05)$ .\\ngraphic group, we see a low regard difference as better stereotype reduction in generation. According to results calculated from 1000 examples, our model achieves the lowest regard difference score of merely 0.052. Controllable-Bias, which is trained to align regard polarity using the same set of context templates, also performs strongly in this metric. Both systems signifcantly reduce the regard difference compared to default generation. Dropout shows only minor improvement, while CDA, Context-Debias and Self-Debias lead to more bias. We also report regard shift i.e., how much the regard distributions of debiased models are different from that of vanilla GPT-2. Our system is by far the worst in regard shift. By manual inspection, we assume this to be another result of overftting to the training data from news domain: our model frequently generates politics and science related content which are preferred by the regard classifer. Consequently, our model is dramatically more likely to produce sentences with positive regard than the vanilla model.

In particular, pre-trained generative LMs,\\ne.g., GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-3 (Brown\\net al., 2020), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) and GPT-4\\n(OpenAI, 2023), have gained great attention from\\nboth academic communities and non-expert users,\\ndue to their remarkable instruction-following and\\nzero-shot task adaptation abilities (Brown et al.,\\n2020; OpenAI, 2023; Wei et al., 2022).\\nDespite their remarkable achievements and great\\npractical values, potential ethical risks cannot be\\nneglected. Since these pre-trained LMs are mostly\\ntrained on online datasets, their training data is\\nlikely to contain undesired patterns including toxic\\nspeech and social biases (Zhao et al., 2019; Tan and\\nCelis, 2019). Numerous experiments have revealed\\nthat LMs trained in these datasets also demonstrate\\nsimilar social biases, raising concerns that they\\ncould amplify biases and discrimination against dis-\\nadvantaged demographics (Zhao et al., 2019; May\\net al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019; Bommasani et al.,\\n2020; Guo and Caliskan, 2021; Kurita et al., 2019;\\nBrown et al., 2020; Sheng et al., 2019; Yeo and\\nChen, 2020). Recently, several methods for reduc-\\ning stereotypical biases have been proposed (Barik-\\neri et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2020; Kaneko\\nand Bollegala, 2021). However, most methods ne-\\nglect the fact that bias can be represented in various\\nforms in LMs. For example, LMs can violate equal\\nsocial group associations by predicting different oc-\\ncupations for male and female genders, or violate\\nequal neutral neutral associations by believing that\\ncriminals are more likely to be people of color (Gal-\\nlegos et al., 2023). In addition, biased LMs gen-\\nerate sentences containing higher-level disparity,\\nsuch as sentiment (Huang et al., 2020) and regard\\n(Sheng et al., 2019) for different demographics,\\ndemonstrating global bias (Liang et al., 2021). As\\na result, methods targeting only one specific form\\nof bias can lead to incomplete bias removal and\\nunsatisfactory debiasing performance.\\nBesides, the increasing scale of pre-trained LMs\\nboosts the design and application of parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning methods (Houlsby et al., 2019;\\nLester et al., 2021; Li and Liang, 2021; Hu et al.,\\n2022). Unfortunately, relatively little work has\\nbeen devoted to studying parameter-efficient meth-\\nods in the field of bias mitigation (Lauscher et al.,\\n2021; Gira et al., 2022; Xie and Lukasiewicz,\\n2023). In this work, we also aim to further explore\\nlightweight debiasing techniques using parameter-\\n1\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"efficient fine-tuning methods.\\nThe main contribution of this work includes:\\n1. We refine and integrate existing probabilistic\\nalignment debiasing approaches to simulta-\\nneously address multiple forms of bias rep-\\nresentation, employing a parameter-efficient\\nprefix-tuning technique for implementation.\\n2. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness\\nof our method on diverse intrinsic and extrin-\\nsic bias evaluation benchmarks and compared\\nit with existing debiasing techniques.\\n3. We thoroughly analyze our parameter-efficient\\ndebiasing framework and show that it can\\nachieve better bias mitigation performance\\nand parameter efficiency than full fine-tuning.\\nAdditionally, our method is effective in reduc-\\ning bias in large LMs.\\n2\\nBias Statement\\nIn this work, we mainly address stereotypical bias,\\nwith binary gender bias as an example1. We de-\\nfine stereotypical bias as an overgeneralized belief\\nabout a particular group of people that can hurt\\ntarget groups (Nadeem et al., 2021). \\\"Women are\\nbad drivers\\\" and \\\"Asians are good at math\\\", for\\ninstance, are gender and racial stereotypical biases.\\nGenerative LMs can also contain such bias. For\\nexample, \\\"doctor\\\" can receive a higher probability\\nwhen conditioned on \\\"he worked as a [BLANK]\\\"\\nthan \\\"she worked as a [BLANK]\\\" (Liang et al.,\\n2021). Unlike discrimination, stereotypical bias is\\nmore implicit and thus can cause both representa-\\ntional and allocational harms (Blodgett et al., 2020)\\nto target groups without them being aware of it. As\\nis commonly seen in our society, boys and girls\\nare encouraged to engage in different activities and\\nexpected to possess different characteristics during\\ntheir childhood, and those gender-related expecta-\\ntions might affect their future academic success and\\ncareer choices (Olsson and Martiny, 2018). Since\\npeople are increasingly turning to LLMs for advice\\ngiving or decision making, reducing stereotypical\\nbias in LLMs is of practical relevance.\\n3\\nRelated Work\\nBias in NLP systems\\nStereotypical bias can man-\\nifest itself in different forms in LMs (Gallegos et al.,\\n1We recognize that gender is non-binary and in Section 4.2\\nwe formulate our training objective in a way that can handle\\nnon-binary gender bias as well.\\n2023). Geometric relationships in model represen-\\ntations, for example, can encode stereotypical asso-\\nciations between genders and occupations (Boluk-\\nbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Zhao et al.,\\n2019; May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019; Bom-\\nmasani et al., 2020). Bias is also indicated by vari-\\nous divergence of probabilities from LMs. Kurita\\net al. (2019) and Brown et al. (2020) observed dif-\\nferent probabilities predicted by both masked LMs\\nand generative LMs for male and female genders\\ngiven stereotypical attributes; Liang et al. (2021)\\nidentified local bias as different next token probabil-\\nity distributions conditioned on same contexts with\\nonly social group swapped; Barikeri et al. (2021)\\nadditionally considered difference in probabilities\\nassigned to whole sentence pairs which are mini-\\nmally different in social groups, which corresponds\\nto global bias defined in Liang et al. (2021). Bias\\ncan also be observed as disparity in model genera-\\ntion (Sheng et al., 2019; Yeo and Chen, 2020) and\\nperformance in downstream tasks, such as toxicity\\ndetection (Sap et al., 2022) and coreference resolu-\\ntion (Kurita et al., 2019). In this work, we mainly\\nmitigate bias reflected by divergent probability dis-\\ntributions predicted by LMs.\\nMitigating bias in pre-trained LMs\\nWhile\\nmany studies aimed to train fair LMs from scratch\\nby constructing fairer datasets (Zhao et al., 2019;\\nZmigrod et al., 2019), it can be computationally ex-\\npensive and not always feasible in practice. As\\na result, much effort has been put into mitigat-\\ning bias from pre-trained LMs via debiasing fine-\\ntuning. Kaneko and Bollegala (2021) extended\\nprojection-based methods from static word em-\\nbeddings (Bolukbasi et al., 2016) and fine-tuned\\nmodels to output orthogonal contextualized repre-\\nsentations for gendered and stereotypical words.\\nHowever, Gonen and Goldberg (2019) argued that\\nprojection-based methods did not completely cap-\\nture and remove bias. Other experiments involved\\nintroducing fairness regularization operating on\\nprobability level. Qian et al. (2019) and Garimella\\net al. (2021) proposed equalizing losses to assign\\nsimilar probabilities to male and female words, and\\nGuo et al. (2022) aligned the distributions of neu-\\ntral words given the same prompts with different\\ndemographic groups. However, as bias can have\\ndifferent notions and forms in LMs (Kaneko and\\nBollegala, 2019; Gallegos et al., 2023), failure of\\nexisting studies to address multiple forms of bias\\ncan lead to suboptimal debiasing results, especially\\n2\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"Figure 1: An overview of our proposed method.

Recently, Xie and Lukasiewicz (2023) em-\\npirically evaluated various parameter-efficient de-\\nbiasing methods and showed promising results. In\\nthis work, we focus on prefix-tuning (Li and Liang,\\n2021) to demonstrate the efficacy of parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning for multi-objective debiasing,\\nas it avoids the inference overhead and complex\\nhyperparameter selection present in adapter tuning\\nand LoRA.\\n4\\nDebiasing LMs by Multi-Objective\\nProbability Alignment\\nIn this section, we present our method which si-\\nmultaneously mitigates different forms of gen-\\nder bias in LMs via probability alignment.

An\\noverview of our pipeline is shown in Figure 1.\\n4.1\\nTask Formulation\\nFollowing previous work (Caliskan et al., 2017;\\nGuo et al., 2022), we first define the target and\\nattribute words: Target words are paired words re-\\nlated to demographic groups that can define a bias\\ndirection (e.g., female-male, she-he), and attribute\\nwords are gender-neutral words yet containing\\nstereotypical associations with certain target groups\\n3\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"(e.g., \\u201cprogrammer\\u201d, \\u201ctechnology\\u201d). In the follow-\\ning parts of the work, we use a set of m-tuples C =\\n{(c(1)\\n1 , c(2)\\n1 , ..., c(m)\\n1\\n), (c(1)\\n2 , c(2)\\n2 , ..., c(m)\\n2\\n), ...}\\nto\\ndenote target words and W\\n=\\n{w1, w2, ...}\\nto denote attribute words.\\nA set of sentences\\ncontaining at least one target word in C and\\none attribute word in W can then be collected\\nfrom natural language datasets.\\nAfter apply-\\ning counterfactual data augmentation (Zhao\\net al., 2019; Zmigrod et al., 2019) by replacing\\ntarget words with their opposite gender counter-\\nparts, we can obtain our training dataset S =\\n{(s(1)\\n1 , s(2)\\n1 , ..., s(m)\\n1\\n), (s(1)\\n2 , s(2)\\n2 , ..., s(m)\\n2\\n), ...}. As\\nwe address binary gender bias in this work, m = 2\\nand C and S are sets of two-tuples.\\nWe omit\\nsubscripts of C and S when there is no ambiguity.\\nIn this work, we mainly explore debiasing gen-\\nerative LMs using prefix-tuning, that is, learning\\na task-specific continuous prompt to steer model\\ngeneration without varying pre-trained parameters.\\nAssume that we have a pre-trained decoder-only\\nmodel parameterized by \\u03d5. In prefix-tuning, we\\nintroduce a small set of trainable parameters P\\u03b8\\nthat we call the \\\"prefix\\\". They are essential a set of\\nkey and value pairs of each token in an imaginary\\ncontinuous prompt, which can affect generation\\nwhen following tokens attend to it. During train-\\ning, \\u03d5 is frozen and only P\\u03b8 is optimized against\\ndesigned objectives. For further details please re-\\nfer to Li and Liang (2021). We also adopt the\\nre-parameterization method in their work for stable\\ntraining.\\nWith these concepts defined, the task can be\\nformulated as: given attribute words W, target\\nwords C, dataset S and a pre-trained generative\\nmodel LM\\u03d5, train a prefix P\\u03b8 that mitigates differ-\\nent forms of stereotypical gender bias in the model.\\n4.2\\nDebiasing Objectives\\nAfter collecting training data S, we can then debias\\nLM\\u03d5 by learning P\\u03b8. In our proposed method, we\\nintroduce multiple fairness objectives, correspond-\\ning to different types of bias we aim to reduce.\\nSpecifically, P\\u03b8 is learned by minimizing the fol-\\nlowing debiasing losses:\\nLanguage Modeling Loss\\nAs previous work\\npointed out, bias in pre-trained models can be at-\\ntributed to the selection and amplification biases\\nin imbalanced training data (Zhao et al., 2019; Tan\\nand Celis, 2019; Shah et al., 2020), thus tuning\\nthe model on counterfactually augmented data can\\nmitigate stereotypical associations and reduce bias\\n(Zhao et al., 2019; Zmigrod et al., 2019). Here we\\noptimize the prefix matrix to minimize language\\nmodeling loss (LLM), which is the negative log-\\nlikelihood (NLL) loss on S:\\nLLM = \\u22121\\n|X|log(P\\u03d5(X|P\\u03b8))\\n= \\u22121\\n|X|\\n|X|\\nX\\ni\\nlog(P\\u03d5(Xi|X<i; P\\u03b8))\\nNeutralization Loss\\nTo further dissociate tar-\\nget and attribute concepts, we then introduce neu-\\ntralization loss (Lneu) to inform models where to\\nfind the bias. Neutralization loss is intended to\\nachieve equal social group association that a neu-\\ntral word should be equally likely given its con-\\ntext regardless of social groups (Gallegos et al.,\\n2023). We borrow the approach from Auto-Debias\\n(Guo et al., 2022) to penalize Jenson-Shannon di-\\nvergence (JSD) between predicted next token dis-\\ntributions conditioned on paired contexts:\\nLneu = JSD(p1, p2)\\n= 1\\n2\\nX\\ni\\u2208{1,2}\\nKLD(pi||p1 + p2\\n2\\n)\\nwhere p1 and p2 are normalized probability distri-\\nbutions over W given original and counterfactu-\\nally augmented contexts in S. Unlike Auto-Debias\\nwhich minimized JSD on non-sensible prompts,\\nwe apply neutralization loss to natural language\\nsentences, believing this can better maintain the\\nlanguage ability of models.\\nEqualizing Loss\\nAnother type of fairness we aim\\nto achieve is equal neutral association, namely tar-\\nget words in the same tuple should be equally likely\\nin a neutral context. Qian et al. (2019) proposed\\nto penalize the predicted probability difference by\\nLeq =\\n1\\n|C|\\nP|C|\\ni\\n|log p(c(1)\\ni\\n)\\np(c(2)\\ni\\n)|. However, it can be\\neasily observed that this loss is too coarse-grained\\nin that it should not penalize positions where gen-\\ndered information is present in the context. For\\nexample, in the sentence \\u201cThe little girl is actually\\na famous [actress\\/actor].\\u201d, equalizing the probabil-\\nities of \\u201cactress\\u201d and \\u201cactor\\u201d hurts the language\\nmodeling capacity. Therefore, some modifications\\nare made to the equalizing loss in our approach:\\nFirstly, we introduce a simple yet effective\\nvocabulary-based data selection process: we only\\n4\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
