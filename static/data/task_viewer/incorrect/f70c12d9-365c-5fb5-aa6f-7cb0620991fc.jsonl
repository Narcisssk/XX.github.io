{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development. Top usage scenarios include checking calendar, playing music, and asking about time, etc. We utilized the $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{hr}$ test set for evaluation.\\nEthical Considerations: We have reviewed all licenses of public datasets, which allow the usage for research and paper publication. The in-house dataset ConvAI is internally approved for research purposes. All datasets are sets are de-identifed to ensure anonymity. We also make sure the datasets cover various English accents, speakers and backgrounds.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We validate our methods on 10 datasets over 4 tasks, including quadruplet tasks, ASQP and ACOS, and triplet tasks, ASTE and TASD.

The dataset consists of original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts. We show examples in Table 1.\\nAlthough it is crucial to choose texts that cover as many periods as possible since vocabulary and grammar change with time, it is diffcult to construct a comprehensive dataset. To our knowledge, Tangshixuan8 (Selection of Tang Poems) is the largest resource containing both original ancient Chinese texts and translated Kanbun texts. We use this resource to make our dataset. For preprocessing, we extract the Japanese reading order from Kanbun by a rule-based program. For the special tokens that may not appear in Kanbun or appear multiple times, we annotated them manually. We also convert the characters from old character forms to new character forms (kind of like transforming Traditional Chinese to Simplifed Chinese, but in Japanese character forms) using dictionaries to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem.\\nTangshixuan contains a total of 465 poems. We split the dataset using group shuffe split to ensure that all sentences in one poem would not be split. Table 2 lists the statistics of the dataset.\\nBased on the dataset, we introduce two tasks, character reordering and machine translation, both of which are signifcant in Kanbun comprehension. For character reordering, the goal is to transform Classical Chinese texts into Japanese reading orders, from SVO to SOV. Japanese reading orders as\\nTable 1: Examples of our dataset. Each instance has a triple of the original ancient Chinese text, the Japanese reading order (the numbers represent their index in the original text), and the translated Kanbun text.\\nshown in Table 1, such as \\u201c12543\\u201d, are the targets to be predicted. Machine translation is a sequenceto-sequence task that translates Classical Chinese texts into Kanbun. Since the source and target sentences share the vocabulary, it can also be considered as a multilingual rewriting task.\\nWe split each sentence into characters and preprocess them into inputs by the form {character}{the character\\u2019s index in the sentence}[SEP]{sentence}. The character\\u2019s index is added to handle the cases where more than two identical characters appear in one sentence. To make gold labels for training, we normalize the ranks by the lengths of the sentences, making the value of ranks range from 0 to 1 (for a sentence of length 5, the ranks will be normalized from 1, 2, ..., 5 to 0.2, 0.4, ..., 1). Once we collect the output ranks, we sort them in ascending order and restore them to the original characters. Then we obtain a reordered sentence. An illustration of our sorting method is shown in (A) of Figure 2.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Details of Dataset\\nTo train the visual text generation model, we constructed a dataset called TG-2M, which contains rich\\ntextual data.

This process is necessary because some captions generated\\nby BLIP-2 are meaningless, as shown in Fig. 10. Additionally, although Qwen-VL\\u2019s captions are of\\nhigh quality, many of them are quite lengthy, which can affect the understanding of the CLIP text\\nencoder in the diffusion model.\\nBLIP-2 Caption: carouselell - carouselell - carouselell - carouselell - carouselell -\\ncarouselell - carouselell - carouselell \\u2013\\nQwen-VL Caption: An animated welcome message displayed by the website carousell.com. \\nIt features several icons arranged around a central circle which contains the text \\u201cCarousell\\u201d.\\nBLIP-2 Caption: car cover for car, car cover for car, car cover for car, car cover for car, car \\ncover for car.\\nQwen-VL Caption: Free shipping!

To construct the dataset, we replace each letter in the LibriSpeech transcript with an image of that letter\\u2019s ASL Alphabet symbol chosen uniformly at random from Unvoiced. To study the effect of visual variability on SSR-U, we subset the ASL Alphabet images to 100, 300, 500, or 1000 images per letter sign. The dev-clean subset of LibriSpeech is used as the validation set.\\nFingerspelling LJSpeech We train our characterlevel model on another sentence-level fngerspelling dataset constructed from LJSpeech (Ito and Johnson, 2017) and the ASL Alphabet dataset similar to the fngerspelling LibriSpeech.\\nASL LibriSpeech For the word-level SSR-U, we construct another corpus using LibriSpeech for speech and MSASL (Joze and Koller, 2019) for word-level sign videos. Since many MSASL videos no longer exist on YouTube, only $11.6\\\\mathbf{k}$ out of $25\\\\mathrm{k}$ videos are downloaded. Further, due to the mismatch in vocabulary size, we use forced alignment information to flter out LibriSpeech words that don\\u2019t appear in MSASL and keep sentences that are at least 5 words long. Next, for each word in each sentence, we pick a word-level sign video uniformly at random from MSASL. To study the effect of vocabulary size on our model, we follow the split provided by (Joze and Koller, 2019) to subset the data to a vocabulary size of 100, 200, 500 or 1000.\"}\n\n... # only display 8 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development. Top usage scenarios include checking calendar, playing music, and asking about time, etc. We utilized the $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{hr}$ test set for evaluation.\\nEthical Considerations: We have reviewed all licenses of public datasets, which allow the usage for research and paper publication. The in-house dataset ConvAI is internally approved for research purposes. All datasets are sets are de-identifed to ensure anonymity. We also make sure the datasets cover various English accents, speakers and backgrounds.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We validate our methods on 10 datasets over 4 tasks, including quadruplet tasks, ASQP and ACOS, and triplet tasks, ASTE and TASD. For a fair comparison, we apply the same data splits as previous works.

(2021a) subsequently. For the ACOS task, we apply Restaurant-ACOS and Laptop-ACOS constructed by Cai et al. (2021). Compared with ASQP, datasets of ACOS focus on implicit aspects and opinions, which helps to measure our methods comprehensively. For the triple tasks, we adopt datasets provided by Xu et al.

The dataset consists of original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts. We show examples in Table 1.\\nAlthough it is crucial to choose texts that cover as many periods as possible since vocabulary and grammar change with time, it is diffcult to construct a comprehensive dataset. To our knowledge, Tangshixuan8 (Selection of Tang Poems) is the largest resource containing both original ancient Chinese texts and translated Kanbun texts. We use this resource to make our dataset. For preprocessing, we extract the Japanese reading order from Kanbun by a rule-based program. For the special tokens that may not appear in Kanbun or appear multiple times, we annotated them manually. We also convert the characters from old character forms to new character forms (kind of like transforming Traditional Chinese to Simplifed Chinese, but in Japanese character forms) using dictionaries to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem.\\nTangshixuan contains a total of 465 poems. We split the dataset using group shuffe split to ensure that all sentences in one poem would not be split. Table 2 lists the statistics of the dataset.\\nBased on the dataset, we introduce two tasks, character reordering and machine translation, both of which are signifcant in Kanbun comprehension. For character reordering, the goal is to transform Classical Chinese texts into Japanese reading orders, from SVO to SOV. Japanese reading orders as\\nTable 1: Examples of our dataset.

Machine translation is a sequenceto-sequence task that translates Classical Chinese texts into Kanbun. Since the source and target sentences share the vocabulary, it can also be considered as a multilingual rewriting task.\\nWe split each sentence into characters and preprocess them into inputs by the form {character}{the character\\u2019s index in the sentence}[SEP]{sentence}. The character\\u2019s index is added to handle the cases where more than two identical characters appear in one sentence. To make gold labels for training, we normalize the ranks by the lengths of the sentences, making the value of ranks range from 0 to 1 (for a sentence of length 5, the ranks will be normalized from 1, 2, ..., 5 to 0.2, 0.4, ..., 1). Once we collect the output ranks, we sort them in ascending order and restore them to the original characters. Then we obtain a reordered sentence. An illustration of our sorting method is shown in (A) of Figure 2.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Details of Dataset\\nTo train the visual text generation model, we constructed a dataset called TG-2M, which contains rich\\ntextual data. The images in this dataset are sourced from existing open-source datasets, including\\nMARIO-10M [5], Wukong [8], ArT [6], LSVT [27], MLT [16], ReCTS [37], TextSeg [31]. Following\\nAnyText [28], we filter the images with some rules, which can devided into three steps. Specifically,\\nthe filtering rules of the first step include:\\n\\u2022 The images of width smaller than 256 will be filtered out.\\n\\u2022 The images with aspect ratio larger than 2.0 or smaller than 0.5 will be filtered out.\\nAfter step 1, we use PP-OCR5 to detect and recognize the texts in these images. Then, we undergo\\nthe second filtering step:\\n\\u2022 The images with more than 10 texts will be filtered out.\\n\\u2022 The images with more than 3 small texts will be filtered out. The small text refers to\\nhorizontal text with a height of less than 30 pixels or vertical text with a width of less than\\n30 pixels. The orientation of the text is determined by the aspect ratio of the text bounding\\nbox, with an aspect ratio less than 0.5 considered vertical text.\\n\\u2022 Images containing more than 3 text instances with recognition scores below 0.7 will be\\nfiltered out.\\nWe use BLIP-2 [12] and Qwen-VL [1] to recaption the images. First, we generate initial captions\\nusing BLIP-2. Because some initial captions are low-quality, we then modify these captions using\\nQwen-VL. The low-quality captions are defined as those containing meaningless text or having low\\nCLIP similarity with the reference image. This process is necessary because some captions generated\\nby BLIP-2 are meaningless, as shown in Fig. 10. Additionally, although Qwen-VL\\u2019s captions are of\\nhigh quality, many of them are quite lengthy, which can affect the understanding of the CLIP text\\nencoder in the diffusion model.\\nBLIP-2 Caption: carouselell - carouselell - carouselell - carouselell - carouselell -\\ncarouselell - carouselell - carouselell \\u2013\\nQwen-VL Caption: An animated welcome message displayed by the website carousell.com. \\nIt features several icons arranged around a central circle which contains the text \\u201cCarousell\\u201d.\\nBLIP-2 Caption: car cover for car, car cover for car, car cover for car, car cover for car, car \\ncover for car.\\nQwen-VL Caption: Free shipping!

To construct the dataset, we replace each letter in the LibriSpeech transcript with an image of that letter\\u2019s ASL Alphabet symbol chosen uniformly at random from Unvoiced. To study the effect of visual variability on SSR-U, we subset the ASL Alphabet images to 100, 300, 500, or 1000 images per letter sign. The dev-clean subset of LibriSpeech is used as the validation set.\\nFingerspelling LJSpeech We train our characterlevel model on another sentence-level fngerspelling dataset constructed from LJSpeech (Ito and Johnson, 2017) and the ASL Alphabet dataset similar to the fngerspelling LibriSpeech.\\nASL LibriSpeech For the word-level SSR-U, we construct another corpus using LibriSpeech for speech and MSASL (Joze and Koller, 2019) for word-level sign videos. Since many MSASL videos no longer exist on YouTube, only $11.6\\\\mathbf{k}$ out of $25\\\\mathrm{k}$ videos are downloaded. Further, due to the mismatch in vocabulary size, we use forced alignment information to flter out LibriSpeech words that don\\u2019t appear in MSASL and keep sentences that are at least 5 words long. Next, for each word in each sentence, we pick a word-level sign video uniformly at random from MSASL. To study the effect of vocabulary size on our model, we follow the split provided by (Joze and Koller, 2019) to subset the data to a vocabulary size of 100, 200, 500 or 1000.\"}\n\n... # only display 8 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

All annotators primarily resided in the country of their nationality. Annotators could enter their ethnicity as free-text. Two identifed as Chinese, two as Malay, two as Gorontalo, and two as Asian.
