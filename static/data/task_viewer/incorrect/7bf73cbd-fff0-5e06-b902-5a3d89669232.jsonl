{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The key idea is to use a complex and high-order degradation model to mimic real-world degradations. \\nAlthough they have achieved impressive results in various scenarios, they are faced with the obstacle of evaluation. Currently, these methods are only assessed by their average performance on a small set of degradation cases randomly selected from a large space, which fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of their overall performance and often yields inconsistent and potentially misleading results.\\nTo overcome the limitation in evaluation, we propose SEAL, a framework for systematic evaluation of real-SR. In particular, we cluster the extensive degradation space to create a set of representative degradation cases, which serves as a comprehensive test set. Next, we propose a coarse-to-fine evaluation protocol to measure the distributed and relative performance of real-SR methods on the test set. The protocol incorporates two new metrics: acceptance rate (AR) and relative performance ratio (RPR), derived from acceptance and excellence lines. Under SEAL, we benchmark existing real-SR methods, obtain new observations and insights into their performance, and develop a new strong baseline. We consider SEAL as the first step towards creating an unbiased and comprehensive real-SR evaluation platform, which can promote the development of real-SR.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

We utilize two widely-used degradation mod-\\nels, BSRGAN (Zhang et al., 2021) and RealESRGAN (Wang et al., 2021b), which are designed to\\nsimulate the real-world image space. By combining the two degradation models with equal prob-\\nability [0.5, 0.5], we generate a dataset of 1 \\u00d7 104 low-quality images from the ground-truth (GT)\\nimage, lenna, from the Set14 dataset (Zeyde et al., 2010). To categorize the degraded images, we\\nemploy spectral clustering due to its effectiveness in identifying clusters of arbitrary shape, making it\\na flexible choice for our purposes. Specifically, we first use the histogram feature (Tang et al., 2011;\\nYe & Doermann, 2012) with 768 values (bins) to represent the degraded image. Then, we compute\\nthe pairwise similarities of all degraded images. Next, we implement spectral clustering based on\\nthe computed similarity matrix to generate 100 cluster centers. The degradation parameters of the\\ncluster centers are then utilized to generate the distributional test set Dtest. We take Set14 (Zeyde\\net al., 2010) and DIV2K val (Lim et al., 2017) to construct the test sets for systematic evaluation,\\ndenoted as Set14-SE and DIV2K val-SE, respectively.\\nEstablishing the acceptance and excellence lines. We use the 100 representative degradation\\nparameters to synthesize 100 training datasets based on DIV2K. In the case of MSE-based real-\\nSR methods, we utilize a variant of FSRCNN (Dong et al., 2016), referred to as FSRCNN-mz, to\\ntrain a collection of 100 non-blind SR models, which serve as acceptance line. Concurrently, we\\nemploy SRResNet (Ledig et al., 2017), following an identical procedure, as the excellence line 1.\\nThe models within the model zoo are initially pre-trained under the real-SR setting. Subsequently,\\nthey undergo a fine-tuning process consisting of a total of 2 \\u00d7 105 iterations. The Adam (Kingma\\n& Ba, 2014) optimizer with \\u03b21 = 0.9 and \\u03b22 = 0.99 is used for training. The initial learning rate is\\n2\\u00d710\\u22124. We adopt L1 loss to optimize the networks. Regarding GAN-based SR methods, we adopt\\nthe widely recognized RealESRGAN (Wang et al., 2021b) as our acceptance line.

Furthermore, we benchmark GAN-based real-SR methods such as ESRGAN (Wang et al.,\\n2018), DASR (Liang et al., 2022), BSRGAN (Zhang et al., 2021), MMRealSR (Mou et al., 2022),\\nSwinIR (Liang et al., 2021a). We also modify SRGAN (Ledig et al., 2017) to achieve RealSRGAN\\nunder the RealESRGAN training setting.\\nThe visualization of the distributed performance offers a comprehensive insight into real-SR\\nperformance. Fig. 4 illustrates the distribution performance for MSE-based real-SR methods, using\\nPSNR as the IQA metric. On the other hand, Fig. 6 depicts the distribution performance for GAN-\\nbased real-SR methods, with LPIPS as the metric. Both visualizations are generated using our\\nproposed SE test set. The SE test sets are arranged in ascending order based on the PSNR values\\nof the acceptance line output. Test sets with lower numbers represent more challenging cases. It\\u2019s\\nnoticeable that there are a few degradation cases that fall significantly below the acceptance line\\nin Fig. 4. Interestingly, real-SR methods seem to perform better on more challenging degradation\\ncases. This is evident in test datasets 0-20 in Fig. 4 and 80-100 in Fig. 6.\\nThe coarse-to-fine evaluation protocol offers a systematic ranking. In Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, the real-\\nSR models with AR below 0.25 are excluded from the ranking due to their low acceptance rates. For\\nthe real-SR models with AR > 0.25, a step-by-step ranking is performed based on {AR, RRPI,\\nRPRA, RPRU}, with thresholds {0.02, 0.02, 0.05, 0.05} respectively. If the difference in the cur-\\nrent metric exceeds the threshold, the metric is used to represent the overall ranking. Otherwise,\\nthe next metric is considered. From our proposed SEAL evaluation, we can make several observa-\\ntions: (1) Some existing methods fail on the majority of degradation cases. The AR values of\\nsome existing methods are below 0.5, as shown in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2. For instance, most MSE-based\\nreal-SR models can not even outperform the small network (i.e., FSRCNN-mz) in most degrada-\\ntion cases. (2) Our SEAL is capable of ranking existing methods across various dimensions,\\nsuch as robustness, denoted by RPRI and performance bound indicated by RPRA. In Tab. 2,\\nthe metric learning based MMRealSR achieves significant robustness (RPRI 0.08) compared with\\n7\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nthe transformer-based SwinIR (RPRI 0.24). Therefore, under our current coarse-to-fine evaluation\\nprotocol, MMRealSR is ranked in the first place. Interestingly, we observed that SwinIR achieves\\na higher RPRA at the same AR level. If the user prioritizes the performance of acceptance cases,\\nSwinIR would be a better choice. Consequently, we can also flexibly set RPRA as the first finer\\nmetric. In this way, SwinIR would take the first place. (3) The acceptance line serves as a useful\\nreference line for visual comparison. Visual results are presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. 7. It\\u2019s evi-\\ndent that the visual results of the acceptance line can serve as a basic need for image quality, while\\nthe visual results of the excellence line represent the upper bound of image quality under the cur-\\nrent evaluation protocol. The visuals below the acceptance line clearly exhibit unacceptable visual\\neffects, including blurring (as seen in the crocodile results of RealSRGAN and DASR in Fig. 7),\\nover-sharpening (as seen in the text results of RealESRNet in Fig. 5), and other artifacts. Notably,\\nour SEAL can flexibly use new reference lines for future needs.\\n5.3\\nCOMPARISON WITH THE CONVENTIONAL EVALUATION\\nHere, we compare our SEAL with the conventional strategy (Zhang et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2022)\\nused for evaluating real-SR models.\\nRandomly generated multiple synthetic test sets fail to establish a clear ranking with distinct\\ndifferences. We randomly sample 100 degradation cases and add them to Set14 to obtain 100 test\\nsets (Set14-Random). Tab. 3 shows that 1) the mean and standard deviations (std) of PSNR obtained\\non the two Set14-Random100 datasets show significant inconsistency, demonstrating the presence\\nof high randomness and variability in the sampled degradation cases. 2) On our Set14-SE (formed\\nwith the 100 representative cases), the means and stds of the compared methods are very close,\\nmaking it hard to establish a clear ranking with distinct differences among the methods. In contrast,\\nour SEAL offers a definitive ranking of these methods based on their AR scores, offering a new\\nsystematic evaluation view.\\nTable 3: Comparison with multiple synthetic test sets on mean and standard deviations.\\nSet14-Random100 (#1) Set14-Random100 (#2)\\nSet14-SE\\nPSNR \\u2191\\nmean \\u2191\\nstd \\u2193\\nmean \\u2191\\nstd \\u2193\\nmean\\nstd\\nAR \\u2191\\nRPRI \\u2193RPRA \\u2191RPRU \\u2191rank\\nBSRNet\\n23.39(3)\\n1.56(2)\\n22.98(1)\\n1.64(1)\\n22.77(2) 1.65(1) 0.59(1)\\n0.42(4)\\n0.72(2)\\n0.27(4)\\n1\\nRealESRNet-GD 23.72(1)\\n1.64(4)\\n22.98(1)\\n1.95(4)\\n22.82(1) 1.83(4) 0.43(2)\\n0.37(3)\\n0.74(1)\\n0.33(1)\\n2\\nSwinIR\\n23.25(4)\\n1.62(3)\\n22.79(4)\\n1.69(2)\\n22.61(4) 1.69(2) 0.41(3)\\n0.24(1)\\n0.58(4)\\n0.29(2)\\n3\\nRealESRNet\\n23.54(2)\\n1.55(1)\\n22.80(3)\\n1.83(3)\\n22.67(3) 1.73(3) 0.27(4)\\n0.28(2)\\n0.63(3)\\n0.28(3)\\n4\\nThe utilization of a randomly generated synthetic test set may lead to misleading outcomes.\\nFollowing Zhang et al. (2021); Liang et al. (2022), we randomly add degradations to images in the\\nDIV2K (Agustsson & Timofte, 2017) validation set to construct a single real-DIV2K val set. Tab. 4\\nshows that RealESRNet achieves a higher average PSNR than BSRNet (24.93dB vs. 24.77dB) on\\nreal-DIV2K val, leading to the misleading impression that RealESRNet is superior than BSRNet.\\nHowever, our SEAL framework leads to a contrary conclusion. BSRNet obtains much higher PSNR\\n(24.74dB vs. 24.43dB) and AR value (0.55 vs. 0.15) than RealESRNet on our DIV2K val-SE,\\nillustrating that the former outperforms the latter in most representative degradation cases.\\nTable 4: Comparison with the single synthetic test set.

We compute the variance of the similarity matrices for each of these datasets, which\\nare 8.32, 8.45, 8.68, and 8.71, respectively.

This observation\\nsuggests that a sample size of 5000 random degradations sufficiently represents the degradation\\nspace. However, to ensure the highest possible accuracy in our results, we opted to use 10000\\ndegradation samples for the clustering process.\\nTable 5: The purity accuracy of the cluster-\\ning results with different similarity metrics on\\nBlur100, Noise100, and BN100 datasets.\\nRange\\nK\\nMSE\\nSSIM\\nHistogram\\nBlur100\\n0.1 - 4\\n4\\n78.2%\\n78.2%\\n80.2%\\nNoise100\\n1 - 40\\n4\\n39.6%\\n34.6%\\n80.2%\\nBlur100 + Noise100\\n-\\n8\\n51.7%\\n58.2%\\n80.5%\\nChoice of similarity metric. We compare differ-\\nent metrics that are used to compute the similarity\\nmatrix for degradation clustering, including MSE,\\nSSIM, and histogram similarity. In Tab. 5, the pu-\\nrity accuracy of the clustering results using MSE\\nor SSIM is significantly lower than that with his-\\ntogram similarity, especially when noise is consid-\\nered. Thus, we adopt histogram similarity as the\\nsimilarity metric.\\nChoice of the number of clusters. Our goal is to\\ngenerate as many representative classes as possible while maintaining the clustering quality so that\\nthe class centers can serve as representative cases. The results in Fig. 8 show the performance of\\nRealESRNet and BSRNet becomes stable as k approaches 100, with minimal variations observed\\nfor k = 60, 80, 100. Therefore, to achieve a more comprehensive assessment and strike a balance\\nbetween clustering quality and time cost, we set k = 100 without further increasing its value. In\\nthe appendix, we have included the quantitative results of the silhouette score (Rousseeuw, 1987), a\\nmetric commonly employed to evaluate the quality of clusters.\\nStability of degradation clustering for real-SR evaluation. In Fig. 9, we study the stability of\\ndegradation clustering by using different images as a reference for evaluation. Beyond the Lenna\\nimage, our study incorporated four additional images\\u2014specifically, Baboon, Barbara, Flowers, and\\nZebra\\u2014from the Set14 dataset. These images were employed as Ground Truth images in the con-\\nstruction of the clustering dataset, adhering to the same degradation clustering process. Despite\\nusing different reference images, our results show that the average PSNR of BSRNet is consistently\\nhigher than that of RealESRNet by more than 0.1dB, indicating that our degradation clustering\\nmethod exhibits excellent stability for real-SR evaluation.\\n6\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

Furthermore, by leveraging the capabilities of the Lightning\\npackage, PINA adapts to various hardware setups, including GPUs and TPUs.\\nThis adaptability positions PINA as an ideal candidate for the transition of these\\nmethodologies into production and industrial pipelines, where computational effi-\\nciency and scalability are of paramount importance.

In this\\npaper, we propose a role-playing system, namely GUARD (Guideline Uphold-\\ning through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics), which can automatically follow the\\ngovernment-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow\\nthe guidelines accordingly. GUARD works by assigning four different roles to\\nLLMs to collaborate jailbreaks, in the style of the human generation.\\nWe have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge\\nopen-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a\\nwidely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT).

These usages of LLMs are often different from widely accepted ethical\\nnorms and thus can potentially lead to unforeseen consequences. Therefore, there is a need for these\\napplications to be appropriately regulated.\\nIn response, the government and other authoritative organizations have recently issued preliminary\\nguidelines to regulate the usage and development of LLMs (Smuha, 2019). Most of these guidelines\\nsuggest that the usage of LLMs needs to refuse responses to malicious queries such as \\u201cHow to\\nhotwire a car?\\u201d, \\u201cHow to make a bomb?\\u201d, etc.\\nIn addition, LLM developers have integrated various safety mechanisms to defend the models from\\nsuch malicious usage (Alon & Kamfonas, 2023; Xie et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). These multiple\\nbuilt-in features include detecting malicious queries by natural language filter (Alon & Kamfonas,\\n2023), adding self-reminded prompts to force LLMs to rethink queries to determine whether they\\nare malicious (Xie et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), and promptly halting the responses of LLMs\\nwhen LLMs try to response potential malicious content (Jain et al., 2023).\\nHowever, these programmed safety mechanisms are not effective enough to guarantee the LLMs\\nwill behave in adherence to the issued guidelines.

Current scaling laws show that\\nlearning from such data requires an abundance of both compute and data, which\\ngrows with the size of the model being trained. This is infeasible both because\\nof the large compute costs and duration associated with pre-training, and the\\nimpending scarcity of high-quality data on the web.

At the same pre-training\\ncompute budget, it improves perplexity by more than 10% on average across\\ndifferent subsets of the Pile, and improves zero-shot question answer accuracy\\nacross 13 tasks by more than 2%. Second, we investigate the impact of the re-\\nphrasing style on the performance of the model, offering insights into how the\\ncomposition of the training data can impact the performance of LLMs in OOD\\nsettings.

Data curation strategies\\nare required to filter out scrapes of the web that are unstructured and\\/or poorly phrased (Eisenstein,\\n2013). While some of these strategies have been made public (Brown et al., 2020; Wenzek et al.,\\n2020; Penedo et al., 2023), most state-of-the-art data curation techniques are unknown to the research\\ncommunity, and only anecdotal evidence remains. Research on data curation requires multiple\\nrounds of re-training, making it an expensive endeavour to document techniques that lead to practical\\nimprovements. On the other hand, scaling laws for language models (such as Chinchilla scaling\\nlaws (Hoffmann et al., 2022)) show that with increasing model sizes, we should also increase both\\nthe training compute and data size linearly. This is infeasible because (a) high-quality data is limited\\n(Villalobos et al., 2022), and repeating for even a small number of epochs (4 or more) results in\\ndiminishing returns or overfitting (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Xue et al., 2023);\\nand (b) pre-training for such long durations is prohibitively expensive.\\nMeanwhile, the use of synthetic data has gained prominence in the paradigm of aligning pre-trained\\nLLMs via instruction fine-tuning, RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), and instruction backtranslation (Li\\net al., 2023b). Recently, in the context of pre-training, synthetic data was used to generate datasets\\nsuch as Tiny Stories (Eldan & Li, 2023) and Textbook quality synthetic data (Gunasekar et al., 2023;\\nLi et al., 2023c).

Additionally, such data generation can create \\u201cknowledge bias\\u201d by\\ngenerating data pertaining to tasks that we want to perform well on.

In particular,\\nextending LLMs to handle multiple modalities has gathered much interest from both academia and\\nindustry. Such models, termed Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), are typically derived\\nby finetuning a pretrained LLM on multi-modal data (Liu et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023). However,\\nthis process typically poses a substantial computational challenge (Liu et al., 2023), particularly\\nfor exceptionally large-scale models. While Su et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023) employ low-rank\\nadapters (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022) or soft prompts (Li & Liang, 2021a) for more parameter-efficient\\ntuning, this often comes at the cost of compromised performance on multi-modal tasks. This challenge\\nprompts the pivotal question: how can we make this process more efficient?\\nIn response to this challenge, we introduce a simple and effective strategy for MLLM finetuning:\\nas illustrated in Figure 1(a), within each attention block, we adjust only the weights of the Layer-\\nNorm (Ba et al., 2016). This strategy is underpinned by the understanding that the evolution from\\nLLMs to MLLMs can be conceptualized as a domain adaptation process, i.e., transitioning from text-\\ncentric to multi-modal understanding. Adjusting normalization layers, as suggested by prior research,\\nemerges as a particularly effective technique in such domain shifts (Li et al., 2016). Empirically, this\\nstraightforward technique can surprisingly yield comparable or even better performance than the\\nstrong baseline of finetuning all parameters offer about 10\\u00d7 more parameter efficiency than LoRA.\\nBy delving deeper, we note that the process can be further simplified by designating LayerNorm as the\\nsole trainable component within the entire model. This means, in contrast to the typical configurations\\ndepicted in Figure 1(a)-(c), we now freeze the standardly activated elements, including the vision-\\nlanguage connector, word embedding, and the output head. We term it as LayerNorm-simple.\\nImpressively, despite constituting a mere 0.004% of trainable parameters, this configuration surpasses\\nthe performance of LoRA, registering an average enhancement of 4.3% across five benchmarks.\\n1\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nAUTOLORA: AN AUTOMATED ROBUST FINE-TUNING\\nFRAMEWORK\\nXilie Xu1\\nJingfeng Zhang2,3,\\u2020\\nMohan Kankanhalli1\\n1 School of Computing, National University of Singapore\\n2 School of Computer Science, The University of Auckland\\n3 RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)\\n{xuxilie, mohan}@comp.nus.edu.sg, jingfeng.zhang@auckland.ac.nz\\nABSTRACT\\nRobust Fine-Tuning (RFT) is a low-cost strategy to obtain adversarial robustness\\nin downstream applications, without requiring a lot of computational resources\\nand collecting significant amounts of data.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a low-rank (LoRa) branch\\nthat disentangles RFT into two distinct components: optimizing natural objec-\\ntives via the LoRa branch and adversarial objectives via the FE. Besides, we in-\\ntroduce heuristic strategies for automating the scheduling of the learning rate and\\nthe scalars of loss terms.

Our source code is available at the GitHub.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nWith the emergence of foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), fine-tuning the pre-trained\\nfeature extractor (FE) has become a low-cost strategy to obtain superior performance in downstream\\ntasks. Notably, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on\\nGLUE benchmarks (Wang et al., 2018) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021). Due\\nto the ubiquitous existence of adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Madry et al., 2018; Xu\\net al., 2022), adopting pre-trained FEs to safety-critical downstream areas such as medicine (Buch\\net al., 2018) and autonomous cars (Kurakin et al., 2018) necessitates the strategy of robust fine-\\ntuning (Hendrycks et al., 2019) that can yield adversarial robustness in downstream applications.\\nRobust fine-tuning (RFT) (Hendrycks et al., 2019) that contains an adversarial objective to learn\\nfeatures of adversarial data (Madry et al., 2018) can gain adversarial robustness in downstream\\ntasks. To further improve generalization, vanilla RFT (formulated in Eq. 1, shown in the left panel\\nof Figure 1c) optimizes both adversarial and natural objectives to learn the features of adversarial\\nand natural data simultaneously via the FE (Zhang et al., 2019; Shafahi et al., 2019; Jiang et al.,\\n2020). Recently, TWINS (Liu et al., 2023) (formulated in Eq. 2) further enhances performance in\\ndownstream tasks by incorporating vanilla RFT with a dual batch normalization (BN) (Xie et al.,\\n2020; Wang et al., 2020) module. TWINS takes advantage of extra information from the pre-trained\\nFE (i.e., pre-trained statistics in a frozen BN) via the dual BN module, thus improving performance.\\nHowever, we empirically find that vanilla RFT and TWINS have a common issue, where optimizing\\nboth adversarial and natural objectives via the FE leads to significantly divergent gradient directions.\\nAs shown in Figure 1a, the cosine similarity between the gradient of natural and adversarial objective\\n\\u2020 Corresponding author.\\n1\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 5 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Furthermore,\\nthe majority of existing studies do not provide metrics to quantitatively measure a model\\u2019s ability to\\nreplicate diverse behaviors, often relying solely on qualitative analysis (Shafiullah et al., 2022).\\nTo address these challenges, this work introduces benchmark environments and the corresponding\\nDatasets with Diverse Human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning (D3IL).

A core characteristic of these\\nFoundation Models (Bommasani et al., 2021) is that they are trained on hundreds of millions or even\\nbillions of data points scraped from the internet. For example, OpenCLIP (Schuhmann et al., 2022),\\nthe open-source version of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), is trained on LAION-400M, a web-scale\\ndataset with a wide variety of image-text pairs (Schuhmann et al., 2021). CLIP forms the backbone of\\ngenerative models like DALL-E2 (Ramesh et al., 2022) and is known for its remarkable zero-shot and\\nfew-shot performance on a wide range of tasks, specifically on out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks\\nlike ImageNet-Sketch (Wang et al., 2019), ImageNet-R (Hendrycks et al., 2020), etc.\\nPrior work has shown that CLIP\\u2019s stellar performance stems mainly from its data distribution (Fang\\net al., 2022; Radford et al., 2021).

We provide evidence in Fig. 1 where we choose\\nsamples from ImageNet-Sketch and ImageNet-R and examine their nearest perceptual neighbors in\\nLAION-400M and ImageNet-Train. We find highly similar neighbors and even exact duplicates in\\nLAION-400M while neighbors in ImageNet-Train are relatively dissimilar. In other words, models\\ntrained on LAION-400M may perform well on conventional OOD benchmarks simply due to being\\ntrained on semantically and stylistically similar data points. Naturally, the question arises:\\nDoes CLIP\\u2019s accuracy on OOD benchmarks mainly stem from highly similar images in its train set?\\nBy highly similar images, we mean images that are stylistically and semantically more similar to\\nthe test sets than any image in ImageNet-1k is. To answer this question, we make the following\\ncontributions:\\n\\u2022 In Sec. 4.1, we begin by introducing perceptual similarity (Ilharco et al., 2021), which has previously\\nbeen shown to capture stylistic and semantic similarity between images (Fu et al., 2023; Gadre\\net al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2021). We show in Sec. 4.2 that the similarity of nearest neighbors under\\nthis metric generally impacts CLIP\\u2019s performance. Specifically, we (i) observe a high correlation\\nbetween zero-shot accuracy and nearest-neighbor similarity of test samples and (ii) demonstrate\\nthat similarity-based pruning of the training set greatly affects CLIP\\u2019s performance.\\n\\u2022 Based on these insights, we compare the distribution of nearest-neighbor similarities of different\\ntraining sets in Sec. 4.3 and find that they differ substantially. We hypothesize that CLIP\\u2019s high\\nperformance might be largely explained by the training samples that cause this difference, which\\nwe term highly similar images.\\n\\u2022 Sec. 4.4 formalizes the notion of highly similar images based on the similarity gap of two training\\ndistributions. Under this formalization, highly similar images of LAION-400M lie within the\\nsimilarity gap of ImageNet-Train to a given test set, i.e., are more similar to test samples than\\nany image in ImageNet-Train is. We go on to show how pruning can align the similarity gap of\\nboth distributions, such that test sets are as dissimilar to pruned LAION-400M-splits as they are to\\nImageNet-Train.\\n\\u2022 As our central result in Sec. 5, we surprisingly find that training CLIP on the curated subsets\\nonly marginally decreases performance on the corresponding OOD benchmarks (Tab. 1). We\\nconclude that high train-test similarity cannot fully explain CLIP\\u2019s remarkable performance, and\\nother properties of LAION-400M must play a role.\\n\\u2022 To facilitate future research into the impact of training on the performance of vision-language\\nfoundation models, we curate a 100M subset of LAION-400M (\\u00bc of its original size) on which\\nCLIP maintains its full OOD benchmark performance (Sec. 4.2 & B.4).\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"INTRODUCTION\\nVideo understanding has evolved rapidly due to the increasing number of online videos.

However, swapping the channel order can only lead to discrete\\nvariations and the generated video may follow a fixed pattern. Thus, we further mix the original\\nvideo and the generated video with linear interpolation to enlarge the input space. In this manner, we\\ncan efficiently alter the hue value of video samples and simulate the effect of appearance variation.\\nNevertheless, it is worth noting that videos generated by SwapMix may exhibit unrealistic appear-\\nances, e.g., green-colored hands and football, which are unlikely to occur in the real world. Although\\nSwapMix effectively enlarges the training set, the augmented samples will result in distribution shift\\ncompared to the original training set which may limit its performance. To address this issue, we pro-\\npose Variation Alignment (VA) to construct training pairs with different appearances and encourage\\ntheir predictions to align with each other. By providing the network with the prior knowledge of\\n\\u2018what is the relation between inputs with different variations\\u2019, we can enforce the model to learn\\nappearance invariant representation, which is shown to be beneficial for video understanding.\\nConsidering SwapMix and Variation Alignment (VA) in a uniform manner, we build Motion Coher-\\nent Augmentation (MCA), which efficiently generates video with new appearances and resolves the\\ndistribution shift caused by appearance variation. In this way, we can implicitly guide the model to\\nprioritize the motion pattern in videos, instead of solely relying on static appearance for predictions.\\nNotably, most training pipelines do not consider the effect of hue variance, which means that MCA is\\ncompatible with existing data augmentation approaches and can further improve the generalization\\nability of competing methods like Uniformer Li et al. (2022a). Moreover, we conduct experiments\\nto validate that VA, as a plug-in module, can resolve the distribution shift of other data augmentation\\nmethods for even better performance. We summarize the contributions as follows:\\n\\u2022 Despite its negative impact on object recognition, we reveal that Hue Jittering is beneficial\\nin video understanding as appearance variance does not affect the action conveyed by video.\\n\\u2022 We propose a data augmentation method Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA) to learn\\nthe appearance invariant representation for video understanding.

An inter-\\nesting observation by Ilyas et al. (2019) has shown that a neural network, trained on adversarial\\nexamples labeled by such incorrect classes, can generalize to correctly labeled test samples. Specif-\\nically, the training procedure is as follows:1\\nDefinition 1.1 (Learning from adversarial perturbations (later redefined) (Ilyas et al., 2019)). Let\\nD := {(xn, yn)}N\\nn=1 be a training dataset, where xn denotes an input (e.g., an image) and yn\\ndenotes the corresponding label. Let f be a classifier trained on D. For each n, an adversarial\\nexample xadv\\nn\\nis produced by imposing an adversarial perturbation on xn to increase the probability\\nfor a target label yadv\\nn\\n\\u0338= yn given by f, constructing Dadv := {(xadv\\nn\\n, yadv\\nn\\n)}N\\nn=1. Training a\\nclassifier from scratch on Dadv is called learning from adversarial perturbations.\\nNotably, a training sample xadv appears almost identical to x to humans, but is always labeled\\nas a different class yadv \\u0338= y (e.g., an adversarially perturbed, yet semantically unchanged, horse\\nimage with a cat label). Counterintuitively, networks can learn to classify correctly labeled test\\nsamples (e.g., a cat image with a cat label) from such mislabeled adversarial samples.\\nThe unexpected success of training on mislabeled adversarial examples suggests that adversarial\\nperturbations may contain label-aligned features. For example, frog adversarial images labeled as\\nhorses have perturbations that appear as noises to humans but contain horse features. This feature\\n1This is neither adversarial training nor training with (partially) noisy labels (cf. Appendix A).\\n1\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nhypothesis not only explains the counterintuitive generalization of learning from perturbations, but\\nalso sheds light on several puzzling phenomena of adversarial examples, such as why adversarial\\nexamples can fool classifiers and transfer among them (cf. Section 2).\\nWhile the feature hypothesis is considered a potential explanation for adversarial perturbations, a\\ntheoretical understanding of this hypothesis and its empirical foundation, learning from perturba-\\ntions, remains limited. For example, it is still unknown how adversarial perturbations contain class\\nfeatures. The similarity in decision boundaries between the network trained on clean and mislabeled\\nadversarial samples is also unknown.\\nIn this study, we provide the first theoretical validation of the learnability from adversarial perturba-\\ntions. Using recent results on the decision boundary of a one-hidden-layer neural network trained on\\nmutually orthogonal samples (Frei et al., 2023), we show that perturbations contain sufficient class\\nfeatures for generalization. In addition, we demonstrate that the decision boundary when learn-\\ning from perturbations is consistent with that from natural samples except for specific regions under\\nmild conditions. While Ilyas et al. (2019) empirically considered only the case where L2-constrained\\nperturbations were superimposed on natural data, our theory covers broader settings. We reveal that\\neven sparse perturbations, perturbations of a few pixels, contain class features and enable gener-\\nalization. Moreover, we show that the alignment of decision boundaries derived from adversarial\\nperturbations and natural samples becomes stronger when perturbations are superimposed on ran-\\ndom noises. The main contributions are summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 We theoretically justified the feature hypothesis and learning from perturbations with one-\\nhidden-layer neural networks trained on mutually orthogonal training samples.\\n\\u2022 We showed that various adversarial perturbations including sparse perturbations can be rep-\\nresented by the weighted sum of benign training samples. This suggests that perturbations,\\nyet apparently uninterpretable, contain sufficient class features for generalization.\\n\\u2022 We demonstrated that classifiers learning from mislabeled adversarial samples produce\\nconsistent predictions with those from clean samples under mild conditions. Moreover,\\nclassifiers trained on random noises with perturbations provide accurate predictions for\\nnatural data even though the classifiers do not see any natural data during training.\\n2\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

We use the MixInstruct dataset from (Jiang et al., 2023) to evaluate the effectiveness of\\ndifferent routing strategies. MixInstruct consists of a wide range of tasks (e.g., question answering,\\nsummarization, information extraction) and enables us to train a generic router that will be effective\\nacross different scenarios. We present additional information about this dataset in Appendix B.\\nRouter Model. We use DeBERTa-v3-large (He et al., 2020) (300M) as the backbone to train our\\nrouters. We train each router with the corresponding loss from Section 3 for 5 epochs and use\\nthe validation set to choose the best checkpoints for final evaluation. All experiments are con-\\nducted with 1 NVIDIA A100 GPU of 80GB GPU RAM. We have made our source code available\\nat https:\\/\\/github.com\\/m365-core\\/hybrid llm routing.\\nEvaluation Measures. We use BART score (Yuan et al., 2021) as the quality metric and use fraction\\nof queries routed to the small model (cost advantage) as the efficiency metric (see Section 2.3).\\nBaselines. We consider three baselines: all-at-large, all-at-small, and random. All-at-large routes\\nall queries to the large model, while all-at-small routes all queries to the small model. Random gen-\\nerates a random number in [0,1] and selects the large model if it is below the probability threshold.\\nExperiments. We investigate all three routers: rdet, rprob, and rtrans. We select candidate model\\npairs from FLAN-T5 (800m), FLAN-T5 (11b), Llama-2 (7b), Llama-2 (13b), and GPT-3.5-turbo\\nfor our experiments. At test time the trained router (rdet, rprob, or rtrans) takes a threshold value as\\ninput and routes all queries with router score higher than the threshold to the small model as these\\nare the easy queries. We evaluate the router performance in Section 4.2 in terms of both BART\\nscore and cost advantage (Figure 5 and Table 1), validate that the router is indeed routing easy\\nqueries to the small model in Section 4.3, demonstrate that our routers are of negligible compute\\noverhead in Appendix A.1, show how to choose routing thresholds in practice in Appendix A.2,\\nevaluate the effectiveness of our routers using a response quality metric other than the BART score\\nin Appendix A.3, and test the generalizability of routers across model pairs in Appendix A.4.\\n4.2\\nROUTER PERFORMANCE RESULTS\\nSmall performance gap.

Numerical comparison results are summarized in Table 1. rdet routes 20%\\n(40%) queries to the small model i.e. Llama-2 (7b) with only 0.1% (0.2%) drop in response quality\\nw.r.t. the all-at-large baseline. Impressively rprob and rtrans achieve 20% cost advantages without\\nany quality drop, and rtrans is able to achieve even 20% cost advantage without quality drop, which\\ncan be attributed to these methods capturing the non-deterministic nature of LLMs.\\nMedium performance gap. Often there is only a moderate performance gap between leading open-\\nsource LLMs like Llama-2 (13b) and state-of-the-art commodified LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo\\n(Figure 5b). In this case, all our routers deliver reasonable cost advantages with acceptable quality\\ndrop. The effectiveness order between rdet, rprob, and rtrans resembles that in the small quality gap\\ncase. All routers achieve 20% (40%) cost advantage with \\u22641% (\\u22644%) quality drop (Table 1). In\\nthe 40% cost advantage regime, rprob slightly outperforms rdet and rtrans improves rprob by 0.5%\\nin terms of quality drop.\\nLarge performance gap. In the edge-cloud routing scenarios, edge devices often have very limited\\nresources and can only support small models of limited quality, which can be significantly outper-\\nformed by large models deployed on the cloud. We investigate how to effectively route queries with\\nLLM pairs of large performance gaps, such as FLAN-t5 (800m) and Llama-2 (13b) (Figure 5c).\\nNon-trivial routing is challenging in this situation since the large model dominates for a majority\\nof examples. Both rdet and rprob perform marginally better than the random routing baseline. In\\ncontrast, rtrans can still effectively distinguish relatively easy queries from the harder ones. rtrans\\nachieves 40% cost advantages with 10.3% quality drop, which is 3.5% and 2.8% lower than rdet\\nand rprob respectively (Table 1).\\nIn the course of these experiments we made two interesting observations. Firstly, when the cost\\nadvantage is modest (e.g., 10%) and the LLM performance gaps are not large (e.g., Llama-2 (7b) v.s.\\nLlama-2 (13b)) rprob is able to achieve even better performance than all-at-large which leads to the\\n\\u201cnegative quality drops\\u201d in Table 1. This is because, as seen from the large value of Pr[H(x) \\u22650]\\nin the tail distribution in Figure 5, the response quality of the small model may be higher than that\\nof the large model for several queries and by routing these queries to the small model, the router is\\nable to even beat all-at-large. Secondly, for lower cost advantages (\\u226410%) and small or moderate\\nLLM performance gaps rtrans can be slightly outperformed by rdet or rprob. This might be due\\nnoise in the estimation of the relaxation parameter t from sample averages instead of expectation in\\nEquation (3) and from the grid search process leading to suboptimal settings of rtrans. However we\\nclearly see that in more challenging routing scenarios with high cost advantage targets or large LLM\\n8\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n(a) Small performance diff.\\n(b) Medium quality gaps.\\n(c) Large quality gaps.\\nFigure 6: Difference between average quality gap of queries routed to the small and large models\\nwith different performance gaps.\\nperformance gaps, both rdet and rprob have difficulty in correctly routing queries, and rtrans starts\\nto dominate due to the benefits of the data transformation.\\n4.3\\nROUTER VALIDATION RESULTS\\nWe also validate that the router is functioning as intended, that is, routing easy queries to the small\\nmodel and hard queries to the large model. To see this, in Figure 6 we plot the difference between\\nthe average quality gaps of queries routed to the small model and those routed to the large model\\nfor our router and the random baseline v\\/s different values of cost advantages (i.e., the fraction of\\nqueries routed to the small model). Since the random baseline randomly assigns queries the average\\ndifference is nearly always zero. However our router routes easy queries i.e. queries with large\\nquality gap (q(S(x)) \\u2212q(L(x))) to the small model and queries with small quality gap to the large\\nmodel. Hence the difference between the average quality gaps always has a significant positive\\nvalue indicating that more easy queries are routed to the small model than to the large model in our\\napproach as compared to the random assignment approach at all cost advantages.\\n5\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"EVALUATION\\nAblation on window sizes Table 3 shows the zero-shot performance of our model with different\\nwindow sizes w.\\nModel Prompts\\nWe present a collection of prompts used in the zero-shot classification prompt ensembles in Ta-\\nble 4.

Table 1 shows the accuracy and training FLOPs of training from scratch\\nexperiments. We apply our proposed SIMWNW framework to two SSL frameworks SimCLR and\\nSimSiam for evaluation. We compare our framework with a recognized activation gradient pruning\\napproach Back Razor (Jiang et al., 2022), which prunes the activation gradient with lower mag-\\nnitudes to reduce computation costs. In our experiments, we modulate the pruning ratio of Back\\nRazor to ensure a similar accuracy to SIMWNW. As shown in the table, compared to the SimCLR\\nand SimSiam baselines, SIMWNW provides impressive training FLOPs savings, peaking at 54%\\nand averaging at 40%. Importantly, this computational advantage does not come at the expense of\\naccuracy. In comparison with Back Razor, SIMWNW reduces training FLOPs by up to 25%, with\\nan average savings of 18%.\\nTransfer learning. In addition to the training from scratch tasks, we further evaluate the perfor-\\nmance of SIMWNW on transfer learning tasks. The experimental results are shown in Table 2. As\\none can observe, compared to SimCLR and SimSiam baselines, SIMWNW showcases a commend-\\nable reduction in computation costs without compromising accuracy, peaking at 51% and averaging\\nat 48%. When compared to Back Razor, SIMWNW manages to reduce computation costs by up to\\n23%, with an average saving of 14%.\\nWith the savings in training FLOPs, SIMWNW is able to reduce the training time by 24% on aver-\\nage. We also present the accuracy results when SimCLR and SimSiam baselines consume the same\\ntraining FLOPs with our proposed SIMWNW in Tables 1 and 2, and we can see that SIMWNW con-\\nsistently provides significantly higher accuracy (3.5% on average) compared to them. The com-\\nmendable performance of SIMWNW can be attributed to its astute focus on the intrinsic features\\nof augmented images. By eliminating regions of less significance, it not only reduces computation\\ncosts but also removes unnecessary noise or irrelevant features that might mislead or slow down the\\nlearning process (Wang et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2016). Therefore, it allows the model to learn fea-\\nture extraction capabilities faster. In other words, the model can converge in fewer epochs, offering\\nfurther computation savings.\\n8\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\n0\\n1.3\\n2.5\\n3.8\\nAccuracy (%)\\nTraining Hours\\nSimCLR\\nSimCLR+SimWnW\\n70\\n80\\n90\\n100\\n0\\n1.2\\n2.4\\n3.6\\nAccuracy (%)\\nTraining Hours\\nSimSiam\\nSimSiam+SimWnW\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nSaving\\nSaving\\nFigure 6: The convergence of ResNet18 on CIFAR-10\\ndataset of training from scratch experiments.\\nFigure 6 depicts an example of model con-\\nvergence of training from scratch experi-\\nment on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The\\nbreakdown of computation savings, de-\\nrived from i) skipping convolution compu-\\ntation for removed regions, and ii) accel-\\nerating model convergence, are detailed in Appendix D. We also present a detailed discussion on\\nhow the computation savings translate into training time reduction in Appendix E. On the other\\nhand, Back Razor keeps dense activation during forward propagation, which means it could miss\\nopportunities for computation saving.\\nWe also conduct other experiments to evaluate SIMWNW, including comparison and compatibility\\nto some efficient self-supervised learning frameworks (Appendices A.1, A.2, and A.3), experiments\\non vision transformers (Appendix A.4), and transferability experiments (Appendix A.5).\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n-1.0\\n2.0\\n5.0\\n8.0\\n11.0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\nTraining Cost (%)\\nAccuracy Drop (%)\\nSimilarity Threshold\\nAccuracy Drop\\nTraining Cost\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n-1.0\\n1.0\\n3.0\\n5.0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\nTraining Cost (%)\\nAccuracy Drop (%)\\nBlock Size\\nAccuracy Drop\\nTraining Cost\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFigure 7: (a) Effect of different similarity thresholds.

Figure 7a shows accuracy drop and training FLOPs\\n(compared to SimCLR and SimSiam baselines) when the similarity threshold varies. As expected,\\nhigher thresholds indicate fewer similar block pairs being removed, thus leading to a lower accuracy\\ndrop but a higher training computation cost. When the similarity threshold reaches a sufficiently\\nhigh value (e.g., 20), the accuracy essentially remains stable. However, for applications that are not\\nparticularly sensitive to accuracy, opting for an aggressive threshold can save more computation.\\nWe also study the impact of the block size when we conduct block-matching on augmented images.\\nAs shown in Figure 7b, a larger block size results in a lower accuracy drop but higher training\\ncosts. The reason behind this is that a larger block captures more features and details. As the two\\naugmented images have different transformations applied, the aggregated difference over a larger\\nblock will be more pronounced than in a smaller block. Therefore, a larger block size indicates fewer\\nblocks are considered similar. It is worth noting that the optimal block size is tied to the dimension\\nof input images. Users have the flexibility to tailor the block size to suit specific applications.
