{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, the inherent diversity in human behavior leads to the emergence of multi-modal data distributions, thereby presenting a formidable challenge for existing imitation learning algorithms. Quantifying a model's capacity to capture and replicate this diversity effectively is still an open problem. In this work, we introduce simulation benchmark environments and the corresponding *Datasets with Diverse human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning (D3IL)*, designed explicitly to evaluate a model's ability to learn multi-modal behavior. Our environments are designed to involve multiple sub-tasks that need to be solved, consider manipulation of multiple objects which increases the diversity of the behavior and can only be solved by policies that rely on closed loop sensory feedback. Other available datasets are missing at least one of these challenging properties.\\nTo address the challenge of diversity quantification, we introduce tractable metrics that provide valuable insights into a model's ability to acquire and reproduce diverse behaviors. These metrics offer a practical means to assess the robustness and versatility of imitation learning algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art methods on the proposed task suite. This evaluation serves as a benchmark for assessing their capability to learn diverse behaviors. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of these methods in tackling the intricate problem of capturing and generalizing multi-modal human behaviors, offering a valuable reference for the design of future imitation learning algorithms.\",\"conference_abbreviation\":\"ICLR\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"000db903-ef33-53f8-a0ae-9835a5bc8e3b\",\"title\":\"NAVSIM: Data-Driven Non-Reactive Autonomous Vehicle Simulation and Benchmarking\",\"abstract\":\"Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

Out of the box, CLIP shows stellar zero-shot and few-shot capabilities on a wide range of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, which prior works attribute mainly to today's large and comprehensive training dataset (like LAION). However, it is questionable how meaningful terms like out-of-distribution generalization are for CLIP as it seems likely that web-scale datasets like LAION simply contain many samples that are similar to common OOD benchmarks originally designed for ImageNet. To test this hypothesis, we retrain CLIP on pruned LAION splits that replicate ImageNet\\u2019s train-test similarity with respect to common OOD benchmarks. While we observe a performance drop on some benchmarks, surprisingly, CLIP\\u2019s overall performance remains high. This shows that high train-test similarity is insufficient to explain CLIP\\u2019s OOD performance, and other properties of the training data must drive CLIP to learn more generalizable representations. Additionally, by pruning data points that are dissimilar to the OOD benchmarks, we uncover a 100M split of LAION (\\u00bc of its original size) on which CLIP can be trained to match its original OOD performance.\",\"conference_abbreviation\":\"ICLR\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"001ab93b-7665-5d56-a28e-eac95d2a9d7e\",\"title\":\"Masked Audio Text Encoders are Effective Multi-Modal Rescorers\",\"abstract\":\"Masked Language Models (MLMs) have proven to be effective for second-pass rescoring in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.

The important part to enable these applications is inverse design, which seeks to identify a suitable structure that satisfy desired optical responses.  Recently, a foundation model called OptoGPT is proposed and has shown great potential to solve a wide range of inverse design problems. However, OptoGPT fails to design certain types of optical responses that are important to practical applications. The major reason is that the training data is randomly sampled and it is possible these design targets are not selected in training, leading to the out-of-distribution issue. In this work, we propose a self-improving data augmentation technique by leveraging neural networks' extrapolation ability. Using this method, we show significant improvement in various real-applicative design tasks with minimum fine-tuning, which can also be potentially generalized to inverse scientific foundation models.\",\"conference_abbreviation\":\"NeurIPS\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"002ab291-ebd9-545e-9dcb-fe67164da2dc\",\"title\":\"MvP: Multi-view Prompting Improves Aspect Sentiment Tuple Prediction\",\"abstract\":\"Generative methods greatly promote aspect-based sentiment analysis via generating a sequence of sentiment elements in a specified format. However, existing studies usually predict sentiment elements in a fixed order, which ignores the effect of the interdependence of the elements in a sentiment tuple and the diversity of language expression on the results. In this work, we propose Multi-view Prompting (MVP) that aggregates sentiment elements generated in different orders, leveraging the intuition of human-like problem-solving processes from different views. Specifically, MVP introduces element order prompts to guide the language model to generate multiple sentiment tuples, each with a different element order, and then selects the most reasonable tuples by voting. MVP can naturally model multi-view and multi-task as permutations and combinations of elements, respectively, outperforming previous task-specific designed methods on multiple ABSA tasks with a single model. Extensive experiments show that MVP significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance on 10 datasets of 4 benchmark tasks, and performs quite effectively in low-resource settings.

To overcome this issue, we propose a Self-Training with Feedback (STF) framework that leverages the large-scale unlabeled data and acquires feedback for each new event prediction from the unlabeled data by comparing it to the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph of the same sentence. Specifically, STF consists of (1) a base event extraction model trained on existing event annotations and then applied to large-scale unlabeled corpora to predict new event mentions as pseudo training samples, and (2) a novel scoring model that takes in each new predicted event trigger, an argument, its argument role, as well as their paths in the AMR graph to estimate a compatibility score indicating the correctness of the pseudo label. The compatibility scores further act as feedback to encourage or discourage the model learning on the pseudo labels during self-training. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets, including ACE05-E, ACE05-E+, and ERE, demonstrate the effectiveness of the STF framework on event extraction, especially event argument extraction, with significant performance gain over the base event extraction models and strong baselines. Our experimental analysis further shows that STF is a generic framework as it can be applied to improve most, if not all, event extraction models by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data, even when high-quality AMR graph annotations are not available.\",\"conference_abbreviation\":\"ACL\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"003b812e-8743-50e7-b69a-08d7a8402d1b\",\"title\":\"DeMo: Decoupling Motion Forecasting into  Directional Intentions and Dynamic States\",\"abstract\":\"Accurate motion forecasting for traffic agents is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments. Mainstream methods adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-modal trajectories. While straightforward and effective, the absence of detailed representation of future trajectories may yield suboptimal outcomes, given that the agent states dynamically evolve over time. To address this problem, we introduce DeMo, a framework that decouples multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries capturing distinct directional intentions and state queries tracking the agent's dynamic states over time. By leveraging this format, we separately optimize the multi-modality and dynamic evolutionary properties of trajectories. Subsequently, the mode and state queries are integrated to obtain a comprehensive and detailed representation of the trajectories. To achieve these operations, we additionally introduce combined Attention and Mamba techniques for global information aggregation and state sequence modeling, leveraging their respective strengths. Extensive experiments on both the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that our DeMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion forecasting.
