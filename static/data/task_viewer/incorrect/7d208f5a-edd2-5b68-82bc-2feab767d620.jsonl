{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"page_content\":\"is not involved in encoding, more distortions are intruduced\\nand make it difficult for the Adaptor to learn an adaptive nu-\\nmerical ES. To further enhance the performance of our net-\\nwork, we propose an improved ES Matrix Adaptor, which\\ncontains more learnable parameters to assign a specific ES to\\neach pixel for a better trade-off between robustness and im-\\nperceptibility.\\nDifferent from [12] adapting the container image texture,\\nour deep template is fed directly into our ES Matrix Adaptor\\nin order to guarantee the independence of the ES Matrix from\\nthe host image. The Adaptor is independent of Encoder and\\nDecoder and is aimed at increasing the network fit to output\\nthe universal ES matrix. Specifically, we utilize a Dense-Net\\nwith three Dense Blocks to extract the feature of the template,\\nwhich is then fed into an Output Layer to be converted into a\\ntemplate-sized ES Matrix Mes. For the templates, multipli-\\ncation with Mes only changes its intensity as traditional ES\\ndoes. Our Mes retains generality and does not modify the\\ntemplate itself, which is why we consider it as an independent\\noptimization of the numerical ES, rather than an intermediate\\nlayer parameter of the network.\\nOverflow Sensitivity Training. In the additive embed-\\nding process, it is a common problem that information is lost\\ndue to the modification of the host by the general template\\nthat overflows the pixel value range. To address this prob-\\nlem, we propose an overflow sensitivity training method to\\nhelp the Decoder to be more sensitive when facing edge range\\npixel value. The purpose of our design is that when decoding\\npixel values in the edge range, the feature extraction is only\\nrelated to the template amplitude and has nothing to do with\\nthe positivity. Specifically, our approach is to add conditions\\nto the additive operations. If the pixel value after superposi-\\ntion overflows, the addition operation of the pixel is converted\\ninto a subtraction operation, which can be formulated as:\\nIcontainer =\\n(\\nIhost \\u2212Iadditive,\\noverflow\\nIhost + Iadditive,\\notherwise\\n(1)\\nwhere\\nIadditive = Itemplate \\u00b7 Mes\\n(2)\\nDecoder. Like the Encoder, a U-Net is used in the De-\\ncoder to extract features from the container image. The con-\\ntainer image with overflow sensitivity additive operation is\\nfed into the Decoder to obtain the feature, which is then trans-\\nformed by an Output Layer to recover the one-dimensional\\nrecovered message S\\u2032.\\nLoss Function. There are three loss items during training.\\nHiding loss LH with the MSE loss aims to improve the visual\\nquality of our network. The common discrimination loss is\\nnot used. This is because in the experiments, the addition of\\nthe discriminator did not improve the visual quality. Through\\nanalysis, we believe that the generality of our template makes\\nthe discriminator hard to reduce its loss. The Recover loss\\nLR measures the Binary Cross Entropy between S and S\\u2032.\\nWe omit the details of them as they are all commonly used.\\nThe third item is pixel-change loss LP , which is spe-\\ncially designed to standardize the generation of the templates.\\nFor IS is obtained by S through redundant replication, the\\nEncoder\\u2019s input images mainly have low-frequency content,\\nwhich makes it difficult for the Encoder to generate high-\\nfrequency property templates with higher visual quality. In\\nour early experiments, we introduced the Canny operator\\nresponse as the loss. However, the Canny operator cannot\\ncapture the edge with the low template amplitude. Then we\\nchoose to limit pixel value changes to achieve this purpose.\\nSpecifically, we limit the changes between each pixel of tem-\\nplates with its neighbors to obtain high-frequency property\\nand smooth-brightness templates.\\nThe training loss is the weighted sum of them, and more\\ndetails as follows:\\nLH = MSE(Icontainer, Ihost)\\n(3)\\nLR = BCE(S, S\\u2032)\\n(4)\\nLP =\\n1\\n9M \\u00d7 N\\nv\\nu\\nu\\nt\\nM\\nX\\ni=1\\nN\\nX\\nj=1\\n1\\nX\\n\\u03b4x=\\u22121\\n1\\nX\\n\\u03b4y=\\u22121\\n(Pi,j \\u2212Pi+\\u03b4x,j+\\u03b4y)2\\n(5)\\nL = \\u03bb1 \\u2217LH + \\u03bb2 \\u2217LR + \\u03bb3 \\u2217LP\\n(6)\\nwhere P is the pixel value and M, N is the image size. \\u03bb1, \\u03bb2,\\n\\u03bb3 are weight factors, we set them to 1, 10 and 3 by default.\\n4. EXPERIMENTS\\nWe randomly select 10,000 images of size 128 \\u00d7 128 from\\nCOCO dataset to train our model, and validate it with COCO\\nvalidation set.\\nEach message S is composed of random\\n0s and 1s of length 64.\\nFor the noise layer, we com-\\nbine Identity, JPEG(Q=50), Gaussian Filter(7\\u00d77), Gaussian\\nNoise(\\u03c3=0.01), Median Filtering(7\\u00d77), Salt Pepper(p=0.1)\\nand Dropout(p=0.3) from [10], and randomly select one\\ntype for each batch. In addition, in order to obtain physical\\nshooting resistance, after the random noise above we add the\\nPIMoG [11] noise, which combines Perspective Transforma-\\ntion, Illumination Distortion, Moire and Gaussian Noise to\\nsimulate shooting process.\\nTo measure the visual quality, we utilize the PSNR(dB)\\nand SSIM as the evaluation metrics.

Visual Quality and Robustness With Comparison\\nWe show our robustness and visual quality experimental\\nresults in this section.\\nAs shown in Fig.2, even without\\nthe involvement of the host image texture, our templated-\\nbased method maintains a high visual quality with PSNR =\\n40.04, SSIM = 0.9916.
