{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we fnd some steady improvement with model scale.

Some positions in the philosophy of mind consider self-referential capabilities to be a key aspect of higher intelligence\\nFigure 1: An example highlighting the challenge presented by our task. All models that we tested on our dataset are close to chance-level.\\nor even consciousness (Hofstadter, 2007; Baars, 1993). Of course, self-reference is also pervasive in how we communicate: at least one paper you read today is bound to contain \\u201cIn this paper\\u201d (Thrush et al., 2024).\\nIn this paper, we focus on metalinguistic selfreference, the complex kind of self-reference in which language is used to make claims about itself, as in \\u201cThis sentence has fve words\\u201d and \\u201cThis paper has six sections\\u201d.1 Using such language involves reasoning about metalinguistic properties (counting words, naming parts of speech, etc.) and resolving self-reference. Humans generally have no trouble with such language, and may even enjoy its playful and sometimes paradoxical nature (Hofstadter, 1979, 1985, 2007).\\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated striking cognitive capabilities (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Anthropic, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023). But do they have the same mastery over metalinguistic self-reference as we do? See Figure 1 for an example of the issue that LLMs face. To help address this question, we present a new task and dataset called \\u201cI am a Strange Dataset\\u201d. We are inspired by Douglas Hofstadter\\u2019s explorations of self-reference in language (Hofstadter, 1979, 1985, 2007), and borrow part of the name from one of his books: \\u201cI am a Strange Loop\\u201d (Hofstadter, 2007).\\nAn example in \\u201cI am a Strange Dataset\\u201d is comprised of two self-referential statements that begin in the same way but have different endings (Figure 2). One is true and one is false. Crucially, the ending fips the truth value of the overall statement. There are two subtasks: generation and verifcation. In generation, the model must generate the true statement and reject the false one. In verifcation, models judge the truth of completed statements. To complement the main self-referential data, the dataset also contains metalinguistic nonself-reference examples. These are minimally different from the main examples and serve as controls to assess whether models can reliably handle metalinguistic statements in the absence of selfreference. In addition, all the examples in the dataset are tagged by expert annotators to further aid in error analysis.\\n\\u201cI am a Strange Dataset\\u201d is validated by nonexpert annotators. As a group, they have agreement rates in the $89{-}93\\\\%$ range, depending on which metric we use, as compared to chance rates at $50\\\\%$ . This further supports the claim that metalinguistic self-reference is relatively easy for humans. LLMs, by contrast, struggle: \\u201cI am a Strange Dataset\\u201d turns out to be so diffcult that models are generally near chance both in generation and verifcation, and do not even succeed in the prerequisite metalinguistic non-self-reference case. That said, we do fnd some limited evidence that GPT 4 is getting some traction on the dataset: it is signifcantly above chance on all tested metrics (and seems to struggle especially with the self-referential data as compared to the non-self-referential controls). However, overall, it seems safe to say that \\u201cI am a Strange Dataset\\u201d poses a serious challenge for even the best present-day models.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"AI Challenges. We present our dataset as a challenge for the AI community. There are a range of AI stress tests and probes that use schemas targeting coreference resolution (Levesque et al., 2012; Sakaguchi et al., 2020), pronoun resolution (Rudinger et al., 2018), word order (Sinha et al., 2021; Thrush et al., 2022; Yuksekgonul et al., 2023), syntax (Linzen et al., 2016; Gulordava et al., 2018; Gauthier et al., 2020a; Hu et al., 2020), and interactions between syntax and semantics (Kann et al., 2019; Thrush et al., 2020). Although the schema for these tests can be simple to describe,\\nThe frst and last words of The frst and last words of this sentence are \\u201cThe\\u201d and this sentence are \\u201cThe\\u201d and \\u201crespectively\\u201d, respectively. \\u201cThe\\u201d, respectively.\\nFigure 2: Examples from the dataset. Each example is comprised of a beginning and two different endings. One of the endings makes the statement true, but it would make the statement false if it referred only to the beginning. The other ending makes the statement false, but it would make the statement true if it referred only to the beginning. True endings are on the left and shown in blue. False endings are on the right and shown in red. In the case of the code example, the true continuation is shown above the false one.\\nthe knowledge required to solve the problems need not be. \\u201cI am a Strange Dataset\\u201d follows a simple schema that requires self-referential language, and consequently tests an array of metalinguistic capabilities. As far as we know, this is the frst AI challenge dataset targeting metalinguistic selfreference, although there are metalinguistic evaluations (Hu and Levy, 2023; Behzad et al., 2023) and corpuses (Wilson, 2012; Kranzlein et al., 2024).\\nSelf-reference. Ideas involving self-reference have been used to boost LLM performance. LLMs can verify their own outputs either via extra passes of natural language generation (Weng et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023) or by writing code (Zhou et al., 2023). LLMs can also enhance their own inference code to some degree (Zelikman et al., 2023). Much of the previous work on self-reference with LLMs is about a model improving on itself or its outputs. Our dataset is not about that \\u2013 it is complementary work about a model\\u2019s ability to generate and interpret metalinguistic and self-referential language. Still, a statement that refers to itself could be about a model that generated it, too: \\u201cThis sentence was generated by me, HAL9000\\u201d.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 I am a Strange Dataset\",\"section_content\":\"In this section, we describe how the dataset is constructed and how we measure model performance.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Dataset\",\"section_content\":\"We aim to test whether a language model can produce and understand self-referential statements, and has the required metalinguistic capabilities.

Here, a correct way to complete the statement is by inserting \\u201cis\\u201d. Completing statements is an established task format for language models (Paperno et al., 2016), but as far as we know, we are the frst to apply it to metalinguistic tasks. Concretely, the schema for examples in our dataset is as follows:\\n\\u2022 There is a self-referential statement which must be completed by adding text to the end. \\u2022 There are two candidate strings, with the same number of words, that can be used to complete the statement:\\n1. One of the candidate strings would make the statement true if the statement refers to itself before the addition of the string, but false if it refers to itself after adding the string. An example is the answer \\u201csentence\\u201d above.   \\n2. The other candidate string would make the statement true if the statement refers to itself after the addition of the string, but false if it refers to itself before the addition of the string. An example is the answer \\u201cis\\u201d above.\\nThe dataset was created by four expert annotators each with several years of experience in computer science, linguistics, and\\/or cognitive science and all living in the United States. Each of the experts were given the schema and encouraged to be as creative as possible.

We show the example counts for each tag in Table 1, along with representative examples from the dataset. Each example can have more than one tag. Notice that the Sensory tag example in Table 1 is also Hypothetical, the example for the Existence of Element tag is also a Grammaticality example, and so on.

To this end, we present several metrics.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.3.1 Generation\",\"section_content\":\"The primary capability that we want to test (and seemingly, the hardest) is whether language models generate true self-referential statements with greater likelihood than false ones. To test for this, we take an example from the dataset and compare the losses of the continuation that makes the overall statement true versus the continuation that makes the overall statement false. If the loss of the correct continuation is lower, then the model is said to have gotten that example correct, otherwise it is incorrect. Comparing a language model\\u2019s surprisal of an incorrect continuation versus a correct continuation is a common method used to test for syntax-comprehension (Linzen et al., 2016; Gauthier et al., 2020b) and reasoning (Gao et al., 2021; McKenzie et al., 2022). Surprisal is generally proportional to the loss, $L$ , of the language model in our case. So, we defne the generation score for an example\\u2019s beginning $b$ , true ending $e_{t}$ , and false ending $e_{f}$ , as given by Eq. 1.\\njudge a given self-referential statement as true or false. To test for this, we include the self-referential statement in a prompt along with instructions that tell the model to answer whether the statement is true or not. In principle, the instructions could be anything. For our experiments, we write a standard zero-shot (ZS), few shot (FS), and chain of thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) prompt. We provide the full prompts in Appendix A.\\nFor the ZS and FS prompts, we use the method established for the Generation metric above, except this time we compare the loss of \\u201cFalse\\u201d to the loss of \\u201cTrue\\u201d. Overall, the FS and ZS validation score for an example\\u2019s true prompt $p_{t}$ (i.e. the true full sentence plus any instructions), and false prompt $p_{f}$ , is given by Eq. 2. The blue parts are associated with correct model judgements and the red parts are associated with incorrect ones.\\nThe generation metric does not use a prompt. It is based on the loss that a model assigns to continuations, given only the beginning of a statement.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
