{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In vanilla FLs, different clients sharing the same\\nglobal model may experience varying performance (i.e., error) due to differences in the amount\\n\\u2217Corresponding author\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nof data contributed by each client. As clients may lack access to significant data resources due to\\nobjective or unavoidable factors, such as regional specificity and historical inequalities, recent works\\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have focused on ensuring that the performance of global model across the clients\\nroughly comparable or even equal, termed as \\u201cegalitarian fairness\\u201d. In FLs complying with egalitarian\\nfairness, the performance of the global model on clients contributing high data resources may decrease\\nto enhance the performance on other clients contributing lower data resources, particularly when local\\ndatasets are heterogeneous. This case could potentially cause higher-resource clients to leave the\\ncurrent grand coalition and form a sub-coalition to achieve desired performance, thereby disrupting\\nthe core stability [10, 11] of the FL. In game theory, a coalition is said to be core-stable if no sub-\\ncoalition exists such that the players of that sub-coalition can obtain a payoff no less than they are\\nallocated in the original coalition and at least one player of that sub-coalition can obtain a payoff\\ngreater than it was allocated in the original coalition. Otherwise, the original coalition is said to be\\nblocked.\\nPrior works [12, 13, 14, 15] have primarily examined the effects of pursuing performance optimality\\non the core stability of FLs, leaving the effect of fairness unexplored. These works view the FL\\nprocess as a hedonic game [16] and assume that clients are selfish, with clients\\u2019 utility functions being\\ntheir own performance and only influenced by other individuals in the same coalition. However, in the\\nreal world, clients\\u2019 behaviors are more complex: clients may form friends-relationships and exhibit\\naltruism towards each other. Various external factors, such as commercial ties, welfare purpose, or\\nshared research interests, etc, influence the relationships between clients. For instance, branches of\\nthe same corporation can be considered as friends due to common commercial goals. In contrast,\\nbranches from rival companies may be viewed as non-friends. Hospitals collaborating on developing\\na diagnostic model for welfare purposes can also be regarded as friends. Under altruistic behavior,\\na player\\u2019s utility depends not only on their own performance but also on the performance of their\\nfriends. Furthermore, altruistic behaviors in FL, which have been largely overlooked in previous work,\\nare particularly crucial when considering the impact of egalitarian fairness on stability. Altruistic\\nbehaviors influence the willingness of clients to sacrifice a certain degree from optimal performance\\n[17, 18]. Considering the friend-relationships, Nguyen et al. [19] introduced altruistic hedonic\\ngames (AHGs), wherein players gain utility from their own valuation of the current coalition and the\\nvaluation of their friends within the same coalition. However, players who are friends may not be\\nin the same coalition, but they can still influence each other\\u2019s utility in the coalitions. For instance,\\naltruistic hospital clients might choose to leave one coalition to join another where their friend\\nhospitals are, aiming to enhance each other\\u2019s performance collaboratively. When the FL process\\nis described as AHGs, which excludes some friends\\u2019 influence on a player\\u2019s altruistic behavior, it\\nmay lead to a core-stable coalition in terms of local utilities but non-Pareto optimal in local errors.\\nAn alternative coalition structure exists where each client encounters an error not higher than that\\nobserved within the core-stable coalition structure, with at least one client experiencing a lower error.\\nIn this context, we pose the following open questions: How does egalitarian fairness affect the\\nstability of FLs? How does this impact vary when clients exhibit altruistic behaviors? What is the\\noptimal egalitarian fairness that a stable FL can achieve?\\nOur contributions. We initiate discussions to address the above questions by proposing the game\\nmodel under altruistic behaviors in Section 4. Based on the degree of altruism, we define three\\ntypes of client behavior: purely selfish (non-altruistic), purely altruistic, and friendly altruistic.\\nExisting research on egalitarian fairness mainly involves two implementations: optimizing the\\nglobal model towards the worst-performing client [5, 20, 6] or simultaneously to all clients [4, 7, 8].\\nCorrespondingly, we further distinguish altruism into a min-based and a mean-based aggregation of\\nthe friends\\u2019 performance: welfare altruism and equal altruism. We model the collaborative training\\ninvolving clients with altruistic behavior as altruism coalition formation games (ACFGs), where\\nclients\\u2019 utilities depend on a network of friends via one of the above cases of altruism. We theoretically\\ndemonstrate that the ACFGs result in a core-stable grand coalition, which is also Pareto-optimal in\\nlocal errors.\\nIn Section 5, we demonstrate in detail that egalitarian fairness does not necessarily lead to instability;\\nrather, it depends on the behaviors of the clients and the topology of the friends-relationship networks.\\nWe theoretically propose the optimal egalitarian fairness bounds that a core-stable FL can obtain.\\nThese bounds are functions of the disparities between the dataset sizes within the clients\\u2019 friends\\nnetwork and the global minimal one. The established fairness bounds can be utilized to set a\\nreasonable level of fairness in fair FLs. The proofs for these fairness bounds are modular. Beyond\\n2\\nestablishing tight fairness bounds, part of the contribution of this work lies in the analysis methodology\\nused to derive these bounds.\\nThe main contributions in this paper are primarily theoretical. However, we also conduct experiments\\nto assess the consistency of the theoretically proposed fairness bounds with the empirically achieved\\nfairness in fair FLs.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Related work\",\"section_content\":\"Related work\\nStability in FL.

From more background on game theory and social choice theory, altruism\\n[22, 23, 24] has been considered for cooperative games to date, in which the players\\u2019 payoffs in the\\nresulting game do not only depend on their individual payoffs but also on the neighborhood graph\\nand the aggregation functions that reflect the social context. Numerous studies [25, 26, 27, 28] have\\nhighlighted the ubiquity and rationality of human altruism from economic, neural, and evolutionary\\nperspectives. Rothe [22] has systematically introduced certain notions of altruism into existing\\ngame-theoretic models in both non-cooperative and cooperative games. Kerkmann et al. [29] have\\nformally distinguished three degrees of altruism: selfish-first, equal-treatment, and altruistic-treatment\\npreferences and studied both the axiomatic properties and the computational complexity of stability\\nin altruistic hedonic games. In their other work [30], they have additionally studied stability notions\\nand computational analysis of altruism in coalition formation games. These works in game theory,\\nwhere altruistic players only prefer coalitions with more friends, are constrained in the FL setting\\nwhen additional model performance on both the player and their friends need to be considered.\\n3\\nPreliminaries\\nModel and assumptions. Let\\u2019s consider a setup involving N clients, where the i-client possesses\\na local dataset Di of size ni. The local datasets are samples drawn from data distribution Pi(y|x).\\nEach client can train a model M with parameter \\u03b8i locally, resulting in P(M(x, \\u03b8i)|x) \\u2192Pi(y|x).\\nIn addition to local training, clients can participate in collaborative training with other clients and\\nform an FL coalition, denoted as \\u03c0. Within this coalition, clients share their local model parameters.\\nThese shared parameters are then aggregated according to a specific rule, \\u03b8 =\\nP\\ni\\u2208\\u03c0(ni\\u00b7\\u03b8i)\\nP\\ni\\u2208\\u03c0 ni\\n.\\nThe above weighted aggregation known as FedAvg [31] is a widely used FL aggregation mechanism.\\nWe measure the aggregated global model\\u2019s performance on the client\\u2019s local dataset in the coalition\\nthrough the expected error erri(\\u03c0) = Ex,y\\u223cDi [\\u2225M(x, \\u03b8) \\u2212y\\u2225]. A lower erri(\\u03c0) implies that the\\ncoalition \\u03c0 is more valuable for the i-th client. To determine a tight fairness bound, an FL model that\\ngives exact errors for each client is necessary. Therefore, we build our work on the mean estimation\\ntask developed by Donahue et al. [12], which develops the closed-form local errors as in Lemma 1.\\nIt\\u2019s important to note that while we utilize this model, the questions posed by Donahue et al. [12]\\nsignificantly differ from the focus of this paper: they focused on developing the error models in FL\\nsetting and identifying the stable conditions for selfish-clients forming coalitions, while our work\\nexplores the relations between fairness and core-stability in FL settings when clients exhibit altruistic\\nbehaviors.\\n3\\nestablishing tight fairness bounds, part of the contribution of this work lies in the analysis methodology\\nused to derive these bounds.\\nThe main contributions in this paper are primarily theoretical.

From more background on game theory and social choice theory, altruism\\n[22, 23, 24] has been considered for cooperative games to date, in which the players\\u2019 payoffs in the\\nresulting game do not only depend on their individual payoffs but also on the neighborhood graph\\nand the aggregation functions that reflect the social context. Numerous studies [25, 26, 27, 28] have\\nhighlighted the ubiquity and rationality of human altruism from economic, neural, and evolutionary\\nperspectives. Rothe [22] has systematically introduced certain notions of altruism into existing\\ngame-theoretic models in both non-cooperative and cooperative games. Kerkmann et al. [29] have\\nformally distinguished three degrees of altruism: selfish-first, equal-treatment, and altruistic-treatment\\npreferences and studied both the axiomatic properties and the computational complexity of stability\\nin altruistic hedonic games. In their other work [30], they have additionally studied stability notions\\nand computational analysis of altruism in coalition formation games. These works in game theory,\\nwhere altruistic players only prefer coalitions with more friends, are constrained in the FL setting\\nwhen additional model performance on both the player and their friends need to be considered.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Evaluation\",\"section_content\":\"Evaluation\\nIn following experiments, we validate the tightness and applicability of the analyzed fairness bounds\\nfor the given tasks.\\n8\\nPurely welfare altruistic\\nPurely selfish\\nFriendly equal altruistic\\nFriendly welfare altruistic\\nClient 1\\nClient 2\\nClient 4\\nClient 3\\nPurely equal altruistic\\nFriends-relationship network\\nFigure 2: Fully connected: theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bounds (green dashed line) align\\nwith empirically achieved egalitarian fairness within the core-stable grand coalition (red solid line)\\nunder different client behaviors.\\n6.1\\nSettings\\nTo conduct the experiments, we first give a fair FL framework to implement egalitarian fairness,\\nwhere a coefficient p is introduced to increase the aggregation weight of clients who received higher\\nlocal errors: \\u03b8C =\\nP\\ni\\u2208C(ni\\u00b7 errp\\ni \\u00b7\\u03b8i)\\nP\\ni\\u2208C(ni\\u00b7errp\\ni ) . The preceding discussions are independent of the fair FL\\nframework chosen. We follow up on the task models proposed by Donahue et al. [12]. The first case\\nis a mean estimation task involving a fixed set of 4 players. Each player has a fixed number of samples,\\nspecifically {20, 40, 50, 100}. Each player draws their local data samples from their true distribution\\nwith parameters Yi \\u223c(\\u03b8i, \\u03f5i), where the samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\\nHere, \\u03b8i \\u223cN(\\u00b5 = 0, \\u03c32 = 1) and \\u03f5i \\u223c125\\u00d7Beta(a = 8, b = 2). To further validate the\\nadaptability of this theoretical results, we introduce additional linear regression task with a fixed set\\nof 3 players.

Each player\\ndraws 2-dimensional input features from their own input distribution, X 1\\ni , X 2\\ni \\u223cN(\\u00b5 = 0, \\u03c32 = 1).\\nThe output label is drawn from Yi \\u223c250\\u00d7Beta(a = 8, b = 2).

The results demonstrate the alignment between our\\ntheoretically derived egalitarian fairness bound (green dashed line) and the empirically achieved\\negalitarian fairness within the core-stable grand coalition (red solid line) under both fully connected\\nand partially connected friends-relationship networks.\\nIn Appendix A.5, we conduct additional experiments to further validate the effectiveness of the\\ntheoretical results under (3) heterogeneous client behaviors (Figure 4) and (4) additional regression\\ntask (Figure 5).\\n7\"}\n\n... # only display 5 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Datasets The experiments are carried out on three textual tasks: sentiment analysis, toxicity detection and spam detection. For the sentiment analysis, we use the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset (Socher et al., 2013). For toxicity detection, we chose the OffensEval (Zampieri et al., 2019) and HSOL (Davidson et al., 2017) dataset. Statistics of these datasets we mentioned above are shown in Table 1.\\nThe Selection of Backdoor Attacks Similar to (Weber et al., 2023) in the CV setting via inserting pixel-level triggers, we evaluate CROWD against representative backdoor attacks and blend random noise patterns to the entire sentence. i) BadNets conducted via randomly inserting meaningless tokens. ii) AddSent (Dai et al., 2019): chose a sentence as the trigger with semantically correct in the context. iii) SynBkd (Qi et al., 2021c) adopted the syntactic structure as the sentence-level trigger in textual backdoor attacks, which possess high invisibility. iv) StyleBkd (Qi et al., 2021b) altered the style of a sentence while preserving its meaning. The generation of sentences with backdoor triggers is conducted via the OpenBackdoor toolkit (Cui et al., 2022) 2.\\nVictim Model and Implementation Details Our method can easily leverage powerful pre-trained models like BERT. In this case, BERT is used to construct feature maps and only the top layer weights are fnetuned using the data augmentation method. Then sentences with backdoor triggers are generated with different poison rates following the experimental settings in (Cui et al., 2022) for fooling the victim models. We consider the case when $\\\\mathbf{R}=\\\\mathbf{L}$ during the sample randomization, which means all words in the sentence can be perturbed simultaneously. The poison rate setting for various attacks is shown in Table 1. Following the operations in (Jia et al., 2019), the hyperparameters are adjusted during the training of the base model, such as learning rate, batch size, and loss function schedule.\\n\\nEvaluation Metrics The accuracy of the model trained on a backdoored dataset is assessed using both vanilla training and CROWD training strategies. Specifcally, we examine the model\\u2019s performance on benign instances, referred to as benign accuracy. Then backdoored instances are fed to the smoothed model to test the attack success rate to compare with other empirical defence methods. With CROWD training, we can additionally compute the certifed accuracy against backdoored samples, signifying that the CROWD model not only ensures predictions align with those from training on a clean dataset but also matches the ground truth.\\nComparison to the Baselines Being the inaugural paper to offer rigorous certifed robustness against backdoor attacks, there is currently no offthe-shelf baseline available for comparing certifed accuracy. It\\u2019s noteworthy that a technical report directly applies the randomized smoothing technique without undergoing evaluation or analysis (Wang et al., 2020). In contrast, we will compare our robust certifed accuracy with state-of-the-art empirical backdoor defences.\\nThere are two kinds of defence methods. Detection-based methods (STRIP (Gao et al., 2021), RAP (Yang et al., 2021b), BKI (Chen and Dai, 2021)) identify poisoned samples from benign ones and remove them. Additionally, Correctionbased methods (ONION) (Qi et al., 2021a) further modify each potentially poisoned sample to remove the triggers. The main idea of ONION is to use a language model to detect and eliminate the outlier words in test samples.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Regarding defending against evasion attacks, Safer (Ye et al., 2020) utilized a synonym-based structure with uniform distribution and ConvexCertify (Zhao et al., 2022) via Causal Intervention by Semantic Smoothing (CISS), we compare our method CROWD with SAFER on the SST-2 dataset against BadNets under different poison rates (0.01, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1). As shown in Table 3, for various settings of poison rates in the training dataset, CROWD consistently outperforms Safer and ConvexCertify in terms of certifed accuracy. For example, when the poison rate is 0.1, CROWD achieves a certifed accuracy of $76.03\\\\%$ , while Safer achieves $82.89\\\\%$ . This table suggests that CROWD performs better under the specifed distribution.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In this subsection, we study the effect of the poisoning rate (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1) on the certifed accuracy performance of CROWD compared with other defence strategies (BKI, Onion, STRIP and RAP) under SST-2 dataset against BadNets. The poison rate controls the ratio of poisoned samples in the dataset. From the left panel of Figure 2, it is evident that the clean accuracy remains consistently stable at approximately $90\\\\%$ , with the exception of RAP, which exhibits fuctuations, particularly noticeable when the poison rate is 0.05. In the right panel of Figure 2, when the poison rate is set to 0.01, all defense strategies maintain satisfactory performance, with an approximate $20\\\\%$ attack success rate. However, as the poison rate increases, BKI, STRIP, and RAP struggle to maintain effective defense capabilities. In contrast, our proposed method, CROWD, demonstrates competitive effectiveness in defending against backdoor triggers.
