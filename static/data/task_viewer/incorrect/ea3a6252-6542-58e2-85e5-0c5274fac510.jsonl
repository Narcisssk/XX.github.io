{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "[Question]: Out of the four baselines used by the paper that proposes MEQE method, which one is also utilized as a baseline by the other three papers? Additionally, what are the two other baselines that the three papers have in common?\n[Answer Format]: Your answer should be a Python list with two elements. The first element should be the full name of the baseline shared by all four papers (the anchor PDF method and the three other baselines). The second element should be a Python list containing the full names of the two additional baselines shared by the three papers.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term. The detailed\\nresults are presented in Figure 9.\\nOur findings reveal that increasing the number of diffusion steps primarily enhances behavior en-\\ntropy, signifying an improvement in the model\\u2019s capacity to capture multi-modalities. However,\\nfor BeT and VAE-ACT, we did not observe a consistent trend indicating a correlation between the\\nparameters and success rate or entropy.\\nInference Time Comparison.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities. MVP (transfer) trained with simple tasks (TASD and ASTE here) with adequate data can be easily transferred to tough tasks (ASQP and ACOS here) when the dataset sizes are small, and vice versa.\\nTable 4: Ablation of constrained decoding and effect of aggregation strategy on ASTE (L14) and ASQP (R15). \\u201cw\\/o cd\\u201d discards the constrained decoding during inference.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term. The detailed\\nresults are presented in Figure 9.\\nOur findings reveal that increasing the number of diffusion steps primarily enhances behavior en-\\ntropy, signifying an improvement in the model\\u2019s capacity to capture multi-modalities. However,\\nfor BeT and VAE-ACT, we did not observe a consistent trend indicating a correlation between the\\nparameters and success rate or entropy.\\nInference Time Comparison.

The algo-\\nrithms differ in whether they use history information (MLP back-\\nbones for no history, Transformer\\/GPT backbones for history-\\nbased models), whether they predict future action sequences (sin-\\ngle actions\\/SA or action chunking\\/AC, Transformer-Encoder-\\nDecoder\\/T-EncDec backbones for AC) and how they model di-\\nverse behavior (last column).\\nWe benchmark a large set of\\nrecent imitation learning algo-\\nrithms.\\nThese algorithms can\\nbe categorized along three axes.\\nThe first axis specifies whether\\nthe algorithms are using a his-\\ntory of state observations. For\\nalgorithms that do not use his-\\ntory (Sohn et al., 2015; Flo-\\nrence et al., 2022), a standard\\nMLP is used as backbone ar-\\nchitecture,\\nwhile for history-\\ndependent policies (Shafiullah\\net\\nal.,\\n2022;\\nPearce\\net\\nal.,\\n2023; Reuss et al., 2023; Chi\\net al., 2023) we use a causal\\nmasked Transformer Decoder\\n(GPT) based on the implemen-\\ntation of BeT (Shafiullah et al.,\\n2022) as backbone as this archi-\\ntecture has been also adopted by other recent approaches. In our experiments, we use a history of\\nk = 5. The second axis categorizes whether the algorithms are predicting only a single action or the\\nfuture action sequence (Zhao et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023), which has been recently introduced as\\n5\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\naction chunking which has been shown to improve performance in some tasks. For action chunking\\nmodels, we use a Transformer Encoder Decoder structure (T-EncDec) (Vaswani et al., 2017) based\\non the implementation of VAE-ACT (Zhao et al., 2023). The third axis categorizes how the algo-\\nrithms capture behavior diversity. Standard deterministic models are not able to do so, while more\\nrecent models use clustering (Shafiullah et al., 2022), VAEs (Zhao et al., 2023; Sohn et al., 2015),\\nimplicit models (Florence et al., 2022) as well as discrete-time (Pearce et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023),\\nor continuous time diffusion models (Reuss et al., 2023). To improve our understanding of the in-\\nfluence of the specific design choices, we also evaluate new variants of these combinations such as\\nhistory-free (MLP-based) action clustering (BeT-MLP). The full table of used algorithmic setups is\\ndepicted in Table 2. A more detailed description of all model architectures is given in Appendix C.\\n4.2\\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nWe briefly outline the most important aspects of our experimental setup.\\nEvaluation Protocol. To assess a model\\u2019s ability to capture diverse behavior, we propose the behav-\\nior entropy and the conditional behavior entropy (Section 3.1). For the former, we perform multiple\\nsimulations, from which we compute the model\\u2019s behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2). For the latter, we use\\na randomly sampled but fixed set of initial states s0 and perform multiple simulations for each s0\\nin order to compute the conditional behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0). Alongside the entropy, we also\\nreport the success rate which is the fraction of simulations that led to successful task completion.\\nState \\/ Observation Representation. For most experiments, we provide state representation and\\nimage observations. For the former, we use handcrafted features that work well empirically. For the\\nlatter, we used two different camera views, in-hand and front view with a 96 \\u00d7 96 image resolution.\\nWe follow Chi et al. (2023) and use a ResNet-18 architecture as an image encoder for all methods.\\nModel Selection. Model selection is challenging as the training objective does not coincide with\\ntask performance (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Paine et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021; Mandlekar et al., 2021).\\nMoreover, policy performance can exhibit substantial variations from one training epoch to another\\n(Mandlekar et al., 2021). For image-based experiments we evaluate the task performance frequently\\n(after every 1\\/10th of total training) and chose the model with the best task-performance. Due to\\nhigh-computational demand for simulation, we split the dataset into training (90%) and validation\\n(10%) and chose the model with the lowest validation loss for state-based experiments. We ensure\\nthat the training converges by using 500 epochs for state representation and 200 for image obser-\\nvations. We extensively tune the most important hyperparameters of all methods using Bayesian\\noptimization (Snoek et al., 2012). We report the mean and the standard deviation over six random\\nseeds for all experiments.\\n4.3\\nBENCHMARK USING STATE REPRESENTATION\\nWe present the results utilizing state representations in Table 3. Detailed information regarding\\nindividual state representations for the tasks can be found in Appendix A. Through an analysis of\\nthe performance and diversity across all methods, we outline our key findings below.\\nMultiple Strategies for Multi-Modal Behavior Learning. This section discusses various strate-\\ngies employed by different models for learning multi-modal behavior. Deterministic models like\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT have limitations in this regard since they can only generate a single solution\\ngiven an initial state s0. On the other hand, VAE-based models like VAE-State and VAE-ACT are\\ncapable of generating different behaviors, but they tend to exhibit low behavior entropy, presumably\\ndue to a phenomenon often referred to as \\u201dmode collapse\\u201d (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In contrast,\\nIBC, BeT, and diffusion-based models demonstrate the capacity to learn multi-modal distributions.\\nIBC, for instance, exhibits high diversity in tasks like Avoiding, Pushing, and Sorting-2, with en-\\ntropy levels slightly superior to DDPM-MLP. BeT is capable of learning diverse solutions for each\\ntask, but it comes with a significant performance drop when compared to the deterministic BC-GPT\\nbaseline. Notably, diffusion-based methods, especially those incorporating transformer backbones,\\nexcel in learning diverse behavior while maintaining strong performance across all tasks. To of-\\nfer additional insights, we include visual representations of the diverse solutions generated by each\\nmethod for the Avoiding task in Figure 10. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of hyper-\\nparameter sensitivity, which is discussed in Section B. This analysis provides a deeper understanding\\n6\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTable 3: Comparison between various Imitation Learning algorithms, some of which incorporate his-\\ntory (\\u2021), action chunking (\\u2020), or both using state representations (State Data) and image observations\\n(Visual Data).

Notably, our findings reveal\\nthat increasing the number of diffusion steps leads to a substantial enhancement in diversity while\\nmaintaining consistent task performance.\\nHistorical Inputs and Prediction Horizons are Important. A comparison of results between\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT, VAE-State and VAE-ACT, BeT-MLP and BeT, DDPM-MLP and DDPM-\\nGPT reveals a notable trend: transformer-based methods consistently outperform their MLP-based\\ncounterparts. In particular, DDPM-GPT achieves an average 21% improvement in success rate\\nacross Avoiding, Aligning, and Pushing tasks compared to DDPM-MLP. While DDPM-MLP ex-\\nhibits higher entropy on the Aligning task, it lags behind on other tasks. When comparing VAE-\\nMLP to VAE-ACT, VAE-ACT demonstrates a success rate improvement of over 30% on most tasks,\\nindicating its effectiveness in capturing diverse behaviors. More significantly, transformers that\\nincorporate historical inputs or prediction horizons demonstrate the ability to tackle challenging\\ntasks like Sorting-4 and Stacking. However, the combination of historical information with ex-\\ntended prediction horizons (DDPM-ACT) does not appear to provide substantial benefits compared\\nto DDPM-GPT, which does not predict future actions.\\nScaling to More Complex Tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods excel in tasks such as Avoid-\\ning, Aligning, and Pushing; however, a notable performance gap emerges in Sorting and Stacking\\ntasks. In the case of Sorting, scaling with an increasing number of objects proves challenging for\\nall methods. Specifically, on the Sorting-6 task, none of the existing methods achieve satisfactory\\nperformance. The complexity of the observation space and task diversity significantly increases as\\nwe aggregate all box features into a single state vector. Consequently, there is a demand for models\\ncapable of learning compact and resilient state representations.\\n4.4\\nBENCHMARK USING IMAGE OBSERVATIONS\\nWe present the results utilizing image observations in Table 3. Detailed information regarding cam-\\nera setup can be found in Appendix A. Through an analysis of the performance and diversity across\\nall methods, we outline our key findings below.\\nComparison between State-Based and Image-Based Policies. State representations have proven\\nhighly effective for tasks demanding precise control (i.e. Aligning), but they do not scale with the\\nnumber of objects (i.e. Sorting). In such case, state-based approaches may struggle to exploit in-\\nvariances, which are essential for handling complex scenarios. Conversely, image representations\\nexhibit a notable capacity to handle scenarios involving multiple objects. However, image-based\\npolicy performs much worse than state-based policy on the Aligning task, which require precise\\ncontrol. The inherent difficulty in extracting fine-grained details and spatial relationships from im-\\nages makes it challenging in achieving precise manipulation.\\nTrade-off in Sequential Information Across Visual Tasks. From the results of state-based evalua-\\ntions, it is evident that historical inpu ...\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
