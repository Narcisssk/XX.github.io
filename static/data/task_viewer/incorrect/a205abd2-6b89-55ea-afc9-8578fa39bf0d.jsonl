{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, most existing datasets are limited in size and number of emotion categories. They often focus on extracting parts of the document that contain the emotion cause and fail to provide more abstractive, generalizable root cause. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset of emotion causes, derived from 9.8 million cleaned tweets over 15 years. We describe our curation process, which includes a comprehensive pipeline for data gathering, cleaning, labeling, and validation, ensuring the dataset\\u2019s reliability and richness. We extract emotion labels and provide abstractive summarization of the events causing emotions. The fnal dataset comprises over 700,000 tweets with corresponding emotion-cause pairs spanning 48 emotion classes, validated by human evaluators. The novelty of our dataset stems from its broad spectrum of emotion classes and the abstractive emotion cause that facilitates the development of an emotion-cause knowledge graph for nuanced reasoning. Our dataset will enable the design of emotion-aware systems that account for the diverse emotional responses of different people for the same event.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Emotion-Cause analysis is gaining interest due to its potential impact on applications such as empathetic dialog systems and mental health support chats. It is more challenging than traditional emotion recognition in text because it requires a higher level of semantic understanding (Lee et al., 2010, Gui et al., 2016, Xia and Ding, 2019).\\nMost existing works (Gui et al., 2016; Bostan et al., 2020; Kim and Klinger, 2018) model emotion cause analysis as an extraction problem, resulting in datasets that provide only specifc, descriptive information on emotion causes and lack deeper, abstract causes. For example, in a tweet, a user expresses their emotion by stating, \\u201cI am often on\\nTweet: I'm home but it doesn't feel like it. And I'm angry because of it. I hate the feeling of being lonely . They are with me. But I feel empty Emotion: angry   \\nCause: feeling lonely and empty despite being home.   \\nTweet: If you're not making mistakes, you're not doing anything. I feel positive because I make mistakes and I can be better after that.   \\nEmotion: positive   \\nCause: overcoming mistakes and becoming a better person\\nFigure 1: Examples of data points in EMO-KNOW social because I feel very lonely in real life. My friends suck, my relatives suck even more and I have nobody in my life. Even my dog was taken away, so if you are wondering about how I am feeling? Yes, I am lonely.\\u201d The second sentence is typically annotated as the emotion\\u2019s cause in existing datasets, but this fails to highlight the more generalized root cause. This way of annotation, however, fails to highlight the more generalized root cause, which in this case is the lack of fulflling relationships in the person\\u2019s life. This level of abstraction is essential for comprehensive emotioncause understanding and reasoning.\\n\\nA further limitation of existing datasets lies in the coarse granularity of their emotion categories. Modern theories of emotion suggest that emotions are not simply reducible to a basic set of 6-8 emotion categories (Barrett, 2017, Cowen and Keltner, 2017). Therefore, labeling user\\u2019s emotions with a limited set of emotions will either miss out on many other emotions or forcefully label their emotions as something else. For this reason, a fner granularity of emotion categories would better refect the true diversity and nuance of human emotions. For instance, \\u2018pride\\u2019 and \\u2018gratitude\\u2019 both fall under the category of \\u2018joy,\\u2019 but each carries distinct nuances and potentially different causes.\\nWhile previous work by Zhan et al. (2022) has made progress in summarizing events that trigger emotions, is limited in scale and covers only seven emotions. To enable AI models to reason more diversely and discerningly about emotion-cause, a comprehensive knowledge base is required. However, manually annotating a large-scale dataset is expensive. In this work, we present EMO-KNOW, a validated dataset on emotion causes curated from 9.8 million tweets over 15 years. Our dataset contains tweets where users describe their emotions and triggering events, spanning 48 emotion types. Unlike other datasets that rely on outside labeling, ours uses the users\\u2019 own words, making it more genuine. With this data, combined with the emotion-cause details, we can create a map that shows how emotions are linked to causes, helping us understand the connections better. (Wang et al., 2021, Qian et al., 2023). Our contributions are a method to create a large-scale, high ecological validity emotion dataset, validation with automatic metrics and human evaluators, and open-sourcing the dataset1(700K datums) for researchers.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Annotated Emotion Cause Datasets. The feld of emotion analysis has seen a rise in interest recently, leading to the creation of several datasets that provide annotations for both emotion and its causes. (Zheng et al., 2022, Chen et al., 2020) For example, Lee et al. (2010) introduced a dataset of 5,964 entries with word-level annotations of emotion and emotion causes, covering 6 emotion classes. Gui et al. (2016) annotated 2,105 news articles with clauses that contain 6 emotion classes and emotion causes. For English corpora, Bostan et al. (2020) annotated a dataset of emotion, emotion cause and affect intensity, comprised of 5000 news headlines spanning 15 emotion classes. Kim and Klinger (2018) introduced a dataset of 1720 triplets of <emotion, emotion experiencer, emotion cause>. Diverging from the extractive approach, Zhan et al. (2022) developed a new dataset focusing on emotion and its triggers by summarizing the events that lead to particular emotions. This dataset has 1883 Reddit posts, annotated with emotions (7 classes) and abstractive summaries of their triggers. As manual annotation often involves the cost of human labor, most annotated datasets are limited in size, and limited in the number of emotion classes they contain.\\n\\nAutomatic Data Labeling: In an effort to circumvent the costs of manual annotation, researchers have devised ways to generate large-scale datasets using pre-existing models. For instance, Welivita et al. (2021) produced EDOS by fne-tuning RoBERTa on a small label set created through crowdsourcing, and then used it to label 1 million conversations in the Opensubtitles dataset (Lison et al., 2018). Similarly, Welivita and Pu (2022) created HEAL - a knowledge graph consisting of 1 million distress narratives, annotated for emotion, post summarization, and node clustering using a variety of pre-existing models. A prevalent shortcoming of emotion labeling with current models is their limited accuracy; the emotion classifers utilized in both HEAL and EDOS only achieved accuracies ranging from $65\\\\%$ to $65.88\\\\%$ . We address this limitation by harnessing users\\u2019 self-reported emotion labels and rigorously assessing the performance of our fne-tuned emotion-cause summarization model with human evaluators.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Methods\",\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Data Curation\",\"section_content\":\"Data was curated by scraping tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API over a period of 15 years, spanning from 2008 to 2022.

We used this list of 48 emotions to iteratively refne and expand our search space to obtain a set of 9.8 million data. We applied a data cleaning and refnement pipeline, which include removing expression of sympathy, profanity, and tweets with non-meaningful patterns.

Although exceptions exist, such as instances of negating statements within tweets, our error analysis found that most cases follow this rule. Thus, we simply extract the emotion label from the word that fts into our identifed pattern. This method ensures that the emotion label accurately refects the individual\\u2019s true feelings, unlike traditional methods where emotion labels are determined by human annotators, which can introduce biases.\\nAfter obtaining the emotion label, we proceed to extract the cause of the emotion. We approach this task by treating it as a question-answer challenge. Given a tweet and an emotion label $e$ , we train a language model to answer the question: Why do I feel $e?$ At frst glance, this task appears simple, especially considering tweets are usually short. Therefore, one might expect traditional Q&A models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to perform well. However, most Q&A models are designed to answer questions in an extractive way, which prevents them from providing abstractive, generalized answers about emotion causes.\\n\\nGiven these limitations of extraction-based models in identifying emotion causes, an alternative approach would be to frame the problem as a generative question-answering problem. This method, however, requires additional training data for pretrained models. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) have shown impressive abilities in following instructions and performing tasks like summarization.\\nLLMs have been trained on a vast amount of text and have often demonstrated a remarkable ability to generalize. Previous studies, like those by Bosselut et al. (2019) have used LLMs to generate abstractive common-sense knowledge relations. These models have also been used to generate pseudolabels for training smaller models on more specialized tasks, as noted in studies by Ye et al. (2022) and (Taori et al., 2023). This method is very economical. It eliminates the need for human annotators while utilizing freely available pre-trained language models without incurring the full cost of labeling millions of tweets with GPTs. Using this approach, we experimented with various prompts before settling on the following prompt to obtain the emotion and cause labels from InstructGPT: \\\"Answer the following questions: 1. What is the emotion expressed in the text? 2. What is the cause of such emotion? Provide the answer in the following format strictly: 1. E where E is the emotion from this list: [list of 48 emotions], 2. $C$ where C is the summary of the cause in 10 words. Use NA for $E$ when there is no emotion, and use NA for $C$ when there is no cause.\\\" We selected a random sample of 50,000 tweets to feed into InstructGPT to obtain the emotion-cause labels. After fltering out entries with NA for both emotion and causes, we ended up with 42,956 data points.\\nLastly, we evaluated several language model candidates on the training dataset to identify the most suitable model for labeling the entire dataset. For the task of generative text, we considered three candidate models: BART-large, T5-base, and T5-fan.\\nThese models were trained and assessed on the $42\\\\mathrm{k}$ dataset (which was split into train, val, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio). The models\\u2019 performance was measured using the BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) and BERT-score (Zhang et al., 2020), which are reported in table 1. As shown in the results, T5-fan outperforms all the other models for all the metrics, scoring 0.91 on BERT-score making it very close to the performance of the responses generated by InstructGPT. To guarantee the quality of our dataset, we sample 100 data points and manually inspected the emotion cause generated by the model. We observed that tweets with poor grammar tend to have poor quality of emotion causes. Therefore, we utilize TextAttack\\u2019s grammar checker 2 model to flter out datapoints with poor grammar. This step leaves the dataset with 698800 tweets.

Traditional metrics fail to capture the quality of these summaries (Kryscinski et al., 2020), so we use human evaluation criteria commonly used in summarization tasks. We adapt the criteria to ft the brevity of tweets and use Relevance, Fluency, and Consistency metrics while omitting Coherence, which is typically used for long text. This approach is similar to that used by Zhan et al. (2022). Relevance assesses whether the emotion cause accurately represents the root cause of the emotion. For tweets that describe multiple events, the principal source of emotion should be the targeted event for the emotion cause. Fluency looks at the grammatical correctness of the response. To ensure consistency between the tweet and its summary, evaluators check that the details align. They verify the emotion label\\u2019s accuracy and evaluate the emotion cause on a scale of 1 to 5.\\n\\nWe compared data quality from human annotators and our model. Specifcally, we want to understand the differences in the interpretation of emotions and their causes in tweets. To achieve this, we asked annotators to identify the emotion and describe its cause. We provided four potential emotion label options based on the tweet\\u2019s emotion words. If there were fewer than four emotion words, we selected labels with similar affective properties. We used AffectiveSpace (Cambria et al., 2015) to identify emotion words with similar affective properties and provided four pre-generated options for emotion labels. Annotators could provide their own response if none of the options represented the expressed emotion. For the cause description, we offered pre-generated summaries and allowed annotators to supply their own response.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Since our dataset consists of tweets that follow the outlined structure, we select the emotion words that ft this pattern as the emotion label for each tweet. Although exceptions exist, such as instances of negating statements within tweets, our error analysis found that most cases follow this rule. Thus, we simply extract the emotion label from the word that fts into our identifed pattern. This method ensures that the emotion label accurately refects the individual\\u2019s true feelings, unlike traditional methods where emotion labels are determined by human annotators, which can introduce biases.\\nAfter obtaining the emotion label, we proceed to extract the cause of the emotion. We approach this task by treating it as a question-answer challenge. Given a tweet and an emotion label $e$ , we train a language model to answer the question: Why do I feel $e?$ At frst glance, this task appears simple, especially considering tweets are usually short. Therefore, one might expect traditional Q&A models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to perform well. However, most Q&A models are designed to answer questions in an extractive way, which prevents them from providing abstractive, generalized answers about emotion causes.\\n\\nGiven these limitations of extraction-based models in identifying emotion causes, an alternative approach would be to frame the problem as a generative question-answering problem. This method, however, requires additional training data for pretrained models. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) have shown impressive abilities in following instructions and performing tasks like summarization.\\nLLMs have been trained on a vast amount of text and have often demonstrated a remarkable ability to generalize. Previous studies, like those by Bosselut et al. (2019) have used LLMs to generate abstractive common-sense knowledge relations. These models have also been used to generate pseudolabels for training smaller models on more specialized tasks, as noted in studies by Ye et al. (2022) and (Taori et al., 2023). This method is very economical. It eliminates the need for human annotators while utilizing freely available pre-trained language models without incurring the full cost of labeling millions of tweets with GPTs. Using this approach, we experimented with various prompts before settling on the following prompt to obtain the emotion and cause labels from InstructGPT: \\\"Answer the following questions: 1. What is the emotion expressed in the text? 2. What is the cause of such emotion? Provide the answer in the following format strictly: 1. E where E is the emotion from this list: [list of 48 emotions], 2. $C$ where C is the summary of the cause in 10 words. Use NA for $E$ when there is no emotion, and use NA for $C$ when there is no cause.\\\" We selected a random sample of 50,000 tweets to feed into InstructGPT to obtain the emotion-cause labels. After fltering out entries with NA for both emotion and causes, we ended up with 42,956 data points.\\nLastly, we evaluated several language model candidates on the training dataset to identify the most suitable model for labeling the entire dataset. For the task of generative text, we considered three candidate models: BART-large, T5-base, and T5-fan.\\nThese models were trained and assessed on the $42\\\\mathrm{k}$ dataset (which was split into train, val, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio). The models\\u2019 performance was measured using the BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) and BERT-score (Zhang et al., 2020), which are reported in table 1. As shown in the results, T5-fan outperforms all the other models for all the metrics, scoring 0.91 on BERT-score making it very close to the performance of the responses generated by InstructGPT. To guarantee the quality of our dataset, we sample 100 data points and manually inspected the emotion cause generated by the model. We observed that tweets with poor grammar tend to have poor quality of emotion causes. Therefore, we utilize TextAttack\\u2019s grammar checker 2 model to flter out datapoints with poor grammar. This step leaves the dataset with 698800 tweets. Figure 2 shows a summary of our method and table 2 shows the popular keywords of emotion causes that correspond to a selected number of emotions.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

As social media comments for a video include discussions on many tangential issues, these steps deemed necessary to confirm that we will be able to select posts related to peace and violence in the context of Bangladesh. This pipeline is also depicted in the Figure 1.\\n\\u2022 Data Pre-processing and Deanonymization: We removed all comments that included any code-mixed data, URLs, spam, or non-Bangla texts and removed comments that solely consisted of emojis without any accompanying text. Then we removed personally identifying information e.g., names, phone numbers, user mentions and addresses from the comments. This process left a total of 80,185 comments.\\n\\u2022 Unsupervised Topic Modeling for Content Understanding: To understand main themes that are prevalent within this large collection of posts, we performed unsupervised topic modeling. We observed five major clusters of words based on the optimal coherence score. Following the work of Galtung (1990), we could map four of the clusters to Kill\\/Attack, Resocialization\\/Desocialization\\/Oppression, Passive Violence\\/Justification, and Peace\\/Non-violence. The fifth cluster of words contained terms like \\u201cdemand\\u201d, \\u201crights\\u201d, \\u201cprotest\\u201d, \\u201cfreedom\\u201d, etc., and thus we considered it to be the fifth topic for \\u201cSocial Rights.\\u201d\\n\\u2022 Guided-LDA with Human in the Loop for Content Filtering: We selected most relevant words for each of the five topics, and using those five sets of seed-words, we performed seed-guided semi-supervised topic modeling (Guided-LDA) on 80,185 data with two human experts in the loop to discover only the relevant terms for each topic (Tasnim et al., 2021). At the end of each iteration, we selected 100 top frequent terms from each cluster and then Both of our experts discussed and agreed to each term before its inclusion to extend the respective see word lists. Both the seed and final word lists for each categories are presented in the Table 11 of Appendix.\\nFinally, we used these extended seed word lists to filter out the posts that contained those specific seeds to select posts for each category with a higher chance (shown as rule-based annotation in the Figure 1).
