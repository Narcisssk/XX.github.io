{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We use F1 scores as the main evaluation metrics (Zhang et al., 2021a; Mao et al., 2022). All reported F1 scores are averaged over 5 runs with different random seeds. For multi-task settings, we use a different split of the training and development sets in each run.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We frst evaluate the performance of the scoring model by measuring how well it distinguishes the correct and incorrect argument role predictions from an event extraction model. Specifcally, we compute event predictions by running a fully trained event extraction model (i.e., OneIE or AMR-IE) on the validation and test sets of the three benchmark datasets. Based on the gold event annotations, we create a gold binary label (correct or incorrect) for each argument role prediction to indicate its correctness. For each event prediction, we pass it along with the corresponding AMR graph of the source sentence into the scoring model. If the correctness16 predicted by the scoring model agrees with the gold binary label, we treat it as a true prediction for scoring model, otherwise, a false prediction.\\nTo examine the impact of leveraging AMR in scoring model performance, we develop a baseline scoring model that shares the same structure with our proposed scoring model except that it does not take an AMR graph as an input. Specifcally, the baseline scoring model just takes the event mention (triggers, arguments and argument labels) in order to measure the compatibility score. The baseline scoring model is essentially an ablation of our scoring model where the AMR path is absent. As shown in Table 2, the performance of our scoring model outperforms the baseline scoring model by 1.4-1.7 F-score on the test sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graph in characterizing the correctness of each event prediction.\\nIn Table 1, we can observe that the semantics and structure of AMR paths can be easily mapped to argument role types. Sometimes, the even triggers are far from their arguments in plain text, but the AMR paths between them is short and informative. Another observation is that the scoring model tends to assign positive scores to argument roles that are more compatible with the AMR paths, although sometimes the scores for the gold argument roles are not the highest.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 3 shows the event extraction results of both our approach and strong baselines17. For clarity, in the rest of the section, we refer to our proposed framework as STFAMR and our proposed framework with the baseline scoring model as STFW\\/O_AMR. We can see that, both STFAMR and STFW\\/O_AMR improve the performance of the event extraction models on argument role classifcation while the vanilla self-training and GradLRE barely work, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging the feedback to the pseudo labels during selftraining.\\nWe further analyze the reasons in terms of why the vanilla self-training and GradLRE do not work and notice that: due to the data scarcity, the base event extraction model (i.e., OneIE) performs poorly on many argument roles (lower than $40\\\\%$ F-score). Thus, the event predictions on unlabeled corpora can be very noisy and inaccurate. The model suffers from confrmation bias (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017; Arazo et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020): it accumulates errors and diverges when it\\u2019s iteratively trained on such noisy pseudo labeled examples during self-training. In addition, we also notice that with self-training, the event extraction model becomes overconfdent about its predictions. We check the averaged probability of all the argument role predictions on the unlabeled dataset which is 0.93. In such case, it is clear that the predicted probability can not faithfully refect the correctness of the predictions, which is referred as the calibration error (Guo et al., 2017; NiculescuMizil and Caruana, 2005). Thus, the self-training process which relies on overconfdent prediction can become highly biased and diverge from the initial baseline model. In GradLRE, the quality of the reward is highly depend on the averaged gradient direction computed during the supervised training process. However, due to the scarcity of the training data, the stored gradient direction can be unreliable. In addition, the gradient computed on the pseudo-labeled dataset with high reward is used to update the average gradient direction, which can introduce noises into the reward function. As seen in Table 3, the best models of self-training and GradLRE are on par or worse than the baseline approach, and these approaches show the detrimental effects as they show a continuous decline of the performance as training proceeds.\\n\\nBy considering AMR structure, STFAMR encourages the event extraction models to predict event structures that are more compatible with AMR graphs. This claim is supported by Table 4, which compares the compatibility scores between the model without STF (OneIE baseline) and one with STF (OneIE $+{\\\\bf S}\\\\mathrm{TF}$ ) framework on the three benchmark datasets. The compatibility scores are measured by the AMR based scoring models. We can clearly see that the compatibility scores measured on OneIE+STFAMR are much higher than the scores measured on base OneIE.\\nLastly, we observe that OneIE+STFAMR outperforms AMR-IE $^{,+}$ STFAMR, even when AMR-IE performs better than OneIE baseline without STF. We argue the reason is that even though STFAMR does not need AMR parsing at inference time, AMRIE does require AMR graphs at inference time which causes it to suffer from potential errors in the AMR parsing. On the other hand, OneIE trained by STFAMR does not require AMR graphs at inference time, making it free from potential error propagation. Figure 2 shows more examples to illustrate how the feedback from AMR structures in STF helps to improve event predictions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To gain a deeper understanding of cTBLS, we conducted human evaluation using the metrics outlined by Nakamura et al. (2022), namely Coherence, Fluency, and Informativeness. For the evaluation of these metrics, we enlisted crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess $50\\\\%$ of the test data. The evaluation process involved a comparison between the responses generated by HYBRIDIALOGUE and cTBLS Top-3.\\nIn accordance with the methodology delineated in Nakamura et al. (2022), Coherence was defned as the degree to which a response continued the conversation in a logically coherent manner based on prior context. Fluency, conversely, was determined by evaluating absence of grammatical and spelling errors, and appropriate use of parts of speech.\\nTo ensure the quality of the evaluated responses, we engaged crowd workers possessing a Masters qualifcation on AMT and originating from Englishspeaking countries (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Great Britain). Each task required approximately 30 seconds to complete, and workers were remunerated at a rate of $\\\\mathbb{S}0.05$ per task. Moreover, to minimize bias and guarantee the dependability of the evaluations, we assigned two crowd workers to assess each response, with a response deemed more coherent or fuent only if both evaluations concurred.\\nThe results presented in Table 5 reveal that the responses generated by cTBLS Top-3 were more coherent than those produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE in $84.2\\\\%$ of cases and exhibited greater fuency $82.7\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that improvements in table retrieval, knowledge retrieval, and response generation lead to better downstream performance.\\nInformativeness represents the accuracy of machine-generated responses when compared to the ground-truth (Nakamura et al., 2022) and serves as a measure of hallucination in LLMs. Hallucinated responses tend to be less informative, deviating signifcantly from the ground-truth.\\nTo evaluate informativeness, crowd workers determined whether generated responses were semantically equivalent to the ground truth response. Each response was assessed by two Turkers, and a response was deemed more informative only if there was inter-annotator agreement. The absence of illustrative examples in the prompting process resulted in responses generated by cTBLS Top-1 and cTBLS Top-3 being longer than the ground truth response. Consequently, the knowledge-augmented cTBLS responses were considered informative if all the information provided in the ground truth was encapsulated in the model response, even if cTBLS included supplementary information.\\n\\nThe data in Table 6 indicate that cTBLS Top-3 encompasses the same information as the ground truth response $50\\\\%$ of the time, a higher rate than cTBLS Top-1 at $45.6\\\\%$ , exemplifying the benefts of partitioning retrieval into coarse and fne state tracking and augmenting with additional knowledge. Based on these fndings, we hypothesize that the attention mechanism in decoder models facilitates additional knowledge retrieval. cTBLS NoK generates the correct response $30.6\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that HYBRIDIALOGUE comprises questions and answers predicated on general world knowledge embedded in the weights of LLMs. Responses produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE are informative in merely $12.4\\\\%$ of instances.\\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of responses generated by various confgurations of cTBLS on the HYBRIDIALOGUE dataset. The entire dialogue history constitutes the context and is depicted as an exchange between the user (in blue) and the system (in yellow). The fnal question box represents the follow-up query to be addressed, while the last answer chat box indicates the ground truth response. Knowledge K1, K2, and K3 correspond to cells of the table retrieved during state tracking, based on which responses are produced. cTBLS NoK generates a response solely relying on the context, cTBLS Top-1 formulates a response conditioned on K1, and cTBLS Top-3 devises a response based on K1, K2, and K3.\\ncTBLS NoK creates a hallucinated response, answering with the random Faroese club B68 Toftir. Similarly, cTBLS Top-1 hallucinates a response, opting for B36 T\\u00f3rshavn, as K1 refers to the stadium Vi\\u00f2 Marg\\u00e1ir rather than the correct club\\u2019s name. In contrast, cTBLS Top-3 produces the accurate response, EB\\/Streymur, since K3 contains the necessary information. This example demonstrates the benefts of augmenting response generation with additional pertinent knowledge, which aids in mitigating the hallucination problem (Maynez et al., 2020).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Evaluation details\\nE.1\\nSynthetic tasks\\nWe implement our neural process by modifying the Llama 2 architecture [42] to model sequences of\\ncontinuous variables.

This issue was also reported by the community 1. Also, METEOR and Entropy are reproduced. Our reproduced BLEU scores are close to the original paper so we directly quote their results.\\nOur human evaluators are recruited from Amazon Mturk. In terms of human evaluation, all generated responses are re-capitalized and de-tokenized fairly. The salary for each evaluator is 1 dollar per 10 samples. To give a fair salary, we frst evaluate 50 samples by ourselves, calculate the time and effort, and set this amount (samples evaluated by ourselves are just for evaluating the salary, which is not given to evaluators and not reported in the fnal results).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Please refer to Appendix A.3 and Appendix A.4 for details of automatic evaluation metrics. Some differences from previous works are emphasized here. We employ improved versions of BLEU and ROUGE-L, which can better correlate n-gram overlap with human judgment by weighting the relevant n-gram compared with original BLEU (Chen and Cherry, 2014). Although using the improved versions of BLEU and ROUGE-L will result in lower literal values on the corresponding metrics, this does not affect the fairness of the comparison. We adopt the implementation of distinct-1\\/2 metrics following previous study (Bahuleyan et al., 2018).
