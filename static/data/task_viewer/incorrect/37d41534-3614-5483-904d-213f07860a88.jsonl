{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Experiments\",\"section_content\":\"Experiments\\nWe study different LLM-approaches to programming-by-examples across three domains (Fig. 1):\\n1. List functions is a PBE domain meant to model a \\u201cprogrammer\\u2019s assistant\\u201d. It concerns\\ndiscovering algorithms that transform lists of numbers, given input-output examples. This\\nproblem statement has a long history within program synthesis [13, 34], and was popularized\\nwithin machine learning by DeepCoder [35]. We consider two modern list function datasets\\ncreated by Rule et al. 2024 [17] and Shi et al. 2023 [12], which both involve higher-order\\nfunctions and nontrivial procedures such as map, filter, and sort. Rule et al. was recently\\nadded to BigBench [36].\\n2. Text editing is a domain where a program synthesizer assists an end-user edit their spread-\\nsheets or other documents. From string-to-string examples, the system generates edit\\nmacros for tasks such as reformatting dates, extracting fields from semistructured text,\\netc. [2, 37, 38, 4]. Text editing is the most prominent commercial success of PBE: The\\nFlashFill PBE system ships in Microsoft Excel and is used by many millions of people [6].\\nWe consider two text editing datasets: SyGuS problems [22]\\u2014which are easier\\u2014and\\nPROSE [39] problems, which constitute the most challenging dataset of its kind [38].\\n3. LOGO\\/Turtle graphics is a domain whose goal is to synthesize a program that generates a\\ntarget image.1 Systems of this kind can be used both for high-level visual reasoning and\\nfor helping artists make structured edits to images [40, 41]. We use a dataset of geometric\\ndesigns expressed as LOGO\\/Turtle [42] programs\\u2014where the programs move a simulated\\npen over a canvas\\u2014taken from Wong et al. [43]. To allow the LLM to visually perceive the\\ninput image, we convert the image to ASCII-art style strings; see Fig. 5 and Appendix. A.1.3.\\n1This is PBE with a single example and null input, effectively compressing the image into a program.\\n4\\n4.1\\nHow well does the fine-tuned model perform?\\nWe prepare seed datasets for each domain, synthetically generate a large training set, and then\\nfine-tune a DeepSeekCoder LLM [44] that was pretrained on source code.2 For list functions we seed\\nwith 50 problems from Rule et al. 2024; For text editing, we consider seeding with either SyGuS or a\\n40-problem subset of PROSE; for LOGO we seed with 200 training-set problems in Wong et al. [43].\\nThe resulting fine-tuned models are surprisingly effective within their respective PBE domains. On\\nlist functions our finetuned model surpasses the best symbolic search baselines reported in Rule et al.\\n(Fig. 3a), surpasses the best neurosymbolic search method from Shi et al. (Appendix Fig. 10), and\\nsurpasses GPT4. It also solves 100% of the list to list benchmark problems from \\u03bb2 (a well-known\\nsymbolic synthesizer), shown in Appendix Tbl. 4: although plausibly, many \\u03bb2 problems are in\\nthe pretraining data. On text editing, it surpasses the performance of FlashFill and approaches the\\nlevel of FlashFill++ (Tbl. 1, Fig. 3b). On LOGO, it solves 90% of the test set (Fig. 3c), surpassing\\nsystems such as DreamCoder [45], which introduced the first version of these LOGO problems. It\\nalso solves more problems than LILO and Regal [43, 46], which are LOGO program synthesizers\\nthat input natural language describing how the image should be drawn. In contrast, our model does\\nnot use any language clues, generating purely from the image. In addition to quantitatively solving\\nmore problems, we note that there are qualitative improvements to the breadth of problems that can\\nbe solved in the first place because the LLM can generate Turing-complete code spanning a much\\nbroader space of computations (Fig. 4).\\n0\\n100\\n200\\nSearch Budget (Num Samples)\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n% Problems Solved\\nFleet \\nMetagol\\nRobustFill\\nours-33b\\nours-7b\\ngpt-4-turbo\\ngpt-4-turbo CoT\\ndeepseek33b\\n(a) Lists\\n0\\n100\\n200\\nSearch Budget (Num Samples)\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\nFlashFill\\nours-33b\\nours-7b\\ngpt-4-turbo\\ngpt-4-turbo CoT\\ndeepseek33B\\n(b) Strings\\n0\\n200\\n400\\n      Search Budget (Num Samples)\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nRegal\\nLILO\\nDreamCoder\\nours-33b\\nours-7b\\ngpt-4o\\ngpt-4o-mini\\n(c) Graphics\\nFigure 3: Test set performance.

Average pixel intensity indicated by numbers 0-9\\nThe second caveat is that the model degrades when tested out-of-distribution. An example of this\\ndegradation is illustrated in Fig. 6, which tests the LOGO graphics model on hand drawings (after\\ntraining on clean computer graphics). On the out-of-distribution hand drawing the model mostly\\nsamples programs that do not fit the data, but its accuracy does not fall to zero, meaning that with\\nenough compute budget, it does actually generate reasonable programs. This foreshadows the results\\nin Sec. 4.3, which more systematically studies out-of-distribution behavior.\\n\\u2705\\nFigure 6: Example out-of-distribution LOGO test: inferring a graphics program from a hand drawing.\\nSee also Appendix Fig. 12\\n6\\n4.2\\nWhat causes the fine-tuned model to succeed or fail?\\nClassic symbolic approaches to PBE, when they are based on enumeration, tend to succeed whenever\\nthe target program is syntactically small. Approaches based on clever dynamic programming, such as\\nthe FlashFill family [4], succeed when the program is representable in the domain-specific language.\\nWhat predicts success for these LLM approaches?\\nTo answer this question we investigate several hypotheses. First, potentially the success is deter-\\nmined by program size, and degrades as programs grow longer. Second, as a more refined notion\\nof size, we instead measure the description length under the prior, which for a program \\u03c1, is\\n\\u2212log pLM(\\u03c1|G(Dseed)). Description length under the prior would be a good predictor of success if\\nthe fine-tuned model engages in blind guess-and-check: simply learning the distribution G(Dseed),\\nand sampling from this prior while ignoring the input-outputs. Third, one possibility is that success is\\npredicted by description length under the approximate posterior (\\u2212log q\\u03b8(\\u03c1|X, Y )), which would\\nbe the case if the fine-tuned model attends closely to the input-outputs and reshapes its distribution\\naccordingly, instead of defaulting to the prior. To test these hypotheses we calculate the average\\ncompute budget needed to solve each problem, and compare it with these different variables. Fig. 7\\nshows that posterior description length is more predictive than program size and prior description\\nlength: unlike classical methods, metrics of program length correlate poorly with problem diffi-\\nculty, and there is no evidence that the fine-tuned model\\u2019s behavior can be characterized as blind\\nguess-and-check.

Indeed, some classic methods can, within their domains, synthesize programs\\nperfectly (i.e. always find a program that fits the training input-outputs). In contrast, neural networks\\ncan struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution.\\nWe therefore consider train\\/test splits that force the model to generalize beyond the distribution of\\nits training data (beyond Dseed). On text editing, we seed with SyGuS problems, and perform out-\\nof-distribution testing on PROSE problems (PROSE is much harder than SyGuS). On list functions,\\nwe seed with problems from Rule et al. 2024 and test on Shi et al. 2023 (the Shi dataset contains\\nunusual combinators, such as Scan). On LOGO, we seed with short programs (\\u226412 lines of code),\\nand test on long programs (> 12 lines of code). Using these splits we also measure the ability of the\\nadaptation method in Sec. 3 to improve out-of-distribution generalization.4\\nFig. 8 shows that there is nontrivial degradation when testing out of distribution. For example, a 7B\\nmodel seeded with PROSE problems and tested on a different subset of PROSE has an accuracy of\\n76% (Fig. 3b), but this degrades to 59% when seeded with SyGuS problems, which follow a different\\ndistribution and are generally simpler and easier than PROSE (Fig. 8b).\\n4We work here with 7B models because Sec. 4.1 found that fine-tuned 33B models are only slightly better\\nthan 7B, and 7B is cheaper to run.\\n7\\nWe further perform the adaptation method described in Sec. 3 in order to measure the extent to which\\nit can narrow these domain gaps. In every case it allows solving more out-of-distribution problems,\\nincreasing absolute performance by around 10% or more in all domains, which is a relative increase\\nof about 16% for text\\/list and a relative increase of about 190% for LOGO (approximately tripling\\nthe number of solved LOGO problems).\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\nSearch Budget (Num Samples)\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n% Problems Solved\\nbefore adaptation\\nadaptation\\nfinetuned\\nin-distribution\\n(a) Rule adapted to Shi\\n0\\n200\\n400\\nSearch Budget (Num Samples)\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n% Problems Solved\\nbefore adaptation\\nadaptation\\nfinetuned\\nin-distribution\\n(b) SyGuS adapted to PROSE\\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\nSearch Budget (Num Samples)\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n% Problems Solved\\nbefore adapation\\nadaptation\\nfinetuned in-distribution\\n(c) LOGO short adapted to long\\nFigure 8: Out-of-distribution generalization and adaptation to new test distribution.\\nTo better understand the dynamics of adaptation, we visualize the specific problems solved before and\\nafter adaptation on LOGO graphics (Fig. 9).

Adaptation allows the system to\\nquickly solve similar out-of-distribution problems in the future, but does not allow the system to\\ngeneralize to problems very unlike those originally solvable by the fine-tuned model. In principle,\\nexpanding the inference-time compute budget should allow successful adaptation (large K in Eq. 5).\\nAnother more compute-efficient approach would be to increase the amount of adaptation data by\\nintroducing \\u2018steppingstone\\u2019 problems in the adaptation set that give a gentler transition from the\\noriginal training distribution.\\nSolved Before Adapt\\nSolved After Adapt\\nSolved when also trained\\nwith long programs\\nFigure 9: Out-of-distribution LOGO problems (requiring long programs with > 12 lines of code).

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"page_content\":\"Adaptation.\\nOne of the most powerful features of source code as a representation is its ability to\\nefficiently express a wide range of computations. Therefore it is of interest to study the ability of\\nfine-tuned LLMs to extrapolate to PBE problems outside the distribution of the fine-tuning data.\\nWe consider a basic approach to adapting to a different distribution of problems, assuming access to\\nproblems drawn from the testing distribution, but without labeled program solutions. This mimics\\nthe deployment of PBE systems to end-users who may have their own idiosyncratic distribution\\nof problems they care about, and who do not provide ground-truth programs, but who can provide\\nfeedback on if a generated program has correct behavior. This means we have an unlabeled dataset\\nDadapt comprising input-outputs (X, Y ), as well as a labeled seed dataset Dseed comprising triples\\n(\\u03c1, X, Y ). Adaptation proceeds by iterating between pretraining with G(Dseed), testing on Dadapt, and\\nadding back into Dseed any program solutions found on the adaptation problems, which then become\\nseeds for the next iteration. This produces a sequence of fine-tuned models, indexed below by i:\\ntrain model:\\n\\u03b8i = arg max\\n\\u03b8\\nlog q\\u03b8(\\u03c1|X, Y ), where (\\u03c1, X) \\u223cG(Di\\nseed) and Y = \\u03c1(X)\\nrun inference:\\n\\u03c1X,Y\\nk\\n\\u223cq\\u03b8i(\\u03c1|X, Y ) for (X, Y ) \\u2208Dadapt and k from 1..K\\nupdate seed:\\nDi+1 = Di \\u222a\\nn\\n(\\u03c1X,Y\\nk\\n, X, Y ) : (X, Y ) \\u2208Dadapt, k \\u2208[K] if \\u03c1X,Y\\nk\\n(X) = Y\\no\\n(5)\\nThe equations can be seen as a wake-sleep algorithm where \\u201cdreaming\\u201d corresponds to training q\\non fantasy data (first equation) while \\u201cwaking\\u201d corresponds to running inference and updating the\\ngenerative model G (by updating the seed, second pair of equations). Ideally, each cycle of this\\nwake-sleep adaptation solves more out-of-distribution problems, which tugs the generative model G\\ntoward the target distribution, unlocking solutions to more out-of-distribution problems, etc. This\\nhinges on each iteration actually solving new problems from the unlabeled dataset. Theoretically\\nthis is guaranteed given enough inference-time compute (large K above). We explore in Sec. 4.3 the\\nextent to which this holds in practice.\\n4\\nExperiments\\nWe study different LLM-approaches to programming-by-examples across three domains (Fig. 1):\\n1. List functions is a PBE domain meant to model a \\u201cprogrammer\\u2019s assistant\\u201d. It concerns\\ndiscovering algorithms that transform lists of numbers, given input-output examples. This\\nproblem statement has a long history within program synthesis [13, 34], and was popularized\\nwithin machine learning by DeepCoder [35]. We consider two modern list function datasets\\ncreated by Rule et al. 2024 [17] and Shi et al. 2023 [12], which both involve higher-order\\nfunctions and nontrivial procedures such as map, filter, and sort. Rule et al. was recently\\nadded to BigBench [36].\\n2. Text editing is a domain where a program synthesizer assists an end-user edit their spread-\\nsheets or other documents. From string-to-string examples, the system generates edit\\nmacros for tasks such as reformatting dates, extracting fields from semistructured text,\\netc. [2, 37, 38, 4]. Text editing is the most prominent commercial success of PBE: The\\nFlashFill PBE system ships in Microsoft Excel and is used by many millions of people [6].\\nWe consider two text editing datasets: SyGuS problems [22]\\u2014which are easier\\u2014and\\nPROSE [39] problems, which constitute the most challenging dataset of its kind [38].\\n3. LOGO\\/Turtle graphics is a domain whose goal is to synthesize a program that generates a\\ntarget image.1 Systems of this kind can be used both for high-level visual reasoning and\\nfor helping artists make structured edits to images [40, 41]. We use a dataset of geometric\\ndesigns expressed as LOGO\\/Turtle [42] programs\\u2014where the programs move a simulated\\npen over a canvas\\u2014taken from Wong et al. [43]. To allow the LLM to visually perceive the\\ninput image, we convert the image to ASCII-art style strings; see Fig. 5 and Appendix. A.1.3.\\n1This is PBE with a single example and null input, effectively compressing the image into a program.\\n4\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"4.1\\nHow well does the fine-tuned model perform?\\nWe prepare seed datasets for each domain, synthetically generate a large training set, and then\\nfine-tune a DeepSeekCoder LLM [44] that was pretrained on source code.2 For list functions we seed\\nwith 50 problems from Rule et al. 2024; For text editing, we consider seeding with either SyGuS or a\\n40-problem subset of PROSE; for LOGO we seed with 200 training-set problems in Wong et al. [43].\\nThe resulting fine-tuned models are surprisingly effective within their respective PBE domains. On\\nlist functions our finetuned model surpasses the best symbolic search baselines reported in Rule et al.\\n(Fig. 3a), surpasses the best neurosymbolic search method from Shi et al. (Appendix Fig. 10), and\\nsurpasses GPT4. It also solves 100% of the list to list benchmark problems from \\u03bb2 (a well-known\\nsymbolic synthesizer), shown in Appendix Tbl. 4: although plausibly, many \\u03bb2 problems are in\\nthe pretraining data. On text editing, it surpasses the performance of FlashFill and approaches the\\nlevel of FlashFill++ (Tbl. 1, Fig. 3b). On LOGO, it solves 90% of the test set (Fig. 3c), surpassing\\nsystems such as DreamCoder [45], which introduced the first version of these LOGO problems. It\\nalso solves more problems than LILO and Regal [43, 46], which are LOGO program synthesizers\\nthat input natural language describing how the image should be drawn. In contrast, our model does\\nnot use any language clues, generating purely from the image. In addition to quantitatively solving\\nmore problems, we note that there are qualitative improvements to the breadth of problems that can\\nbe solved in the first place because the LLM can generate Turing-complete code spanning a much\\nbroader space of computations (Fig. 4).\\n0\\n100\\n200\\nSearch Budget (Num Samples)\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n% Problems Solved\\nFleet \\nMetagol\\nRobustFill\\nours-33b\\nours-7b\\ngpt-4-turbo\\ngpt-4-turbo CoT\\ndeepseek33b\\n(a) Lists\\n0\\n100\\n200\\nSearch Budget (Num Samples)\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\nFlashFill\\nours-33b\\nours-7b\\ngpt-4-turbo\\ngpt-4-turbo CoT\\ndeepseek33B\\n(b) Strings\\n0\\n200\\n400\\n      Search Budget (Num Samples)\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nRegal\\nLILO\\nDreamCoder\\nours-33b\\nours-7b\\ngpt-4o\\ngpt-4o-mini\\n(c) Graphics\\nFigure 3: Test set performance.
