{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Methodology\",\"section_content\":\"Methodology\\nThis study employs two different approaches for\\nhumour style recognition: the single-model and\\nthe two-model approach. A total of 14 models\\nwere evaluated, including Naive Bayes, Random\\nForest, XGBoost (each with six different text em-\\nbeddings), and DistilBERT. Figure 2 illustrates the\\ntwo-model approach, which first classifies humour\\ninstances into broader groups before refining to\\nspecific styles.\\n263\\n4.1\\nClassifiers and Embedding Models\\n4.1.1\\nClassifiers\\nThe selection of classifiers was based on their suit-\\nability for the task at hand and efficiency in low-\\nresource settings, avoiding resource-intensive large\\nlanguage models such as GPT4 and LLaMA prone\\nto overfitting on small datasets due to their complex\\narchitectures (Schur and Groenjes, 2024; Diwakar\\nand Raj, 2024; Berfu B et al., 2020):\\nNaive Bayes (NB): A probabilistic classifier\\nbased on the Bayes Theorem, assuming condi-\\ntional independence of features given the target\\nclass (Berrar, 2019).\\nRandom Forest (RF): A bagging ensemble clas-\\nsifier using majority voting from multiple decision\\ntrees (Jin, 2020).\\neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): A\\nboosting ensemble classifier aggregating predic-\\ntions of several weak learners, with regularisation\\nto prevent overfitting (Jiang et al., 2019).\\nDistilBERT: A condensed BERT variant, of-\\nfering faster performance and memory efficiency\\nwhile maintaining competitive performance on\\nNLP tasks (Sanh et al., 2019).\\n4.1.2\\nSentence Embedding Models\\nTo capture distinct linguistic nuances and improve\\nclassification performance, we selected six em-\\nbedding models from the top 20 on the Massive\\nText Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard.\\nThese models were chosen for their robustness, ef-\\nficiency, speed, and lightweight memory usage:\\n\\u2022 General Text Embeddings (GTE) and GTE\\nUpgraded (ALI) (Li et al., 2023)\\n\\u2022 BAAI General Embedding (BGE) (Xiao et al.,\\n2022; Zhang et al., 2023)\\n\\u2022 Matryoshka Representation Learning and Bi-\\nnary Quantization (MRL) (Lee et al., 2024)\\n\\u2022 Universal AnglE Embedding (UAE) (Li and\\nLi, 2023)\\n\\u2022 Multilingual E5 Text Embeddings (MUL)\\n(Wang et al., 2024)\\nThese embeddings were combined with RF and\\nXGBoost classifiers for humour style recognition.\\n4.2\\nSingle-Model Approach\\nIn this approach, a single ML model is trained to\\nclassify the input text into one of the five classes:\\nself-enhancing (label 0), self-deprecating (label\\n1), affiliative (label 2), aggressive (label 3), and\\nneutral (label 4). This approach treats the task\\nas a multi-class classification problem, where the\\nmodel needs to distinguish between all five classes\\nsimultaneously.\\nTo provide insight into the single-model per-\\nformance, Figure 3 presents the confusion ma-\\ntrices for the 5-fold cross-validation results of\\nfour models: Naive Bayes (NB) 3a, GTE+RF 3b,\\nMUL+XGBoost 3c, and UAE+RF 3d.\\n4.3\\nTwo-Model Approach\\nTo address limitations observed in the single-model\\napproach, particularly in distinguishing affiliative\\nhumour, we developed a two-model approach. This\\nmethod, inspired by previous studies (Khan et al.,\\n2022; Van Lam et al., 2011; Demidova, 2021),\\nimproves classification performance by breaking\\ndown the problem into multiple steps.\\nThe rationale behind this approach is to first sep-\\narate the instances into broader groups and then fo-\\ncus on the more challenging task of distinguishing\\nbetween affiliative and aggressive humour styles.\\nThis strategy is informed by an analysis of mis-\\nclassified samples from the cross-validation and\\ntest set evaluation of the single-model approach,\\nwhich revealed that affiliative humour was predom-\\ninantly misclassified as aggressive humour. This\\npattern of misclassification is clearly illustrated in\\nthe cross-validation confusion matrices shown in\\nFigure 3.\\nThe two-model approach involves two sequential\\nsteps:\\n1. Step 1: Four-Class Classification Model:\\nTrain an ML model to distinguish between\\nself-enhancing, self-deprecating, neutral, and\\na combined affiliative\\/aggressive class.\\n2. Step 2: Binary Classification Model: Train\\na separate binary classification model to dis-\\ntinguish between affiliative and aggressive in-\\nstances from the combined class in step 1.\\nThis approach allows for optimising overall per-\\nformance by combining the best-performing mod-\\nels for each subtask.\\n4.4\\nExperimental Setup\\nThe humour styles dataset was split 80\\/20 for train-\\ning and testing, randomised using a fixed seed of\\n100 to ensure reproducibility. We used 5-fold cross-\\nvalidation for all experiments to validate model\\nperformance and prevent overfitting. For the NB\\nclassifier, we used a smoothing parameter of 1. The\\nRF and XGBoost classifiers were implemented us-\\ning their default hyperparameters.
