{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Using a Zero-Shot approach with two different Transformer architectures, BLOOM and RoBERTa, we generate three different types of spoilers: phrase, passage and multi. We found, RoBERTa pretrained for Question-Answering to perform better than BLOOM for causal language modelling, however both architectures proved promising for future attempts at such tasks.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Chick Adams at SemEval-2023 Task 5: Using RoBERTa and DeBERTa to Extract Post and Document-based Features for Clickbait Spoiling\",\"abstract\":\"In this manuscript, we describe the participation of the UMUTeam in SemEval-2023 Task 5, namely, Clickbait Spoiling, a shared task on identifying spoiler type (i.e., a phrase or a passage) and generating short texts that satisfy curiosity induced by a clickbait post, i.e. generating spoilers for the clickbait post. Our participation in Task 1 is based on fine-tuning pre-trained models, which consists in taking a pre-trained model and tuning it to fit the spoiler classification task. Our system has obtained excellent results in Task 1: we outperformed all proposed baselines, being within the Top 10 for most measures.

The choice of basic parameters like sequence length with BERT[BASE] uncased and further approaches were then tested with DeBERTaV3[BASE] only moving the most promising ones to DeBERTaV3[LARGE]. Our research showed that information-placement on webpages is often optimized regarding e.g. ad-placement Those informations are usually described within the webpages markup which is why we conducted an approach that takes this into account. Overall we could not manage to beat the baseline, which we lead down to three reasons: First we only crawled markup for Huffington Post articles, extracting only p- and a-tags which will not cover enough aspects of a webpages design. Second Huffington Post articles are overrepresented in the given dataset, which, third, shows an imbalance towards the spoiler tags. We highly suggest re-annotating the given dataset to use markup-optimized models like MarkupLM or TIE and to clear it from embedded articles like \\u201cYahoo\\u201d or archives like \\u201carchive.is\\u201d or \\u201cweb.archive\\u201d to avoid noise. Also, the imbalance should be tackled by adding articles from sources other than Huffington Post, considering that also multi-tagged entries should be balanced towards passage- and phrase-tagged ones.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Matt Bai at SemEval-2023 Task 5: Clickbait spoiler classification via BERT\",\"abstract\":\"The Clickbait Spoiling shared task aims at tackling two aspects of spoiling: classifying the spoiler type based on its length and generating the spoiler. This paper focuses on the task of classifying the spoiler type. Better classification of the spoiler type would eventually help in generating a better spoiler for the post. We use BERT-base (cased) to classify the clickbait posts. The model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.63 as we give only the post content as the input to our model instead of the concatenation of the post title and post content to find out the differences that the post title might be bringing in.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Alexander Knox at SemEval-2023 Task 5: The comparison of prompting and standard fine-tuning techniques for selecting the type of spoiler needed to neutralize a clickbait\",\"abstract\":\"Clickbait posts are a common problem on social media platforms, as they often deceive users by providing misleading or sensational headlines that do not match the content of the linked web page. The aim of this study is to create a technique for identifying the specific type of suitable spoiler - be it a phrase, a passage, or a multipart spoiler - needed to neutralize clickbait posts. This is achieved by developing a machine learning classifier analyzing both the clickbait post and the linked web page. Modern approaches for constructing a text classifier usually rely on fine-tuning a transformer-based model pre-trained on large unsupervised corpora. However, recent advances in the development of large-scale language models have led to the emergence of a new transfer learning paradigm based on prompt engineering. In this work, we study these two transfer learning techniques and compare their effectiveness for clickbait spoiler-type detection task. Our experimental results show that for this task, using the standard fine-tuning method gives better results than using prompting. The best model can achieve a similar performance to that presented by Hagen et al. (2022).\"}\n{\"title\":\"Francis Wilde at SemEval-2023 Task 5: Clickbait Spoiler Type Identification with Transformers\",\"abstract\":\"Clickbait is the text or a thumbnail image that entices the user to click the accompanying link.

The large context of the article associated with the clickbait and differences in the spoiler forms, make the task challenging. Hence, to tackle the large context, we propose an Information Condensation-based approach, which prunes down the unnecessary context. Given an article, our filtering module optimised with a contrastive learning objective first selects the parapraphs that are the most relevant to the corresponding clickbait.The resulting condensed article is then fed to the two downstream tasks of spoiler type classification and spoiler generation. We demonstrate and analyze the gains from this approach on both the tasks. Overall, we win the task of spoiler type classification and achieve competitive results on spoiler generation.\"}\n{\"title\":\"HonestBait: Forward References for Attractive but Faithful Headline Generation\",\"abstract\":\"Current methods for generating attractive headlines often learn directly from data, which bases attractiveness on the number of user clicks and views. Although clicks or views do reflect user interest, they can fail to reveal how much interest is raised by the writing style and how much is due to the event or topic itself. Also, such approaches can lead to harmful inventions by over-exaggerating the content, aggravating the spread of false information. In this work, we propose HonestBait, a novel framework for solving these issues from another aspect: generating headlines using forward references (FRs), a writing technique often used for clickbait. A self-verification process is included during training to avoid spurious inventions. We begin with a preliminary user study to understand how FRs affect user interest, after which we present PANCO, an innovative dataset containing pairs of fake news with verified news for attractive but faithful news headline generation. Auto matic metrics and human evaluations show that our framework yields more attractive results (+11.25% compared to human-written verified news headlines) while maintaining high veracity, which helps promote real information to fight against fake news.\"}\n{\"title\":\"Brooke-English at SemEval-2023 Task 5: Clickbait Spoiling\",\"abstract\":\"The task of clickbait spoiling is: generating a short text that satisfies the curiosity induced by a clickbait post.
