{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Method\\nIn this section, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, which leverages the\\nconditional diffusion model to generate high-rewarding, novel, and dynamically plausible trajectories\\nfor augmentation. As shown in Figure 2, our method is divided into three stages: (1) Train a\\nconditional diffusion model at the trajectory level. (2) Augment trajectories using a partial noising\\nand denoising framework with amplified return guidance. (3) Train any offline RL algorithm with\\nthe augmented dataset. We will discuss how each component works and their roles in effective data\\naugmentation.\\n4.1\\nStage A: Train Diffusion Model\\nTrajectory-level generation. The diffusion model for GTA is designed to generate the subtrajectory\\n\\u03c4. This subtrajectory is a consecutive transition sequence of the state, action, and reward sampled\\nfrom a trajectory (s1, a1, r1, ..., sT , aT , rT ). We represent subtrajectory \\u03c4 with horizon H as follows:\\n\\u03c4 =\\n\\\" st\\nst+1\\n\\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7\\nst+H\\u22121\\nat\\nat+1\\n\\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7\\nat+H\\u22121\\nrt\\nrt+1\\n\\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7\\nrt+H\\u22121\\n#\\n(6)\\nWe train a conditional diffusion model to approximate the conditional distribution p(\\u03c4|y(\\u03c4)) with\\noffline dataset, where the condition y(\\u03c4) = PT\\ni=t \\u03b3i\\u2212tri denotes the sum of the discounted return.\\nThe parameter \\u03b8 is updated to maximize the expected log-likelihood of the data:\\n\\u03b8\\u2217\\u2190arg max\\n\\u03b8\\nE\\u03c4\\u223cD [log p\\u03b8(\\u03c4|y(\\u03c4))] .\\n(7)\\n4\\nUsing a diffusion model to generate trajectories offers multiple advantages. First, the diffusion model\\nleverages sequential relationships between consecutive transitions while generating trajectories,\\nallowing it to minimize the degradation of dynamic plausibility. Second, the diffusion model captures\\nlong-term transition dynamics, which is beneficial for environments with sparse rewards.\\nDiffusion Model Implementation. Integrating sequential dependencies within the subtrajectory into\\nthe model architecture is essential for trajectory-level generation. Therefore, we choose a denoising\\nnetwork that combines Temporal-Unet [21] with MLP-mixer [33] to exploit both local and global\\nsequential information. We adopted the Elucidated Diffusion Model [30], known for its powerful\\nperformance in recent work [13]. The implementation details are elaborated in Appendix A.2.\\n4.2\\nStage B: Augment Trajectory-level Data\\nWe propose a novel approach to augment trajectories, partial noising and denoising framework with\\namplified return guidance. Partial noising modifies the original trajectory using the forward process\\nof the diffusion model, thus providing exploration opportunities. The exploration level is adjusted\\nby the nosing ratio \\u00b5. Following this, denoising with amplified return guidance refines the noised\\ntrajectory. During the denoising process, we guide the trajectory towards high-rewarding regions,\\npromoting the exploitation of learned knowledge about the environment. We introduce the multiplier\\nfor conditioned return \\u03b1 to control the exploitation level. Figure 3 outlines the principle of data\\naugmentation via partial noising and denoising framework.\\nNoising Process\\nGuided Denoising Process\\nHigh Rewarding Region\\nOriginality Preserving Region\\n!!\\n!\\n!!!\\u22c5#\\n!!\\\"\\u22c5#\\n!!#\\u22c5#\\n\\\"\\n#!\\n\\\"\\n\\\"\\n##\\n\\\"\\n\\\"\\n#$\\n\\\"\\nOriginal Trajectory\\nFigure 3: Mechanism of the partial noising and de-\\nnoising framework. The extent of exploration increases\\nwith \\u00b5 (\\u00b51 < \\u00b52 < \\u00b53). During denoising, amplified\\nreturn guidance shifts trajectories towards the high-\\nrewarding region.\\nPartial noising with forward process.\\nLet \\u03c4 = \\u03c4 0 represent the original trajectory,\\nand k denotes the diffusion timestep. We in-\\ntroduce a noising ratio \\u00b5(0 < \\u00b5 = k\\nK \\u22641)\\nto determine the extent of erasing informa-\\ntion of the trajectory for exploration. We\\nadd noise to the original trajectory \\u03c4 0, cre-\\nating a noised trajectory denoted as \\u03c4 \\u00b5\\u00b7K \\u223c\\nN(\\u03c4; \\u03c4 0, \\u03c3(\\u00b5 \\u00b7 K)2I).\\nThe parameter \\u00b5\\ncontrols the level of exploration. Small \\u00b5\\nresults in minimal exploration, thereby pre-\\nserving much of the original information of\\nthe trajectory. Large \\u00b5 facilitates broader\\nexploration, potentially leading to generat-\\ning novel trajectories while losing original\\ninformation significantly.\\nDenoising with amplified return guidance.\\nAfter noising the trajectory, we reconstruct the trajectory with classifier-free guidance to push the\\ntrajectory towards the high-rewarding region to enhance optimality. We introduce amplified return\\nguidance, which sets the conditioning value as the multiplied return of the original trajectory. It\\ncan prevent adverse effects that occur when significantly larger return values are conditioned during\\ngeneration. Further analysis on this phenomenon is elaborated in Appendix F.1.\\nThe amplified return is formally defined as follows:\\n\\u02c6\\ny(\\u03c4 0, \\u03b1) = \\u03b1 \\u00b7\\nT\\nX\\ni=t\\n\\u03b3i\\u2212tri,\\n(8)\\nwhere \\u03b1 is the control parameter for the exploitation level. We set \\u03b1 > 1 to make the conditioning\\nvalue higher than the return of the original trajectory. \\u03b1 close to 1 induces mild conversion towards a\\nhigh-rewarding trajectory region, while large \\u03b1 promotes significant drift, substantially exploiting the\\ndiffusion model. Our partial noising and denoising framework can be summarized as follows:\\nPartial Noising : (\\u03c4 0 \\u2192\\u03c4 \\u00b5\\u00b7K = \\u03c4 noised)\\n(9)\\nDenoising : (\\u03c4 \\u00b5\\u00b7K \\u2192\\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u2192\\u02dc\\n\\u03c4 0 = \\u03c4 denoised)\\n(10)\\n5\\n4.3\\nStage C: Offline RL Policy Training\\nThe final stage of GTA is utilizing high-quality trajectories generated through previous stages for\\npolicy training. The trajectories generated by GTA can seamlessly integrate with existing offline RL\\nmethods. By introducing GTA, we can orthogonally integrate the expressiveness and controllability\\nof diffusion models with existing offline RL algorithms.\\n4.4\\nAdditional Technique: Reweighted Sampling\\nTo concentrate on samples in high-rewarding regions, we additionally adopt a reweighting strategy\\n[34, 35] during the sampling process. This approach prioritizes the sampling of subtrajectories with\\nhigher returns. Consequently, augmented trajectories are more densely distributed in high-rewarding\\nregions. The complete specification of our reweighting strategy, including implementation details\\nand parameter configurations, is provided in Appendix A.3.\\n5\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
