{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We urge the academic community to take\\nheed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse\\nand authentic digital information landscape.1\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nThe integration of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023;\\nGoogle, 2023) is reshaping the online information\\nlandscape, making text generation easier, increas-\\ning content production, enhancing personalized\\nknowledge assistance, and enabling advanced fake\\nnews creation. Schick (2020) suggest that by 2026,\\nsynthetic content could dominate up to 90% of the\\nweb. CounterCloud2 shows that a single developer\\ncan create an AI fake news factory cheaply and con-\\nvincingly. AI-driven content generation is rapidly\\n1We release the resources at https:\\/\\/github.com\\/\\nVerdureChen\\/SOS-Retrieval-Loop\\n2https:\\/\\/countercloud.io\\/?page_id=307\\nFigure 1: The evolution of RAG systems after introduc-\\ning LLM-generated texts, where the \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d\\neffect gradually emerges.\\nbecoming commonplace, impacting how content is\\nproduced and shared (Goldstein et al., 2023; Pan\\net al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023b). These developments\\npose novel challenges and opportunities for infor-\\nmation retrieval (IR) and generation, especially for\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,\\nwhich combine both capabilities (Guu et al., 2020;\\nLewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard\\net al., 2023). As text produced by large language\\nmodels continues to flood the internet and is in-\\ndexed by search systems, the enduring effects of\\nsuch text on the retrieval-generation process grow\\nmore ambiguous, and the future landscape of the\\ninformation environment is yet to be determined.\\nIn our research, we focus on the effects of LLM-\\ngenerated text on RAG systems. As shown in Fig-\\nure 1, we construct a pipeline that simulates the\\ncontinuous influx of LLM-generated text into\\nweb datasets and assess its impact on the perfor-\\nmance of RAG through iterative runs. To evaluate\\nthe RAG performance in the simulation process,\\nwe adopt the Open Domain Question Answering\\n(ODQA) task as our evaluative benchmark due to\\nits recent surge in research popularity as an effec-\\ntive test of both retrieval accuracy and generation\\nquality (Pan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). We\\n14930\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"employ widely used retrieval and re-ranking meth-\\nods to supply the context necessary for LLMs to\\ngenerate answer documents. Upon evaluating these\\ndocuments, we integrate them into the text corpus\\nfor subsequent retrieval-generation cycles. This\\nprocess is repeated multiple times to monitor and\\nassess the emerging patterns. Experimental results\\nshow that LLM-generated text has an immediate\\neffect on RAG systems, generally improving re-\\ntrieval outcomes while producing varied effects on\\nQA performance. However, over the long term, a\\nmarked decrease in retrieval effectiveness emerges,\\nwhile the QA performance remains unaffected.\\nFurther examination reveals a bias in search sys-\\ntems towards LLM-generated texts, which consis-\\ntently rank higher than human-written content. As\\nLLM-generated texts increasingly dominate the\\nsearch results, the visibility and influence of human-\\nauthored web content diminish, fostering a digital\\n\\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d effect. This effect aptly explains\\nwhat we observe in our simulations and reveals\\nthe potential negative impact of LLM-generated\\ntexts on the information ecosystem: while LLM-\\ngenerated texts sometimes provide a more effective\\nIR experience in the short term, in the long term\\nthey may lead to the invisibility of human-authored\\ncontent, the homogenization of search results, and\\nthe inaccessibility of certain accurate information,\\nthereby adversely affecting public knowledge ac-\\nquisition and decision-making.\\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold:\\n1) We propose an iterative pipeline to investigate\\nthe short-term and long-term impacts of LLM-\\ngenerated text on RAG systems. 2) We study the\\npotential emergence of a \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d phe-\\nnomenon within RAG systems. 3) We analyze\\nthe implications of this phenomenon, offering a\\nnew perspective on the dynamic interplay between\\nLLM-generated content and RAG systems.\\n2\\nRelated Works\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation. RAG systems\\nhave been extensively analyzed, demonstrating re-\\ntrieval\\u2019s role in enhancing language model effi-\\ncacy (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud\\net al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023).\\nThese systems also curtail LLMs\\u2019 hallucinations\\nduring text generation (Ji et al., 2023; Huang et al.,\\n2023a) and reduce knowledge obsolescence (He\\net al., 2023). Applied in ODQA (Izacard and Grave,\\n2021; Trivedi et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a) and\\nother tasks (Cai et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2023),\\ncurrent research explores LLMs\\u2019 output accuracy\\nagainst specific contexts (Adlakha et al., 2023), ro-\\nbustness to extraneous information (Chen et al.,\\n2023), and the effects of output integration strate-\\ngies (Liu et al., 2023b).

Advances in Artificial Intel-\\nligence Generated Content (AIGC) have signifi-\\ncantly impacted society and technology. LLMs\\nfacilitate creating content to combat misinforma-\\ntion (Xu et al., 2023; Chen and Shu, 2023) but\\ncan also produce damaging content (Huang et al.,\\n2023b). The potential biases and discrimination in\\nAIGC have garnered widespread attention (Liang\\net al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2023). Shumailov et al.\\n(2023) and Alemohammad et al.

The \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d the-\\nory (Noelle-Neumann, 1974), is a seminal theory\\nwithin the field of communications that describes\\nhow people may suppress their views to avoid iso-\\nlation, thus often reinforcing dominant public opin-\\nions (Scheufle and Moy, 2000; Liu et al., 2019;\\nLin et al., 2022). We shift focus to a novel \\u201cpas-\\nsive human silence\\u201d influenced by LLMs, where\\nrapid AI content production and biased search al-\\ngorithms potentially marginalize human contribu-\\ntions in public discourse.

For further dis-\\ncussion regarding the rationale for applying this\\ntheory to our study, please see Appendix A.1.\\n3\\nPipeline Construction\\nIn this section, a simulation framework is designed\\nto explore the potential impacts that texts generated\\nby LLMs may have on RAG systems. This frame-\\nwork models a simplified process that tracks how\\nRAG systems gradually adjust their responses as\\nthey accumulate LLM-generated text over time.\\n3.1\\nPreliminaries\\nAn RAG system f can be formalized as f : (Q \\u00d7\\nD \\u00d7 K) \\u2192S, where Q is the set of queries, D\\nrepresents a large collection of documents, K is the\\nknowledge within the LLM, and S is the set of text\\noutputs generated by the system. For a particular\\nquery q \\u2208Q, the goal of the RAG system is to\\nfind a mapping f(q, D, K) = s that produces a\\nresponse text s \\u2208S satisfying the query q. This\\nprocess involves two stages:\\nRetrieval Stage, executed by the retrieval func-\\ntion R, is formally defined as R : (Q \\u00d7 D) \\u2192D\\u2032,\\nwhere D\\u2032 \\u2286D represents the subset of documents\\njudged by R to be most relevant to the query q.\\nGeneration Stage, executed by the generation\\nfunction G : (P \\u00d7 Q \\u00d7 D\\u2032 \\u00d7 K) \\u2192S. Its task is\\nto utilize the prompt p \\u2208P, the query q \\u2208Q, the\\nrelated document subset D\\u2032, and the knowledge of\\nLLMs K to construct the answer s.\\nWithin the entire RAG system f, the functions R\\nand G act in series to form a process expressed as\\nf(q, D, K) = G(p, q, R(q, D), K). In this man-\\nner, the RAG system integrates the precision of IR\\nwith the richness of LLMs to provide information-\\nrich content when answering questions.\\n3.2\\nSimulation Process\\nOur simulation process starts with a pure human-\\nauthored text dataset and gradually introduces the\\nLLM-generated text, observing how this change\\nover time affects the RAG system. Adhering to\\nthe specifications outlined in Section 3.1, the RAG\\narchitecture is instantiated and expanded with ad-\\nditional details. In the retrieval stage, we apply\\nsparse and dense retrieval strategies to obtain a can-\\ndidate document set that is relevant to the query.\\nAdditionally, we also have the option to perform\\na re-ranking of the candidate documents to further\\noptimize the process. In the generation stage, we\\nuse the LLMs which are widely used to generate\\nresponses. To accurately simulate the evolution\\nprocess of the RAG system, we specifically use an\\niteratively updated indexing structure that sup-\\nports incorporating the newly generated LLM text\\ninto the index in each iteration, keeping the dataset\\nupdated for subsequent retrieval and evaluation.\\nSpecifically, the iterative simulation process\\nunfolds as follows: 1) Baseline Establishment:\\nUtilizing an initial dataset comprised of human-\\nauthored text unaffected by LLM (D0), ascertain\\nthe performance of a benchmark RAG pipeline.\\n2) Zero-shot Text Introduction: The baseline\\ndataset D0 is enriched with text set T (zero-shot)\\nLLM\\ngenerated by LLMs in zero-shot manner, yielding\\nD1 = D0 \\u222aT (zero-shot)\\nLLM\\n. This simulates the evo-\\nlution of users\\u2019 application of LLMs from initial\\nzero-shot deployments to sophisticated RAG con-\\nfigurations. 3) Retrieval and Re-ranking: For\\neach query q, a subset of documents D\\u2032\\ni is retrieved\\nfrom the dataset Di through a retrieval and optional\\nre-ranking step R(q, Di) \\u2192D\\u2032\\ni. The retrieval func-\\ntion R remains constant throughout the experimen-\\ntal process to control variables. 4) Generation\\nPhase: Answers S are generated using the LLMs\\n(G(p, D\\u2032, q, K) \\u2192s) with a uniform prompt p in\\nthe experiment. 5) Post-processing Phase: Post-\\nprocess S to obtain S\\u2032, removing text fragments\\nthat may expose the identity of the LLMs. 6) Index\\nUpdate: Integrate S\\u2032 into Di to update the dataset\\nto Di+1. 7) Iterative Operation: Repeat steps 3\\nto 6 for each new dataset Di+1, until the required\\nnumber of iterations t is reached.\\nThe pseudo-code for this process is presented\\nin Appendix A.2. Through the simulation process,\\nwe observe how LLM-generated text influences the\\nRAG systems and how this impact evolves with\\ndata accumulation. While the main simulation as-\\nsumes that the LLMs remain static due to their\\nrelatively infrequent update cycles, we also con-\\nduct experiments on the effects of LLM evolution\\nover time in Appendix A.6. For prompt and post-\\nprocessing details, see Appendix A.9 and A.3.\\n4\\nExperiment\\nDatasets and Metrics. We conduct experiments\\non commonly used ODQA datasets, including\\nNQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), WebQ (Berant\\net al., 2013), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and\\nPopQA (Mallen et al., 2022). We preprocess the\\n14932\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"datasets following Yu et al. (2023) and Zhang et al.\\n(2023). Given the constraints on experimental re-\\nsources, we randomly select 200 samples from each\\ntest set. When evaluating the retrieval phase, we\\nutilize Acc@5 and Acc@20 following Karpukhin\\net al. (2020). These metrics assess the proportion of\\nquestions where the correct answers appear in the\\ntop 5 or top 20 retrieval results, respectively. For\\nthe answer quality of the LLM output for each iter-\\nation, we follow Chen et al. (2023) by applying the\\nExact Match (EM) metric, which checks if the cor-\\nrect answer is fully contained within the generated\\ntext. Furthermore, in Section 5, we adopt a holistic\\nperspective to examine the RAG pipeline, with a\\nfocus on the interaction between the retrieval and\\ngeneration phases and how the ranking of human-\\ngenerated texts changes over time.\\nRetrieval and Re-ranking Methods. In our\\nexperiments, we employ a variety of retrieval\\nmethods, including the sparse model BM25, the\\ncontrastive learning-based dense retriever Con-\\ntriever (Izacard et al., 2022), the advanced BGE-\\nBase (Xiao et al., 2023) retriever, and the LLM-\\nEmbedder (Zhang et al., 2023) designed for LLMs.\\nFor the results retrieved using BM25 and BGE-\\nBase, we separately apply the T5-based (Raf-\\nfel et al., 2020) re-ranking model MonoT5-\\n3B (Nogueira et al., 2020), the UPR-3B (Sachan\\net al., 2022) which uses the unsupervised capabil-\\nities of T0-3B (Sanh et al., 2022), and the BGE-\\nReranker (Xiao et al., 2023), which is based on the\\nXLM-RoBERTa-Large (Conneau et al., 2020).\\nGenerative Models. Considering the complex-\\nity and variability of real-world environments, the\\ntext that is continuously integrated into the system\\nmay be generated by a variety of LLMs. Our iter-\\native experiments incorporate text produced by a\\nsuite of prevalent LLMs. These include GPT-3.5-\\nTurbo (OpenAI, 2022), LLaMA2-13B-Chat (Tou-\\nvron et al., 2023), Qwen-14B-Chat (Bai et al.,\\n2023), Baichuan2-13B-Chat (Yang et al., 2023),\\nand ChatGLM3-6B (Du et al., 2022). This enables\\nthe RAG systems to blend varied linguistic styles\\nand knowledge, leading to results that more closely\\nreplicate real-world scenarios. For more implemen-\\ntation details, please refer to Appendix A.4.\\n5\\nResults\\nIn this section, we examine both initial and ex-\\ntended iterations within the simulation framework.\\nWe define the short-term effect as the immediate\\neffects observed in the first iteration, while the\\nlong-term effect is analyzed from the second to\\nthe tenth iteration. We investigate the occurrence\\nof the \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d effect and how RAG sys-\\ntems respond. Under the task settings of ODQA,\\nwe analyze the potential influence of the \\u201cSpiral of\\nSilence\\u201d on RAG systems\\u2019 response patterns.\\n5.1\\nShort-Term Effects on RAG Performance\\nWhen comparing RAG system results using differ-\\nent retrieval methods on the original dataset versus\\nthe augmented one in the first iteration, we observe\\nthat: 1) Immediate Impact of LLM-Generated\\nText on the RAG System: The introduction of a\\nminimal amount of LLM-generated text produces\\nimmediate effects on both retrieval and QA perfor-\\nmance of the RAG system, as shown in Table 1 and\\nFigure 2. Specifically, both retrieval and generation\\nperformance exhibit noticeable fluctuations. These\\nchanges highlight the sensitivity of the system to\\neven small modifications made by LLM-generated\\ntext.\\n2) LLM-Generated Text Generally Im-\\nproves Retrieval Accuracy: Table 1 reveals that\\nadding LLM-generated responses to a dataset typ-\\nically enhances the accuracy of retrieval systems,\\nas measured by Acc@5 and Acc@20 metrics. For\\nexample, using the BM25 on TriviaQA resulted in\\naccuracy improvements of 31.2% and 19.1% re-\\nspectively. However, a slight decline in Acc@5\\nis also observed in certain cases. This suggests a\\nprimarily positive, yet complex, impact of LLM-\\ngenerated text on retrieval accuracy. 3) The Impact\\non QA Performance is Mixed: Due to space con-\\nstraints, we only present the results of four retrieval\\nmethods. As shown in Figure 2, while the RAG\\nsystem\\u2019s QA performance typically surpasses the\\nzero-shot LLM outputs, the addition of LLM text\\ncan either enhance or impair QA performance de-\\npending on the dataset and retrieval strategy. It\\nappears to enhance performance for TriviaQA, but\\nfor NQ and PopQA, the effect is detrimental with\\nnon-BM25 retrieval methods, suggesting that with-\\nout significant retrieval enhancement, LLM text\\ninclusion might be counterproductive.\\n5.2\\nLong-term Effects on RAG Performance\\nIn this section, we investigate whether the short-\\nterm effects are predictive of the long-term behav-\\nior of the system. We present the results on NQ and\\nPopQA in Figure 3.

However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infltrating the web and infuencing the retrievalgeneration feedback loop are largely uncharted territories. In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems. Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our fndings reveal a potential digital \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online. This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.1\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Google, 2023) is reshaping the online information landscape, making text generation easier, increasing content production, enhancing personalized knowledge assistance, and enabling advanced fake news creation. Schick (2020) suggest that by 2026, synthetic content could dominate up to $90\\\\%$ of the web. CounterCloud2 shows that a single developer can create an AI fake news factory cheaply and convincingly. AI-driven content generation is rapidly becoming commonplace, impacting how content is produced and shared (Goldstein et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023b). These developments pose novel challenges and opportunities for information retrieval (IR) and generation, especially for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which combine both capabilities (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023). As text produced by large language models continues to food the internet and is indexed by search systems, the enduring effects of such text on the retrieval-generation process grow more ambiguous, and the future landscape of the information environment is yet to be determined.\\n\\nIn our research, we focus on the effects of LLMgenerated text on RAG systems. As shown in Figure 1, we construct a pipeline that simulates the continuous infux of LLM-generated text into web datasets and assess its impact on the performance of RAG through iterative runs. To evaluate the RAG performance in the simulation process, we adopt the Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as our evaluative benchmark due to its recent surge in research popularity as an effective test of both retrieval accuracy and generation quality (Pan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). We employ widely used retrieval and re-ranking methods to supply the context necessary for LLMs to generate answer documents. Upon evaluating these documents, we integrate them into the text corpus for subsequent retrieval-generation cycles. This process is repeated multiple times to monitor and assess the emerging patterns. Experimental results show that LLM-generated text has an immediate effect on RAG systems, generally improving retrieval outcomes while producing varied effects on QA performance. However, over the long term, a marked decrease in retrieval effectiveness emerges, while the QA performance remains unaffected.\\n\\nFurther examination reveals a bias in search systems towards LLM-generated texts, which consistently rank higher than human-written content. As LLM-generated texts increasingly dominate the search results, the visibility and infuence of humanauthored web content diminish, fostering a digital \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d effect. This effect aptly explains what we observe in our simulations and reveals the potential negative impact of LLM-generated texts on the information ecosystem: while LLMgenerated texts sometimes provide a more effective IR experience in the short term, in the long term they may lead to the invisibility of human-authored content, the homogenization of search results, and the inaccessibility of certain accurate information, thereby adversely affecting public knowledge acquisition and decision-making.\\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) We propose an iterative pipeline to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of LLMgenerated text on RAG systems. 2) We study the potential emergence of a \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d phenomenon within RAG systems. 3) We analyze the implications of this phenomenon, offering a new perspective on the dynamic interplay between LLM-generated content and RAG systems.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Retrieval Augmented Generation. RAG systems have been extensively analyzed, demonstrating retrieval\\u2019s role in enhancing language model effcacy (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023). These systems also curtail LLMs\\u2019 hallucinations during text generation (Ji et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a) and reduce knowledge obsolescence (He et al., 2023). Applied in ODQA (Izacard and Grave, 2021; Trivedi et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a) and other tasks (Cai et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2023), current research explores LLMs\\u2019 output accuracy against specifc contexts (Adlakha et al., 2023), robustness to extraneous information (Chen et al., 2023), and the effects of output integration strategies (Liu et al., 2023b). Our study aims to provide a novel perspective to observe and predict the potential trajectory and impact of its future development.\\n\\nEffects of AIGC. Advances in Artifcial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have signifcantly impacted society and technology. LLMs facilitate creating content to combat misinformation (Xu et al., 2023; Chen and Shu, 2023) but can also produce damaging content (Huang et al., 2023b). The potential biases and discrimination in AIGC have garnered widespread attention (Liang et al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2023). Shumailov et al. (2023) and Alemohammad et al. (2023) show that LLMs trained on self-generated data degrade without fresh real-world input. Pan et al. (2023) investigated the impact of erroneous information generated by LLMs on ODQA systems. Dai et al. (2023a) indicated that AI-modifed texts might rank higher in search results, potentially affecting the fairness of those outcomes. Our research aims to further explore the short-term and long-term effects on RAG systems when AIGC text is continuously integrated into the search system\\u2019s datasets.\\nSpiral of Silence. The \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d theory (Noelle-Neumann, 1974), is a seminal theory within the feld of communications that describes how people may suppress their views to avoid isolation, thus often reinforcing dominant public opinions (Scheufe and Moy, 2000; Liu et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022). We shift focus to a novel \\u201cpassive human silence\\u201d infuenced by LLMs, where rapid AI content production and biased search algorithms potentially marginalize human contributions in public discourse. This theory stands apart from concepts such as \\u201cecho chambers\\\", \\u201cflter bubbles\\\", and \\u201cdegenerate feedback loops\\u201d prevalent in recommendation systems (Alatawi et al., 2021; Chitra and Musco, 2020; Jiang et al., 2019). While these terms describe the narrowing of informational scope as users engage with algorithmic systems, the \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d theory proposes a scenario where human users are compelled into silence in public discourse due to the infuence of LLMs and IR systems. This phenomenon goes beyond mere selective exposure or algorithmic recommendations. Our study explores how\\nLLM-generated text might induce a \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d in RAG systems over time. For further discussion regarding the rationale for applying this theory to our study, please see Appendix A.1.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In this section, a simulation framework is designed to explore the potential impacts that texts generated by LLMs may have on RAG systems. This framework models a simplifed process that tracks how RAG systems gradually adjust their responses as they accumulate LLM-generated text over time.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"An RAG system $f$ can be formalized as $f:(Q\\\\times$ $D\\\\times K)\\\\to S$ , where $Q$ is the set of queries, $D$ represents a large collection of documents, $K$ is the knowledge within the LLM, and $S$ is the set of text outputs generated by the system. For a particular query $q\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,Q$ , the goal of the RAG system is to fnd a mapping $f(q,D,K)\\\\,=\\\\,s$ that produces a response text $s\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,S$ satisfying the query $q$ .

Adhering to the specifcations outlined in Section 3.1, the RAG architecture is instantiated and expanded with additional details. In the retrieval stage, we apply sparse and dense retrieval strategies to obtain a candidate document set that is relevant to the query. Additionally, we also have the option to perform a re-ranking of the candidate documents to further optimize the process. In the generation stage, we use the LLMs which are widely used to generate responses. To accurately simulate the evolution process of the RAG system, we specifcally use an iteratively updated indexing structure that supports incorporating the newly generated LLM text into the index in each iteration, keeping the dataset updated for subsequent retrieval and evaluation.\\n\\nSpecifcally, the iterative simulation process unfolds as follows: 1) Baseline Establishment: Utilizing an initial dataset comprised of humanauthored text unaffected by LLM $(D_{0})$ , ascertain the performance of a benchmark RAG pipeline. 2) Zero-shot Text Introduction: The baseline dataset D0 is enriched with text set T L(zLerMo- $T_{\\\\mathrm{LLM}}^{\\\\mathrm{(zero-shot)}}$ generated by LLMs in zero-shot manner, yielding $D_{1}\\\\,=\\\\,D_{0}\\\\cup T_{\\\\mathrm{LLM}}^{\\\\mathrm{(zero-shot)}}$ . This simulates the evolution of users\\u2019 application of LLMs from initial zero-shot deployments to sophisticated RAG confgurations. 3) Retrieval and Re-ranking: For each query $q$ , a subset of documents $D_{i}^{\\\\prime}$ is retrieved from the dataset $D_{i}$ through a retrieval and optional re-ranking step $R(q,D_{i})\\\\rightarrow D_{i}^{\\\\prime}$ . The retrieval function $R$ remains constant throughout the experimental process to control variables. 4) Generation Phase: Answers $S$ are generated using the LLMs $(G(p,D^{\\\\prime},q,K)\\\\to s)$ with a uniform prompt $p$ in the experiment. 5) Post-processing Phase: Postprocess $S$ to obtain $S^{\\\\prime}$ , removing text fragments that may expose the identity of the LLMs. 6) Index Update: Integrate $S^{\\\\prime}$ into $D_{i}$ to update the dataset to $D_{i+1}$ . 7) Iterative Operation: Repeat steps 3 to 6 for each new dataset $D_{i+1}$ , until the required number of iterations $t$ is reached.\\nThe pseudo-code for this process is presented in Appendix A.2. Through the simulation process, we observe how LLM-generated text infuences the RAG systems and how this impact evolves with data accumulation. While the main simulation assumes that the LLMs remain static due to their relatively infrequent update cycles, we also conduct experiments on the effects of LLM evolution over time in Appendix A.6. For prompt and postprocessing details, see Appendix A.9 and A.3.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Datasets and Metrics. We conduct experiments on commonly used ODQA datasets, including NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), WebQ (Berant et al., 2013), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022). We preprocess the datasets following Yu et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2023). Given the constraints on experimental resources, we randomly select 200 samples from each test set. When evaluating the retrieval phase, we utilize $\\\\mathbf{Acc}\\\\mathbf{\\\\@5}$ and $\\\\mathbf{Acc}\\\\mathbf{\\\\textcircled{\\\\div}}2\\\\mathbf{0}$ following Karpukhin et al. (2020). These metrics assess the proportion of questions where the correct answers appear in the top 5 or top 20 retrieval results, respectively. For the answer quality of the LLM output for each iteration, we follow Chen et al. (2023) by applying the Exact Match (EM) metric, which checks if the correct answer is fully contained within the generated text. Furthermore, in Section 5, we adopt a holistic perspective to examine the RAG pipeline, with a focus on the interaction between the retrieval and generation phases and how the ranking of humangenerated texts changes over time.\\n\\nRetrieval and Re-ranking Methods. In our experiments, we employ a variety of retrieval methods, including the sparse model BM25, the contrastive learning-based dense retriever Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022), the advanced BGEBase (Xiao et al., 2023) retriever, and the LLMEmbedder (Zhang et al., 2023) designed for LLMs. For the results retrieved using BM25 and BGEBase, we separately apply the T5-based (Raffel et al., 2020) re-ranking model MonoT5- 3B (Nogueira et al., 2020), the UPR-3B (Sachan et al., 2022) which uses the unsupervised capabilities of T0-3B (Sanh et al., 2022), and the BGEReranker (Xiao et al., 2023), which is based on the XLM-RoBERTa-Large (Conneau et al., 2020).\\nGenerative Models. Considering the complexity and variability of real-world environments, the text that is continuously integrated into the system may be generated by a variety of LLMs. Our iterative experiments incorporate text produced by a suite of prevalent LLMs. These include GPT-3.5- Turbo (OpenAI, 2022), LLaMA2-13B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Qwen-14B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), Baichuan2-13B-Chat (Yang et al., 2023), and ChatGLM3-6B (Du et al., 2022).

However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infltrating the web and infuencing the retrievalgeneration feedback loop are largely uncharted territories. In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems. Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our fndings reveal a potential digital \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online. This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.1\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2022, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Google, 2023) is reshaping the online information landscape, making text generation easier, increasing content production, enhancing personalized knowledge assistance, and enabling advanced fake news creation. Schick (2020) suggest that by 2026, synthetic content could dominate up to $90\\\\%$ of the web. CounterCloud2 shows that a single developer can create an AI fake news factory cheaply and convincingly. AI-driven content generation is rapidly becoming commonplace, impacting how content is produced and shared (Goldstein et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023b). These developments pose novel challenges and opportunities for information retrieval (IR) and generation, especially for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which combine both capabilities (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023). As text produced by large language models continues to food the internet and is indexed by search systems, the enduring effects of such text on the retrieval-generation process grow more ambiguous, and the future landscape of the information environment is yet to be determined.\\n\\nIn our research, we focus on the effects of LLMgenerated text on RAG systems. As shown in Figure 1, we construct a pipeline that simulates the continuous infux of LLM-generated text into web datasets and assess its impact on the performance of RAG through iterative runs. To evaluate the RAG performance in the simulation process, we adopt the Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as our evaluative benchmark due to its recent surge in research popularity as an effective test of both retrieval accuracy and generation quality (Pan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). We employ widely used retrieval and re-ranking methods to supply the context necessary for LLMs to generate answer documents. Upon evaluating these documents, we integrate them into the text corpus for subsequent retrieval-generation cycles. This process is repeated multiple times to monitor and assess the emerging patterns. Experimental results show that LLM-generated text has an immediate effect on RAG systems, generally improving retrieval outcomes while producing varied effects on QA performance. However, over the long term, a marked decrease in retrieval effectiveness emerges, while the QA performance remains unaffected.\\n\\nFurther examination reveals a bias in search systems towards LLM-generated texts, which consistently rank higher than human-written content. As LLM-generated texts increasingly dominate the search results, the visibility and infuence of humanauthored web content diminish, fostering a digital \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d effect. This effect aptly explains what we observe in our simulations and reveals the potential negative impact of LLM-generated texts on the information ecosystem: while LLMgenerated texts sometimes provide a more effective IR experience in the short term, in the long term they may lead to the invisibility of human-authored content, the homogenization of search results, and the inaccessibility of certain accurate information, thereby adversely affecting public knowledge acquisition and decision-making.\\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) We propose an iterative pipeline to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of LLMgenerated text on RAG systems. 2) We study the potential emergence of a \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d phenomenon within RAG systems. 3) We analyze the implications of this phenomenon, offering a new perspective on the dynamic interplay between LLM-generated content and RAG systems.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Retrieval Augmented Generation. RAG systems have been extensively analyzed, demonstrating retrieval\\u2019s role in enhancing language model effcacy (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023). These systems also curtail LLMs\\u2019 hallucinations during text generation (Ji et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023a) and reduce knowledge obsolescence (He et al., 2023). Applied in ODQA (Izacard and Grave, 2021; Trivedi et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a) and other tasks (Cai et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2023), current research explores LLMs\\u2019 output accuracy against specifc contexts (Adlakha et al., 2023), robustness to extraneous information (Chen et al., 2023), and the effects of output integration strategies (Liu et al., 2023b). Our study aims to provide a novel perspective to observe and predict the potential trajectory and impact of its future development.\\n\\nEffects of AIGC. Advances in Artifcial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have signifcantly impacted society and technology. LLMs facilitate creating content to combat misinformation (Xu et al., 2023; Chen and Shu, 2023) but can also produce damaging content (Huang et al., 2023b). The potential biases and discrimination in AIGC have garnered widespread attention (Liang et al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2023). Shumailov et al. (2023) and Alemohammad et al. (2023) show that LLMs trained on self-generated data degrade without fresh real-world input. Pan et al. (2023) investigated the impact of erroneous information generated by LLMs on ODQA systems. Dai et al. (2023a) indicated that AI-modifed texts might rank higher in search results, potentially affecting the fairness of those outcomes. Our research aims to further explore the short-term and long-term effects on RAG systems when AIGC text is continuously integrated into the search system\\u2019s datasets.\\nSpiral of Silence. The \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d theory (Noelle-Neumann, 1974), is a seminal theory within the feld of communications that describes how people may suppress their views to avoid isolation, thus often reinforcing dominant public opinions (Scheufe and Moy, 2000; Liu et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022). We shift focus to a novel \\u201cpassive human silence\\u201d infuenced by LLMs, where rapid AI content production and biased search algorithms potentially marginalize human contributions in public discourse. This theory stands apart from concepts such as \\u201cecho chambers\\\", \\u201cflter bubbles\\\", and \\u201cdegenerate feedback loops\\u201d prevalent in recommendation systems (Alatawi et al., 2021; Chitra and Musco, 2020; Jiang et al., 2019). While these terms describe the narrowing of informational scope as users engage with algorithmic systems, the \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d theory proposes a scenario where human users are compelled into silence in public discourse due to the infuence of LLMs and IR systems. This phenomenon goes beyond mere selective exposure or algorithmic recommendations. Our study explores how\\nLLM-generated text might induce a \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d in RAG systems over time. For further discussion regarding the rationale for applying this theory to our study, please see Appendix A.1.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In this section, a simulation framework is designed to explore the potential impacts that texts generated by LLMs may have on RAG systems. This framework models a simplifed process that tracks how RAG systems gradually adjust their responses as they accumulate LLM-generated text over time.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"An RAG system $f$ can be formalized as $f:(Q\\\\times$ $D\\\\times K)\\\\to S$ , where $Q$ is the set of queries, $D$ represents a large collection of documents, $K$ is the knowledge within the LLM, and $S$ is the set of text outputs generated by the system. For a particular query $q\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,Q$ , the goal of the RAG system is to fnd a mapping $f(q,D,K)\\\\,=\\\\,s$ that produces a response text $s\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,S$ satisfying the query $q$ . This process involves two stages:\\nRetrieval Stage, executed by the retrieval function $R$ , is formally defned as $R:(Q\\\\times D)\\\\rightarrow D^{\\\\prime}$ , where $D^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq D$ represents the subset of documents judged by $R$ to be most relevant to the query $q$ .\\nGeneration Stage, executed by the generation function $G:(P\\\\times Q\\\\times D^{\\\\prime}\\\\times K)\\\\rightarrow S$ .

In this manner, the RAG system integrates the precision of IR with the richness of LLMs to provide informationrich content when answering questions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Our simulation process starts with a pure humanauthored text dataset and gradually introduces the LLM-generated text, observing how this change over time affects the RAG system. Adhering to the specifcations outlined in Section 3.1, the RAG architecture is instantiated and expanded with additional details. In the retrieval stage, we apply sparse and dense retrieval strategies to obtain a candidate document set that is relevant to the query. Additionally, we also have the option to perform a re-ranking of the candidate documents to further optimize the process. In the generation stage, we use the LLMs which are widely used to generate responses. To accurately simulate the evolution process of the RAG system, we specifcally use an iteratively updated indexing structure that supports incorporating the newly generated LLM text into the index in each iteration, keeping the dataset updated for subsequent retrieval and evaluation.\\n\\nSpecifcally, the iterative simulation process unfolds as follows: 1) Baseline Establishment: Utilizing an initial dataset comprised of humanauthored text unaffected by LLM $(D_{0})$ , ascertain the performance of a benchmark RAG pipeline. 2) Zero-shot Text Introduction: The baseline dataset D0 is enriched with text set T L(zLerMo- $T_{\\\\mathrm{LLM}}^{\\\\mathrm{(zero-shot)}}$ generated by LLMs in zero-shot manner, yielding $D_{1}\\\\,=\\\\,D_{0}\\\\cup T_{\\\\mathrm{LLM}}^{\\\\mathrm{(zero-shot)}}$ . This simulates the evolution of users\\u2019 application of LLMs from initial zero-shot deployments to sophisticated RAG confgurations. 3) Retrieval and Re-ranking: For each query $q$ , a subset of documents $D_{i}^{\\\\prime}$ is retrieved from the dataset $D_{i}$ through a retrieval and optional re-ranking step $R(q,D_{i})\\\\rightarrow D_{i}^{\\\\prime}$ . The retrieval function $R$ remains constant throughout the experimental process to control variables. 4) Generation Phase: Answers $S$ are generated using the LLMs $(G(p,D^{\\\\prime},q,K)\\\\to s)$ with a uniform prompt $p$ in the experiment. 5) Post-processing Phase: Postprocess $S$ to obtain $S^{\\\\prime}$ , removing text fragments that may expose the identity of the LLMs. 6) Index Update: Integrate $S^{\\\\prime}$ into $D_{i}$ to update the dataset to $D_{i+1}$ . 7) Iterative Operation: Repeat steps 3 to 6 for each new dataset $D_{i+1}$ , until the required number of iterations $t$ is reached.\\nThe pseudo-code for this process is presented in Appendix A.2. Through the simulation process, we observe how LLM-generated text infuences the RAG systems and how this impact evolves with data accumulation. While the main simulation assumes that the LLMs remain static due to their relatively infrequent update cycles, we also conduct experiments on the effects of LLM evolution over time in Appendix A.6. For prompt and postprocessing details, see Appendix A.9 and A.3.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Datasets and Metrics. We conduct experiments on commonly used ODQA datasets, including NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), WebQ (Berant et al., 2013), TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and PopQA (Mallen et al., 2022). We preprocess the datasets following Yu et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2023). Given the constraints on experimental resources, we randomly select 200 samples from each test set. When evaluating the retrieval phase, we utilize $\\\\mathbf{Acc}\\\\mathbf{\\\\@5}$ and $\\\\mathbf{Acc}\\\\mathbf{\\\\textcircled{\\\\div}}2\\\\mathbf{0}$ following Karpukhin et al. (2020). These metrics assess the proportion of questions where the correct answers appear in the top 5 or top 20 retrieval results, respectively. For the answer quality of the LLM output for each iteration, we follow Chen et al. (2023) by applying the Exact Match (EM) metric, which checks if the correct answer is fully contained within the generated text. Furthermore, in Section 5, we adopt a holistic perspective to examine the RAG pipeline, with a focus on the interaction between the retrieval and generation phases and how the ranking of humangenerated texts changes over time.\\n\\nRetrieval and Re-ranking Methods. In our experiments, we employ a variety of retrieval methods, including the sparse model BM25, the contrastive learning-based dense retriever Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022), the advanced BGEBase (Xiao et al., 2023) retriever, and the LLMEmbedder (Zhang et al., 2023) designed for LLMs. For the results retrieved using BM25 and BGEBase, we separately apply the T5-based (Raffel et al., 2020) re-ranking model MonoT5- 3B (Nogueira et al., 2020), the UPR-3B (Sachan et al., 2022) which uses the unsupervised capabilities of T0-3B (Sanh et al., 2022), and the BGEReranker (Xiao et al., 2023), which is based on the XLM-RoBERTa-Large (Conneau et al., 2020).\\nGenerative Models. Considering the complexity and variability of real-world environments, the text that is continuously integrated into the system may be generated by a variety of LLMs. Our iterative experiments incorporate text produced by a suite of prevalent LLMs. These include GPT-3.5- Turbo (OpenAI, 2022), LLaMA2-13B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Qwen-14B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), Baichuan2-13B-Chat (Yang et al., 2023), and ChatGLM3-6B (Du et al., 2022). This enables the RAG systems to blend varied linguistic styles and knowledge, leading to results that more closely replicate real-world scenarios. For more implementation details, please refer to Appendix A.4.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In this section, we examine both initial and extended iterations within the simulation framework.

Under the task settings of ODQA, we analyze the potential infuence of the \\u201cSpiral of Silence\\u201d on RAG systems\\u2019 response patterns.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"When comparing RAG system results using different retrieval methods on the original dataset versus the augmented one in the frst iteration, we observe that: 1) Immediate Impact of LLM-Generated Text on the RAG System: The introduction of a minimal amount of LLM-generated text produces immediate effects on both retrieval and QA performance of the RAG system, as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. Specifcally, both retrieval and generation performance exhibit noticeable fuctuations. These changes highlight the sensitivity of the system to even small modifcations made by LLM-generated text. 2) LLM-Generated Text Generally Improves Retrieval Accuracy: Table 1 reveals that adding LLM-generated responses to a dataset typically enhances the accuracy of retrieval systems, as measured by $\\\\operatorname{Acc}\\\\!\\\\circled{\\\\alpha}5$ and $\\\\operatorname{Acc}\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\!\\\\omega\\\\!\\\\,20\\\\right)$ metrics. For example, using the BM25 on TriviaQA resulted in accuracy improvements of $31.2\\\\%$ and $19.1\\\\%$ respectively. However, a slight decline in $\\\\operatorname{Acc}\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\!\\\\omega5\\\\right)$ is also observed in certain cases. This suggests a primarily positive, yet complex, impact of LLMgenerated text on retrieval accuracy. 3) The Impact on QA Performance is Mixed: Due to space constraints, we only present the results of four retrieval methods. As shown in Figure 2, while the RAG system\\u2019s QA performance typically surpasses the zero-shot LLM outputs, the addition of LLM text can either enhance or impair QA performance depending on the dataset and retrieval strategy. It appears to enhance performance for TriviaQA, but for NQ and PopQA, the effect is detrimental with non-BM25 retrieval methods, suggesting that without signifcant retrieval enhancement, LLM text inclusion might be counterproductive.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
