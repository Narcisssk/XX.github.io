{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The pre-training mostly utilizes lexical databases and image queries in English. Previous work has demonstrated that the pre-training in English does not transfer well to other languages in a zero-shot setting. However, multilingual pre-trained language models (MPLM) have excelled at a variety of single-modal language tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effcient approach to adapt VLP to unseen languages using MPLM. We utilize a cross-lingual contextualized token embeddings alignment approach to train text encoders for non-English languages. Our approach does not require image input and primarily uses machine translation, eliminating the need for target language data. Our evaluation across three distinct tasks (image-text retrieval, visual entailment, and natural language visual reasoning) demonstrates that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art multilingual vision-language models without requiring large parallel corpora. Our code is available at https:\\/\\/github.com\\/Yasminekaroui\\/CliCoTea.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Inspired by the recent advancements in language model pre-training, Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) have demonstrated state-of-theart performance across a wide range of visionlanguage (VL) tasks such as text-to-image retrieval, visual reasoning, visual entailment, and visual QA (Chen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021, 2022).\\nHowever, extending VLPMs to multilingual scenarios is still challenging. On one hand, the majority of these models are trained on monolingual (English) corpora and thus cannot perform well for other languages. On the other hand, the multilingual pre-trained language models (Devlin et al.,\\nFigure 1: Overview of our approach. We adapt the text encoder of a monolingual VL model to an unseen language (a). Then we use the adapted model for a VL downstream task in a zero-shot setting (b).\\n2018; Conneau et al., 2019) cannot handle vision data (e.g., images or videos) directly.\\nLately, there have been attempts $\\\\mathbf{(M^{3}P,}$ nUNITER, UC2) to pivot on images or English texts to align multilingual representations with vision features (Chen et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). However, a recent benchmark on multilingual multimodal pretraining (IGLUE) (Bugliarello et al., 2022) shows that although these models achieve promising zeroshot cross-lingual transfer performance on some VL tasks, they still fall short in comparison to the \\u201ctranslate-test\\u201d baseline (using an English-only VLPM on the translations of the text examples).\\nA more recent work (CCLM) achieves promising performance on the IGLUE benchmark by exploiting massive parallel text and image-text corpora to pre-train a VL model (Zeng et al., 2022). This approach is motivated by a key observation that multilingual and multimodal pre-training essentially achieves the same goal of aligning two different views of the same object into a common semantic space. Although this framework performs well on the IGLUE benchmark, it requires a large amount of parallel data. Its pre-training phase relies on 19M multilingual parallel sentence pairs extracted from WikiMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2021), jointly trained with 4 million image-text pairs in multiple languages.\\n\\nIn this work, we are proposing a simple yet effcient way to adapt VLP models to unseen languages without requiring large parallel corpora. We propose to align a VLPM monolingual text encoder (achieving start-of-the-art performance on English downstream VL tasks) with a multilingual pre-trained language model (e.g., mBERT), using only small in-domain parallel text corpus. The recent progress in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has enabled us to create such a parallel corpus from automatically translating the data from English to any other language, even for lowresource languages (i.e., Swahili). However, since our approach relies on token alignment, it is robust to errors made by NMT. Our zero-shot evaluation across three of the four IGLUE tasks shows that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results while using small set of in-domain parallel sentences. The key steps of our approach are illustrated in Figure 1.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 CLiCoTEA : Cross-Lingual Contextualised Token Embedding Alignment\",\"section_content\":\"We propose CLiCoTEA , an approach to transfer a monolingual vision-language (VL) pre-trained model in one language $L_{1}$ where there is an abundant number of training pairs of image and text (i.e., English) to a second language $L_{2}$ . As we focus in this paper on the zero-shot setting, we do the transfer after fne-tuning the pre-trained monolingual VL model on a downstream task $t$ , where training samples are available in language $L_{1}$ .\\nCLiCoTEA consists of six steps:\\n1. Pre-train a monolingual VL model on a massive collection of image-text pairs, where text is written in language $L_{1}$ .   \\n2. Fine-tune the VL pre-trained model on the downstream task $t$ in language $L1$ .   \\n3. Create a parallel text corpus by translating the training set from step 2 in the target language $L_{2}$ . Note that this step can be done automatically using neural machine translation.\\n4. Create a list of aligned tokens for each (potentially noisy) parallel sentence using a token alignment model.\\n5. Cross-lingual transfer by aligning contextualised token embeddings. As illustrated in Figure 1a, it transfers the VL fne-tuned model to the new language $L_{2}$ by aligning a pre-trained multilingual LM (e.g., mBERT or XLM-R) with the text encoder of the VL pre-trained model using the list of aligned tokens created in step 4.\\n6. Zero-shot transfer to $L_{2}$ by swapping the monolingual text encoder from the VL pretrained model with the aligned multilingual text encoder learned in step 5. An example of visual reasoning in Indonesian is illustrated in Figure 1b.\\nIn practice, steps 1 and 2 are the most computationally expensive. Therefore, we propose to adapt VL fne-tuned models to new languages by only doing the steps from 3 to 5 which can be computed in a few hours on a single GPU.\\nWe note that CLiCoTEA could be used with any multimodal pre-trained model where one of the modalities is a monolingual text encoder. We focus in this paper on VL models, but CLiCoTEA could be applied for instance to a language-knowledge model such as GreaseLM (Zhang et al., 2021) or DRAGON (Yasunaga et al., 2022).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Experiment\",\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Pre-trained Models\",\"section_content\":\"Vision-Language Model In step 1 of CLiCoTEA , we use the Align BEfore Fuse (ALBEF) framework1 (Li et al., 2021) as our Vision-Language Pre-trained Model (VLPM). ALBEF has been fne-tuned on multiple downstream VL tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We use the ALBEF fne-tuned models in step 2 for the downstream tasks described in Section 3.3. Unlike other competitive VL pre-trained models (such as BLIP (Li et al., 2022)) that inject visual information by inserting cross-attention for each transformer block of the text encoder, ALBEF frst encodes the image and text independently with a detector-free image encoder and a text encoder. Then it uses a multimodal encoder to fuse the image features with the text features through cross-modal attention. All encoders are based on transformer networks with the text encoder being a 6-layer transformer initialised using the frst 6 layers of the $\\\\mathrm{BERT_{base}}$ . We thus extract this 6-layer text encoder for cross-lingual transfer training in step 5.\\n\\nMultilingual Language Model As a multilingual pre-trained language model, we use the multilingual BERT (mBERT)2 (Devlin et al., 2018). It has been trained on the top 104 languages with the largest Wikipedia using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective and has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities (Wu and Dredze, 2019; Pires et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020; Conneau et al., 2018).

The generated word pairs are then fltered for keeping only one-to-one, oneto-many or many-to-one alignments and removing many-to-many alignments. This is done for all languages except Chinese because otherwise less than $3\\\\%$ of the training data would remain in the set. The advantage of this fltering is twofold: a) it removes the noise from the matching word pairs; b) it reduces the training time and computation. For words that are split into sub-word tokens, we consider either the left-most token embedding alignment (i.e., the frst sub-word token of a word) or, the average embedding across all sub-word tokens.\\nContextualised Token Alignment Training Given a set of aligned contextual word pairs extracted from parallel sentences, we defne $\\\\{\\\\mathrm{x}_{i},\\\\mathrm{y}_{i}\\\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ , where $\\\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the contextualised embedding of token $i$ in the target language (obtained from mBERT), and $\\\\mathrm{y}_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the contextualised embedding of its alignment in the source language (obtained from the fne-tuned ALBEF)4.

For each target language, the training is done on a single GeForce GTX TITAN X in a few hours.\\nData Augmentation As multilingual language models are generally pre-trained on the source language $L_{1}$ , the contextualised token alignment can be trained not only with sentences from the target language $L_{2}$ , but also with sentences from the source language $L_{1}$ . This strategy doubles the training size, and consequently, the training time but it could be used with tasks where the number of available training sentences is limited.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.3 Downstream Tasks\",\"section_content\":\"In step 6, we evaluate CLiCoTEA on three tasks from the IGLUE benchmark5 in the zero-shot setting:\\n\\u2022 xFlickr&CO: The dataset is composed of 1000 images from Flickr30K (Plummer et al., 2015) and 1000 images from MSCOCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014).
