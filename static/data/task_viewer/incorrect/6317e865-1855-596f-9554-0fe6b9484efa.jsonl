{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. IN THE RESPONSE, YOU SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN ONE TURN, THAT IS TO SAY, YOU SHOULD OUTPUT EXACTLY ONE THOUGHT AND ONTE ACTION. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Introduction\\nMachine learning (ML) models have demonstrated significant achievements in various areas [18, 38,\\n47, 23]. Still, they are inherently susceptible to distribution-shift [46, 13, 48, 21, 6] (also known as\\nthe divergence between the training and testing environments), leading to a significant degradation in\\nmodel performance. The ability to deviate from the conventional testing setting appears as a crucial\\naspect in boosting ML models\\u2019 adaptability when confronted with a new testing environment that\\nhas been investigated [30, 53, 14]. Among common domain generalization methods [58, 24, 1],\\ntest-time adaptation (TTA) takes the most challenging yet rewarding path that leverages unlabeled\\ndata available at test time for self-supervised adaptation prior to the final inference [57, 39, 8, 41, 59].\\nEarly TTA studies have concentrated on a simply ideal adaptation scenario where the test samples\\ncome from a fixed single domain [57, 39, 41]. As a result, such an assumption is far from the ever-\\nchanging and complex testing environments. To confront continually changing environments [59, 12],\\nYuan et al. [61] proposed a practical TTA scenario where distribution changing and correlative\\nsampling occur [15] simultaneously. Though practical TTA is more realistic than what the previous\\nassumptions have made, it still assumes that any environment only appears once in the data stream, a\\ncondition which does not hold true. Taking a surveillance camera as an example, it might accom-\\nmodate varying lighting conditions recurringly day after day (Fig. 1-left). Based on this reality, we\\nhypothesize that the recurring of those conditions may reveal the error accumulation phenomenon in\\nTTA, resulting in performance degradation over a long period. To verify our hypothesis, we simulate a\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nTesting Error\\nTime\\nDay 1\\nIllumination Condition\\nDay 2\\nDay 3\\n0\\n50\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n300\\n0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617181920\\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617181920\\nTest-time adaptation step\\nTesting Error\\nNo TTA\\nRoTTA\\nPeTTA (ours)\\nFigure 1: Recurring Test-time Adaption (TTA).

We showcase the testing error of RoTTA [61] after 20 cycles\\nof adaptation in Fig. 1-right. As expected, RoTTA can successfully adapt and deliver encouraging\\noutcomes within the first few passes. However, this advantage is short-lived as our study uncovers a\\nsignificant issue: TTA approaches in this setting may experience severe and persistent degradation in\\nperformance. Consequently, the testing error of RoTTA gradually escalates over time and quickly\\nsurpasses the model without adaptation. This result confirms the risk of TTA deployment in our\\nillustrative scenario, as an algorithm might work well in the first place and gradually degenerate.\\nTherefore, ensuring sustainable quality is crucial for real-world applications, especially given the\\nrecurring nature of testing environments.\\nThis study examines whether the adaptability of a TTA algorithm persists over an extended testing\\nstream. Specifically, in the most basic scenario, where the model returns to a previously encountered\\ntesting environment after undergoing various adjustments. We thus propose a more general testing\\nscenario than the practical TTA [61], namely recurring TTA, where the environments not only change\\ngradually but also recur in a correlated manner over time. We first analyze a simulation using the\\n\\u03f5\\u2212perturbed Gaussian Mixture Model Classifier (\\u03f5\\u2212GMMC) on a synthesized dataset and derive a\\ntheoretical analysis to confirm our findings, offering insights to tackle similar issues in deep neural\\nnetworks. The analysis provides hints for reasoning the success of many recent robust continual\\nTTA approaches [61, 12, 59, 15] and leading us to propose a simple yet effective baseline to avoid\\nperformance degradation, namely Persistent TTA (PeTTA). PeTTA continuously monitors the chance\\nof collapsing and adjusts the adaptation strategy on the fly, striking a balance between the two\\nobjectives: adaptation and collapse prevention. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 First, this work proposes a testing scenario - recurring TTA, a simple yet sufficient setup for\\ndiagnosing the overlooked gradual performance degradation phenomenon of TTA.\\n\\u2022 Second, we formally define the phenomenon of TTA collapsing and undertake a theoretical\\nanalysis on an \\u03f5-GMMC, shedding light on dataset-dependent and algorithm-dependent\\nfactors that contribute to the error accumulation during TTA processes.\\n\\u2022 Third, we introduce persistent TTA (PeTTA) - a simple yet effective adaptation scheme that\\nsurpasses all baseline models and demonstrates a persisting performance.\\nFor more context on related work, readers are directed to visit our discussions in Appdx.

We provide empirical and theoretical evidence on the risk\\nof deploying continual TTA algorithms. Existing studies fail to detect this issue with a single pass\\nper test set. The recurring TTA could be conveniently adopted as a straightforward evaluation, where\\nits challenging test stream magnifies the error accumulation that a model might encounter in practice.\\nLimitations.\\nPeTTA takes one step toward mitigating the gradual performance degradation of\\nTTA. Nevertheless, a complete elimination of error accumulation cannot be guaranteed rigorously\\nthrough regularization. Future research could delve deeper into expanding our efforts to develop\\nan algorithm that achieves error accumulation-free by construction. Furthermore, as tackling the\\nchallenge of the temporally correlated testing stream is not the focus of PeTTA, using a small memory\\nbank as in [61, 15] is necessary. It also assumes the features statistics from the source distribution are\\navailable (Appdx. E.3, E.4). These constraints potentially limit its scalability in real-world scenarios.\\nConclusion. Towards trustworthy and reliable TTA applications, we rigorously study the performance\\ndegradation problem of TTA. The proposed recurring TTA setting highlights the limitations of modern\\nTTA methods, which struggle to prevent the error accumulation when continuously adapting to\\ndemanding test streams. Theoretically inspecting a failure case of \\u03f5\\u2212GMMC paves the road for\\ndesigning PeTTA- a simple yet efficient solution that continuously assesses the model divergence for\\nharmonizing the TTA process, balancing adaptation, and collapse prevention.\\n10\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was supported by the Jump ARCHES Endowment through the Health Care Engineering Systems\\nCenter, JSPS\\/MEXT KAKENHI JP24K20830, ROIS NII Open Collaborative Research 2024-24S1201, in part\\nby the National Institute of Health (NIH) under Grant R01 AI139401, and in part by the Vingroup Innovation\\nFoundation under Grant VINIF.2021.DA00128.\\nReferences\\n[1] Kartik Ahuja, Ethan Caballero, Dinghuai Zhang, Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet, Yoshua Bengio, Ioannis\\nMitliagkas, and Irina Rish.
