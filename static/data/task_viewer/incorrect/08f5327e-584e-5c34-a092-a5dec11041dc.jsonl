{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Note that a straightforward solution is to directly regress camera pose parameters from the image tokens using an MLP decoder; however, such a naive solution lacks 3D inductive biases and, in our experiments (See Tab. 7), often leads to limited pose accuracy. Therefore, we propose to predict per-view coarse geometry (in the form of a sparse point cloud, i.e., predicting one 3D point for each patch token) that is supervised to be consistent with the NeRF geometry, allowing us to obtain the camera poses with a $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ solver given the 3D-2D correspondences from the per-patch predicted points and patch centers.\\nIn particular, from each image patch token output by the transformer $\\\\mathbf{\\\\delta}_{a_{i,j}}$ , we use an MLP to predict a 3D point and the prediction confidence:\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{\\\\phi}_{p_{i,j}}$ represents the 3D point location on the object seen through the central pixel of the image patch, $\\\\alpha_{i,j}$ is the pixel opacity that indicates if the pixel covers the foreground object, and $w_{i,j}$ is an additional confidence weight used to determine the point\\u2019s contribution to the $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ solver.\\nNote that in training, where the ground-truth camera poses are known, the central pixel\\u2019s point location and opacity can also be computed from a NeRF as done in previous work (Mildenhall et al., 2020). This allows us to enforce the consistency between the per-patch point estimates and the triplane NeRF geometry with following losses:\\nwhere $\\\\bar{\\\\pmb{x}}$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\tau}$ are computed along the pixel ray (marched from the ground-truth camera poses) using the volume rendering weights in Eqn. 3 by\\nwhere $\\\\tau_{k},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\delta_{k}$ follow the definition of Eqn. 3. Essentially, as we only use multi-view posed images to train our model without accessing 3D ground-truth, we distill the geometry of our learnt NeRF reconstruction to supervise our per-view point cloud prediction in an online manner. This online distillation is critical to stabilize the differentiable $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ loss mentioned later in Eq. 11; without it we find that the training tends to diverge in our experiments.\\nOnce $\\\\mathbf{\\\\phi}_{p_{i,j}}$ and $\\\\alpha_{i,j}$ are estimated, we can compute each pose $y_{i}$ with a weighted $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ solver as:\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{\\\\delta}_{q_{i,j}}$ is the 2D central pixel location of the patch, $[R_{i},t_{i}]$ are the rotation and translation of the pose $y_{i},\\\\mathcal{P}$ is the projection function with camera intrinsics involved. Here, the predicted opacity values are used to prevent the non-informative background points from affecting the pose prediction.\\nHowever, computing the solution of $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ is a non-convex problem prone to local minimas. Therefore, we further apply a robust differentiable $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ loss, proposed by EPro-PnP (Chen et al., 2022b) 1, to regularize our pose prediction, leading to much more accurate results (See Tab. 7). This loss is expressed by\\nwhere the first term minimizes the reprojection errors of the predicted points with the ground-truth poses and the second term minimizes the reprojection errors with the predicted pose distribution using Monte Carlo integral; we refer readers to the EPro-PnP paper (Chen et al., 2022b) for details.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Extended Brownian Bridge\",\"section_content\":\"In DialoGPS, given $X$ , a non-linear function $f_{\\\\theta}$ maps each $x_{t}$ to $\\\\mu_{t}$ , the expectations of the corresponding semantic distribution.

It mainly consists of two stages: relational semantic graph construction and semantic information refnement. The well-defned semantic graph is fed into a two-layer RGCN to compute semantic features of utterances and their interaction relations. Then the global semantic information is further extracted by a semantic graph-transformer.\\nSemantic Graph Construction: To establish semantic relations between the nearby utterances and to capture both inter-speaker and intra-speaker effects, we defne a semantic graph $G_{s}\\\\mathbf{=}~(V_{s},E_{s})$ based on the conversational semantic-aware dependency. Each utterance is represented by a node and different connection edges represent directed relations (past and future), $V_{s}$ denotes a set of utterance nodes, and $E_{s}\\\\subset V_{s}\\\\times V_{s}$ is a set of relations that represent the semantic similarity between the utterances, defned as Eq. (10).\\nWe defne intra-relations between the utterances spoken by the same speaker $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{R_{i n t r a}}&{{}\\\\in}\\\\end{array}$ $\\\\{U^{S i}\\\\to U^{S i}\\\\}$ and inter-relations by different speakers, $R_{i n t e r}\\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\{U^{S_{i}}\\\\rightarrow U^{S_{j}}\\\\}_{i\\\\not=j}$ We further consider a context window using $\\\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\\\mathcal{F}$ as hyperparameters to denote relations between the past $\\\\mathcal{P}$ utterances and future $\\\\mathcal{F}$ utterances for every utterance. The relational semantic graph can be regarded as a local-view modeling of the relationships between utterances in a dialogue and covering semantics features.\\n\\nSemantic Information Refnement: In this paper, a modifed relational graph convolution layer is adopted to capture local dependency defned by the relations. The node representations and edge weights are feed into a two-layer correlation-based RGCN which can be summarized as follows, here, we introduce the concept of aggregate functions to generalize the above mechanism:\\nwhere $N_{i}^{r}$ denotes the neighboring indices of each node under relation r \\u2208 R, W i(m) are learnable parameters, $\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot)$ is the activation function as ReLU. In this way, each graph convolution layer models the interaction between utterances, and refnes the semantic features.\\nThen, we adopt a semantic graph-transformer to extract global semantic information from the node feature taking in consideration the relative position of utterances (Fig. 4). It adopts the vanilla multihead attention into graph learning by taking into account nodes connected via edges. Given node features $H=[h_{1},h_{2},...,h_{n}]$ obtained from RGCN, we defne two encodings to represent semantic relationship between two nodes in a graph. The frst is relative position encoding $\\\\mathcal{P}$ , each vector of $\\\\mathcal{P}$ represents the topological relation represented by their shortest path distance between two nodes, the second is semantic encoding $\\\\mathcal{S}$ defned by Eq. (10), we take an addition operation and obtain $S\\\\mathcal{P}$ .\\nPrevious methods focus on encoding graph information into either the attention map or input features. First, our method encodes positional and semantic information represented by edge weight into attention map to take the global context structure into consideration. Moreover, it encodes the hidden features of value as shown in Eq. (14).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.4.1 NOISE ASSUMPTION\",\"section_content\":\"There is a concern about whether gradient clipping could lead to excessive texture detail loss, as observed in cases like linear approximation and PNGD.

In mathematical terms, we can assume that the gradient within the boundary is almost everywhere, with the region of being out-of-boundary having zero measure.

Note that a straightforward solution is to directly regress camera pose parameters from the image tokens using an MLP decoder; however, such a naive solution lacks 3D inductive biases and, in our experiments (See Tab. 7), often leads to limited pose accuracy. Therefore, we propose to predict per-view coarse geometry (in the form of a sparse point cloud, i.e., predicting one 3D point for each patch token) that is supervised to be consistent with the NeRF geometry, allowing us to obtain the camera poses with a $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ solver given the 3D-2D correspondences from the per-patch predicted points and patch centers.\\nIn particular, from each image patch token output by the transformer $\\\\mathbf{\\\\delta}_{a_{i,j}}$ , we use an MLP to predict a 3D point and the prediction confidence:\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{\\\\phi}_{p_{i,j}}$ represents the 3D point location on the object seen through the central pixel of the image patch, $\\\\alpha_{i,j}$ is the pixel opacity that indicates if the pixel covers the foreground object, and $w_{i,j}$ is an additional confidence weight used to determine the point\\u2019s contribution to the $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ solver.\\nNote that in training, where the ground-truth camera poses are known, the central pixel\\u2019s point location and opacity can also be computed from a NeRF as done in previous work (Mildenhall et al., 2020). This allows us to enforce the consistency between the per-patch point estimates and the triplane NeRF geometry with following losses:\\nwhere $\\\\bar{\\\\pmb{x}}$ and $\\\\bar{\\\\tau}$ are computed along the pixel ray (marched from the ground-truth camera poses) using the volume rendering weights in Eqn. 3 by\\nwhere $\\\\tau_{k},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\delta_{k}$ follow the definition of Eqn. 3. Essentially, as we only use multi-view posed images to train our model without accessing 3D ground-truth, we distill the geometry of our learnt NeRF reconstruction to supervise our per-view point cloud prediction in an online manner. This online distillation is critical to stabilize the differentiable $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ loss mentioned later in Eq. 11; without it we find that the training tends to diverge in our experiments.\\nOnce $\\\\mathbf{\\\\phi}_{p_{i,j}}$ and $\\\\alpha_{i,j}$ are estimated, we can compute each pose $y_{i}$ with a weighted $\\\\mathrm{PnP}$ solver as:\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{\\\\delta}_{q_{i,j}}$ is the 2D central pixel location of the patch, $[R_{i},t_{i}]$ are the rotation and translation of the pose $y_{i},\\\\mathcal{P}$ is the projection function with camera intrinsics involved.

It mainly consists of two stages: relational semantic graph construction and semantic information refnement. The well-defned semantic graph is fed into a two-layer RGCN to compute semantic features of utterances and their interaction relations. Then the global semantic information is further extracted by a semantic graph-transformer.\\nSemantic Graph Construction: To establish semantic relations between the nearby utterances and to capture both inter-speaker and intra-speaker effects, we defne a semantic graph $G_{s}\\\\mathbf{=}~(V_{s},E_{s})$ based on the conversational semantic-aware dependency. Each utterance is represented by a node and different connection edges represent directed relations (past and future), $V_{s}$ denotes a set of utterance nodes, and $E_{s}\\\\subset V_{s}\\\\times V_{s}$ is a set of relations that represent the semantic similarity between the utterances, defned as Eq.

The node representations and edge weights are feed into a two-layer correlation-based RGCN which can be summarized as follows, here, we introduce the concept of aggregate functions to generalize the above mechanism:\\nwhere $N_{i}^{r}$ denotes the neighboring indices of each node under relation r \\u2208 R, W i(m) are learnable parameters, $\\\\sigma(\\\\cdot)$ is the activation function as ReLU. In this way, each graph convolution layer models the interaction between utterances, and refnes the semantic features.\\nThen, we adopt a semantic graph-transformer to extract global semantic information from the node feature taking in consideration the relative position of utterances (Fig. 4). It adopts the vanilla multihead attention into graph learning by taking into account nodes connected via edges. Given node features $H=[h_{1},h_{2},...,h_{n}]$ obtained from RGCN, we defne two encodings to represent semantic relationship between two nodes in a graph.

For the sampling, we set the initial mesh normalized in $[-0.8,0.8]^{3}$ , focal range [0.7, 1.35], radius range [2.0, 2.5], elevation range $[-10^{\\\\circ},45^{\\\\circ}]$ and azimuth angle range $[0^{\\\\circ},360^{\\\\circ}]$ . In SDS, we set CFG 100, $t\\\\sim U(\\\\mathrm{0.02,0.5)}$ and $w(\\\\dot{t})=\\\\sigma_{t}^{2}$ . In PGC, we use PGC-N for PGC as default and set the threshold $c=0.1$ . The clipping threshold is studied in Section A.3.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Input: A differentiable parameterized policy function $\\\\pi(a|s,\\\\rho)$ Algorithm Parameters: step size $\\\\alpha>0$ , discount factor $\\\\gamma<1$ 1 Initialize $\\\\rho$ (e.g. $\\\\rho\\\\sim N(0,0.02))$ 2 for each episode do 3 Generate an episode 4 $s_{0},a_{0},r_{1},\\\\dots,s_{T-1},a_{T-1},r_{T}$ 5 following policy $\\\\pi$ 6 for each step in the episode ${\\\\bf\\\\nabla}^{\\\\prime}t$ from 0 to $T-1)$ do 7 $\\\\begin{array}{r}{G\\\\gets\\\\sum_{k=t+1}^{T}\\\\gamma^{k-t-1}r_{k}}\\\\end{array}$ 8 $\\\\rho\\\\gets\\\\rho+\\\\alpha\\\\gamma^{t}G\\\\nabla\\\\ln\\\\pi(a_{t}|s_{t},\\\\rho)$ 9 end\\n10 end\\nContinuous Action Spaces are one advantage of PG algorithms (Sutton and Barto, 2018). Parameterized policies allow action spaces that are parameterized by a probability distribution, such as a Gaussian. For Gaussian action spaces, the mean $\\\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\\\sigma$ are given by function approximators parameterized by $\\\\rho$ . For a state $s$ , an action $a$ is sampled from the distribution and the policy is updated according to Equation 5.\\n\\nKullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951) measures the similarity between two probability distributions $P$ and $Q$ . It is used in AVITM (Srivastava and Sutton, 2017) to force the posterior distribution parameterized by the VAE to be the Laplace approximation of the Dirichlet prior. The KL divergence calculation for $N$ topics is shown in Equation 6.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We select $V_{c l s}$ and $T_{c l s}$ produced by visual encoder and fusion-free text encoder to compute the loss of contrastive learning.
