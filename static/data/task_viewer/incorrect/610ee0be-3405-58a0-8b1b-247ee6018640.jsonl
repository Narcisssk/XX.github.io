{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development. Top usage scenarios include checking calendar, playing music, and asking about time, etc. We utilized the $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{hr}$ test set for evaluation.\\nEthical Considerations: We have reviewed all licenses of public datasets, which allow the usage for research and paper publication. The in-house dataset ConvAI is internally approved for research purposes. All datasets are sets are de-identifed to ensure anonymity. We also make sure the datasets cover various English accents, speakers and backgrounds.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We validate our methods on 10 datasets over 4 tasks, including quadruplet tasks, ASQP and ACOS, and triplet tasks, ASTE and TASD. For a fair comparison, we apply the same data splits as previous works. The targets of each task are shown in Table 1 and the detailed statistics are in Appendix A.\\nFor the ASQP task, we adopt two datasets in the restaurant domain based on SemEval tasks (Pontiki et al., 2015, 2016), Rest15 and Rest16 aligned and completed by Zhang et al. (2021a) subsequently. For the ACOS task, we apply Restaurant-ACOS and Laptop-ACOS constructed by Cai et al. (2021). Compared with ASQP, datasets of ACOS focus on implicit aspects and opinions, which helps to measure our methods comprehensively. For the triple tasks, we adopt datasets provided by Xu et al. (2020) and Wan et al. (2020) for ASTE (Peng et al., 2020) and TASD, respectively.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 7 shows the statistics of the three public benchmark datasets, including ACE05-E, ACE05- $\\\\mathrm{E+}$ and ERE-EN.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We construct a parallel dataset for Classical Chinese and Kanbun. The dataset consists of original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts. We show examples in Table 1.\\nAlthough it is crucial to choose texts that cover as many periods as possible since vocabulary and grammar change with time, it is diffcult to construct a comprehensive dataset. To our knowledge, Tangshixuan8 (Selection of Tang Poems) is the largest resource containing both original ancient Chinese texts and translated Kanbun texts. We use this resource to make our dataset. For preprocessing, we extract the Japanese reading order from Kanbun by a rule-based program. For the special tokens that may not appear in Kanbun or appear multiple times, we annotated them manually. We also convert the characters from old character forms to new character forms (kind of like transforming Traditional Chinese to Simplifed Chinese, but in Japanese character forms) using dictionaries to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem.\\nTangshixuan contains a total of 465 poems. We split the dataset using group shuffe split to ensure that all sentences in one poem would not be split. Table 2 lists the statistics of the dataset.\\nBased on the dataset, we introduce two tasks, character reordering and machine translation, both of which are signifcant in Kanbun comprehension. For character reordering, the goal is to transform Classical Chinese texts into Japanese reading orders, from SVO to SOV. Japanese reading orders as\\nTable 1: Examples of our dataset. Each instance has a triple of the original ancient Chinese text, the Japanese reading order (the numbers represent their index in the original text), and the translated Kanbun text.\\nshown in Table 1, such as \\u201c12543\\u201d, are the targets to be predicted. Machine translation is a sequenceto-sequence task that translates Classical Chinese texts into Kanbun. Since the source and target sentences share the vocabulary, it can also be considered as a multilingual rewriting task.\\nWe split each sentence into characters and preprocess them into inputs by the form {character}{the character\\u2019s index in the sentence}[SEP]{sentence}. The character\\u2019s index is added to handle the cases where more than two identical characters appear in one sentence. To make gold labels for training, we normalize the ranks by the lengths of the sentences, making the value of ranks range from 0 to 1 (for a sentence of length 5, the ranks will be normalized from 1, 2, ..., 5 to 0.2, 0.4, ..., 1). Once we collect the output ranks, we sort them in ascending order and restore them to the original characters. Then we obtain a reordered sentence. An illustration of our sorting method is shown in (A) of Figure 2.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Details of Dataset\\nTo train the visual text generation model, we constructed a dataset called TG-2M, which contains rich\\ntextual data.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"DATASETS WITH DIVERSE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IMITATION LEARNING\\nIn this section, we present a novel suite of tasks known as D3IL - Datasets with Diverse Demon-\\nstrations for Imitation Learning. We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development. Top usage scenarios include checking calendar, playing music, and asking about time, etc. We utilized the $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{hr}$ test set for evaluation.\\nEthical Considerations: We have reviewed all licenses of public datasets, which allow the usage for research and paper publication. The in-house dataset ConvAI is internally approved for research purposes. All datasets are sets are de-identifed to ensure anonymity. We also make sure the datasets cover various English accents, speakers and backgrounds.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 7 shows the statistics of the three public benchmark datasets, including ACE05-E, ACE05- $\\\\mathrm{E+}$ and ERE-EN.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The detailed statistics are shown in Table 1.\\nFingerspelling LibriSpeech To extract semantic units from the fngerspelling signs, we trained the visual CPC encoder on a sentence-level fngerspelling dataset constructed from the 960-hour LibriSpeech dataset and the Unvoiced dataset (Nagaraj, 2018).

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development. Top usage scenarios include checking calendar, playing music, and asking about time, etc. We utilized the $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{hr}$ test set for evaluation.\\nEthical Considerations: We have reviewed all licenses of public datasets, which allow the usage for research and paper publication. The in-house dataset ConvAI is internally approved for research purposes. All datasets are sets are de-identifed to ensure anonymity. We also make sure the datasets cover various English accents, speakers and backgrounds.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We validate our methods on 10 datasets over 4 tasks, including quadruplet tasks, ASQP and ACOS, and triplet tasks, ASTE and TASD. For a fair comparison, we apply the same data splits as previous works.

(2021a) subsequently. For the ACOS task, we apply Restaurant-ACOS and Laptop-ACOS constructed by Cai et al. (2021). Compared with ASQP, datasets of ACOS focus on implicit aspects and opinions, which helps to measure our methods comprehensively. For the triple tasks, we adopt datasets provided by Xu et al. (2020) and Wan et al. (2020) for ASTE (Peng et al., 2020) and TASD, respectively.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 7 shows the statistics of the three public benchmark datasets, including ACE05-E, ACE05- $\\\\mathrm{E+}$ and ERE-EN.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We construct a parallel dataset for Classical Chinese and Kanbun. The dataset consists of original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts. We show examples in Table 1.\\nAlthough it is crucial to choose texts that cover as many periods as possible since vocabulary and grammar change with time, it is diffcult to construct a comprehensive dataset. To our knowledge, Tangshixuan8 (Selection of Tang Poems) is the largest resource containing both original ancient Chinese texts and translated Kanbun texts. We use this resource to make our dataset. For preprocessing, we extract the Japanese reading order from Kanbun by a rule-based program. For the special tokens that may not appear in Kanbun or appear multiple times, we annotated them manually. We also convert the characters from old character forms to new character forms (kind of like transforming Traditional Chinese to Simplifed Chinese, but in Japanese character forms) using dictionaries to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem.\\nTangshixuan contains a total of 465 poems. We split the dataset using group shuffe split to ensure that all sentences in one poem would not be split. Table 2 lists the statistics of the dataset.\\nBased on the dataset, we introduce two tasks, character reordering and machine translation, both of which are signifcant in Kanbun comprehension. For character reordering, the goal is to transform Classical Chinese texts into Japanese reading orders, from SVO to SOV. Japanese reading orders as\\nTable 1: Examples of our dataset.

Machine translation is a sequenceto-sequence task that translates Classical Chinese texts into Kanbun. Since the source and target sentences share the vocabulary, it can also be considered as a multilingual rewriting task.\\nWe split each sentence into characters and preprocess them into inputs by the form {character}{the character\\u2019s index in the sentence}[SEP]{sentence}. The character\\u2019s index is added to handle the cases where more than two identical characters appear in one sentence. To make gold labels for training, we normalize the ranks by the lengths of the sentences, making the value of ranks range from 0 to 1 (for a sentence of length 5, the ranks will be normalized from 1, 2, ..., 5 to 0.2, 0.4, ..., 1). Once we collect the output ranks, we sort them in ascending order and restore them to the original characters. Then we obtain a reordered sentence. An illustration of our sorting method is shown in (A) of Figure 2.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Details of Dataset\\nTo train the visual text generation model, we constructed a dataset called TG-2M, which contains rich\\ntextual data.

We use F1 scores as the main evaluation metrics (Zhang et al., 2021a; Mao et al., 2022). All reported F1 scores are averaged over 5 runs with different random seeds. For multi-task settings, we use a different split of the training and development sets in each run.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We frst evaluate the performance of the scoring model by measuring how well it distinguishes the correct and incorrect argument role predictions from an event extraction model. Specifcally, we compute event predictions by running a fully trained event extraction model (i.e., OneIE or AMR-IE) on the validation and test sets of the three benchmark datasets. Based on the gold event annotations, we create a gold binary label (correct or incorrect) for each argument role prediction to indicate its correctness. For each event prediction, we pass it along with the corresponding AMR graph of the source sentence into the scoring model. If the correctness16 predicted by the scoring model agrees with the gold binary label, we treat it as a true prediction for scoring model, otherwise, a false prediction.\\nTo examine the impact of leveraging AMR in scoring model performance, we develop a baseline scoring model that shares the same structure with our proposed scoring model except that it does not take an AMR graph as an input. Specifcally, the baseline scoring model just takes the event mention (triggers, arguments and argument labels) in order to measure the compatibility score. The baseline scoring model is essentially an ablation of our scoring model where the AMR path is absent. As shown in Table 2, the performance of our scoring model outperforms the baseline scoring model by 1.4-1.7 F-score on the test sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graph in characterizing the correctness of each event prediction.\\nIn Table 1, we can observe that the semantics and structure of AMR paths can be easily mapped to argument role types. Sometimes, the even triggers are far from their arguments in plain text, but the AMR paths between them is short and informative. Another observation is that the scoring model tends to assign positive scores to argument roles that are more compatible with the AMR paths, although sometimes the scores for the gold argument roles are not the highest.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 3 shows the event extraction results of both our approach and strong baselines17. For clarity, in the rest of the section, we refer to our proposed framework as STFAMR and our proposed framework with the baseline scoring model as STFW\\/O_AMR. We can see that, both STFAMR and STFW\\/O_AMR improve the performance of the event extraction models on argument role classifcation while the vanilla self-training and GradLRE barely work, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging the feedback to the pseudo labels during selftraining.\\nWe further analyze the reasons in terms of why the vanilla self-training and GradLRE do not work and notice that: due to the data scarcity, the base event extraction model (i.e., OneIE) performs poorly on many argument roles (lower than $40\\\\%$ F-score). Thus, the event predictions on unlabeled corpora can be very noisy and inaccurate. The model suffers from confrmation bias (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017; Arazo et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020): it accumulates errors and diverges when it\\u2019s iteratively trained on such noisy pseudo labeled examples during self-training. In addition, we also notice that with self-training, the event extraction model becomes overconfdent about its predictions. We check the averaged probability of all the argument role predictions on the unlabeled dataset which is 0.93. In such case, it is clear that the predicted probability can not faithfully refect the correctness of the predictions, which is referred as the calibration error (Guo et al., 2017; NiculescuMizil and Caruana, 2005). Thus, the self-training process which relies on overconfdent prediction can become highly biased and diverge from the initial baseline model. In GradLRE, the quality of the reward is highly depend on the averaged gradient direction computed during the supervised training process. However, due to the scarcity of the training data, the stored gradient direction can be unreliable. In addition, the gradient computed on the pseudo-labeled dataset with high reward is used to update the average gradient direction, which can introduce noises into the reward function. As seen in Table 3, the best models of self-training and GradLRE are on par or worse than the baseline approach, and these approaches show the detrimental effects as they show a continuous decline of the performance as training proceeds.\\n\\nBy considering AMR structure, STFAMR encourages the event extraction models to predict event structures that are more compatible with AMR graphs. This claim is supported by Table 4, which compares the compatibility scores between the model without STF (OneIE baseline) and one with STF (OneIE $+{\\\\bf S}\\\\mathrm{TF}$ ) framework on the three benchmark datasets. The compatibility scores are measured by the AMR based scoring models. We can clearly see that the compatibility scores measured on OneIE+STFAMR are much higher than the scores measured on base OneIE.\\nLastly, we observe that OneIE+STFAMR outperforms AMR-IE $^{,+}$ STFAMR, even when AMR-IE performs better than OneIE baseline without STF. We argue the reason is that even though STFAMR does not need AMR parsing at inference time, AMRIE does require AMR graphs at inference time which causes it to suffer from potential errors in the AMR parsing. On the other hand, OneIE trained by STFAMR does not require AMR graphs at inference time, making it free from potential error propagation. Figure 2 shows more examples to illustrate how the feedback from AMR structures in STF helps to improve event predictions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To gain a deeper understanding of cTBLS, we conducted human evaluation using the metrics outlined by Nakamura et al. (2022), namely Coherence, Fluency, and Informativeness. For the evaluation of these metrics, we enlisted crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess $50\\\\%$ of the test data. The evaluation process involved a comparison between the responses generated by HYBRIDIALOGUE and cTBLS Top-3.\\nIn accordance with the methodology delineated in Nakamura et al. (2022), Coherence was defned as the degree to which a response continued the conversation in a logically coherent manner based on prior context. Fluency, conversely, was determined by evaluating absence of grammatical and spelling errors, and appropriate use of parts of speech.\\nTo ensure the quality of the evaluated responses, we engaged crowd workers possessing a Masters qualifcation on AMT and originating from Englishspeaking countries (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Great Britain). Each task required approximately 30 seconds to complete, and workers were remunerated at a rate of $\\\\mathbb{S}0.05$ per task. Moreover, to minimize bias and guarantee the dependability of the evaluations, we assigned two crowd workers to assess each response, with a response deemed more coherent or fuent only if both evaluations concurred.\\nThe results presented in Table 5 reveal that the responses generated by cTBLS Top-3 were more coherent than those produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE in $84.2\\\\%$ of cases and exhibited greater fuency $82.7\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that improvements in table retrieval, knowledge retrieval, and response generation lead to better downstream performance.\\nInformativeness represents the accuracy of machine-generated responses when compared to the ground-truth (Nakamura et al., 2022) and serves as a measure of hallucination in LLMs. Hallucinated responses tend to be less informative, deviating signifcantly from the ground-truth.\\nTo evaluate informativeness, crowd workers determined whether generated responses were semantically equivalent to the ground truth response. Each response was assessed by two Turkers, and a response was deemed more informative only if there was inter-annotator agreement. The absence of illustrative examples in the prompting process resulted in responses generated by cTBLS Top-1 and cTBLS Top-3 being longer than the ground truth response. Consequently, the knowledge-augmented cTBLS responses were considered informative if all the information provided in the ground truth was encapsulated in the model response, even if cTBLS included supplementary information.\\n\\nThe data in Table 6 indicate that cTBLS Top-3 encompasses the same information as the ground truth response $50\\\\%$ of the time, a higher rate than cTBLS Top-1 at $45.6\\\\%$ , exemplifying the benefts of partitioning retrieval into coarse and fne state tracking and augmenting with additional knowledge. Based on these fndings, we hypothesize that the attention mechanism in decoder models facilitates additional knowledge retrieval. cTBLS NoK generates the correct response $30.6\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that HYBRIDIALOGUE comprises questions and answers predicated on general world knowledge embedded in the weights of LLMs. Responses produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE are informative in merely $12.4\\\\%$ of instances.\\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of responses generated by various confgurations of cTBLS on the HYBRIDIALOGUE dataset. The entire dialogue history constitutes the context and is depicted as an exchange between the user (in blue) and the system (in yellow). The fnal question box represents the follow-up query to be addressed, while the last answer chat box indicates the ground truth response. Knowledge K1, K2, and K3 correspond to cells of the table retrieved during state tracking, based on which responses are produced. cTBLS NoK generates a response solely relying on the context, cTBLS Top-1 formulates a response conditioned on K1, and cTBLS Top-3 devises a response based on K1, K2, and K3.\\ncTBLS NoK creates a hallucinated response, answering with the random Faroese club B68 Toftir. Similarly, cTBLS Top-1 hallucinates a response, opting for B36 T\\u00f3rshavn, as K1 refers to the stadium Vi\\u00f2 Marg\\u00e1ir rather than the correct club\\u2019s name. In contrast, cTBLS Top-3 produces the accurate response, EB\\/Streymur, since K3 contains the necessary information. This example demonstrates the benefts of augmenting response generation with additional pertinent knowledge, which aids in mitigating the hallucination problem (Maynez et al., 2020).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Evaluation details\\nE.1\\nSynthetic tasks\\nWe implement our neural process by modifying the Llama 2 architecture [42] to model sequences of\\ncontinuous variables.

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development. Top usage scenarios include checking calendar, playing music, and asking about time, etc. We utilized the $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{hr}$ test set for evaluation.\\nEthical Considerations: We have reviewed all licenses of public datasets, which allow the usage for research and paper publication. The in-house dataset ConvAI is internally approved for research purposes. All datasets are sets are de-identifed to ensure anonymity.

On some datasets, a simple virtual node is enough to achieve state-\\nof-the-art performance when compared to graph transformers. While these experiments are more\\nloosely related to our theoretical results, they offer another view leading to the general message:\\nNeither GPS nor MPGNN+VN performs strictly better than the other across all learning tasks and a\\nbroad range of architectures should generally be considered.\\n5.1\\nSYNTHETIC EXPERIMENTS\\nMPGNN+VN \\u2270\\n\\u2270\\n\\u2270GPS From Corollary 4.4 we know that the simple function where the value |V |2\\nhas to be predicted as a graph-level regression target can be uniformly expressed by an MPGNN\\nwith VN but not by a Graph Transformer. In order to verify this empirically, we designed a dataset\\nconsisting of 100k random graphs with size 10 \\u2264|V | \\u226450. For testing, we use larger graphs of\\nsize up to 200 as we are interested in the generalization behavior of the trained models. We train\\nMPGNN+VN and GPS architectures that are identical in width (256 hidden dimensions) and depth\\n(3 layers). For both models we use a standard GCN layer (Kipf & Welling, 2017) as a message\\npassing module. To the GPS model, we additionally provide LapPE encodings. Figure 2a shows the\\nresults on the test data. MPGNN+VN has learned to perfectly predict the target function even for\\ngraphs outside the training distribution. GPS does achieve a low relative error for graphs with size at\\nmost 50. However, for sizes unseen during training the performance deteriorates rapidly. Thus, GPS\\nwas unable to learn a function that generalizes across graph sizes which is in line with Corollary 4.4.\\nGPS \\u2270\\n\\u2270\\n\\u2270MPGNN+VN To empirically study the converse scenario, we generate another synthetic\\ndataset consisting of 100k random graphs Gl,r as defined in the beginning of Section 4.3 with the\\ntarget function being the graph-level regression target h(Gl, r) from Section 4.3. During training,\\nwe restrict the data distribution to l \\u2208[1, 10] and r \\u2208[1, 5] and increase the range to l, r \\u2208[1, 50] for\\ntesting. Again, we train 3-layer MPGNN+VN and GPS models based on GCN layers of identical\\nwidth. Figure 2b provides the experiment\\u2019s results. For both models the MAE increases roughly\\nlinearly in both l and r. The error of the MPGNN+VN model increases around twice as quickly as\\nthat of the GPS model which generalizes better to values of r and l outside the training distribution\\nwhich aligns with Corollary 4.9.\\nThrough the synthetic experiments, we showed that the theoretical findings from Section 4 extend\\nto practice. Especially in the first case, we observe that a simple function on the number of nodes of\\na graph was not learned robustly by GPS but was learned by the uniformly expressive MPGNN+VN\\narchitecture.\\n5.2\\nEXPERIMENTS ON BENCHMARK DATASETS\\nFinally, we compare MPGNN+VNs to Graph Transformers to contrast the two paradigms of global\\ninformation exchange.

We thus use their updated baseline results on LRGB.\\nResults Our results are provided in Table 1. We can see that on the peptides datasets, and especially\\npeptides-struct, all models are very close and neither Graph Transformers nor MPGNNs with virtual\\nnodes hold a significant edge over simple MPGNNs. On the superpixel datasets PascalVOC-SP\\nand COCO-SP the performance of MPGNNs is significantly strengthened by adding a virtual node.\\nOn PascalVOC-SP the GatedGCN+VN model is on par with GPS, indicating that the virtual node\\nyields similar performance benefits as the self-attention in GPS which also relies on GatedGCN\\nas its message passing module on this dataset. On COCO-SP the improvement of adding a VN\\nto MPGNNs is also significant, although not enough to fully close the gap to GPS. The results on\\nogbg-code2 are similar and adding virtual nodes to MPGNNs significantly boosts the performance\\nto almost the level of the GTs. Last, we provide new results for GatedGCN on ogbg-molpcba (with\\nand without virtual nodes) and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Here, virtual nodes were able\\nto further boost the already very good performance of GatedGCN by about 1% AP which is a highly\\nsignificant gain over all other methods and even reaches the level of Graphormer (not shown) which\\nwas pretrained on additional data.\\nOverall, the comparison yields mixed results with neither Graph Transformers nor MPGNNs+VN\\nclearly outperforming the other. This adds to our main theoretical results which state that nei-\\nther architecture subsumes the other in terms of uniform expressivity. Furthermore, MPGNNs+VN\\ndo yield the best results on some datasets, showing that virtual nodes can generally compete with\\nself-attention as a means of global information exchange on real-world learning tasks while being\\nsignificantly more efficient.\\n6\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

On some datasets, a simple virtual node is enough to achieve state-\\nof-the-art performance when compared to graph transformers. While these experiments are more\\nloosely related to our theoretical results, they offer another view leading to the general message:\\nNeither GPS nor MPGNN+VN performs strictly better than the other across all learning tasks and a\\nbroad range of architectures should generally be considered.\\n5.1\\nSYNTHETIC EXPERIMENTS\\nMPGNN+VN \\u2270\\n\\u2270\\n\\u2270GPS From Corollary 4.4 we know that the simple function where the value |V |2\\nhas to be predicted as a graph-level regression target can be uniformly expressed by an MPGNN\\nwith VN but not by a Graph Transformer. In order to verify this empirically, we designed a dataset\\nconsisting of 100k random graphs with size 10 \\u2264|V | \\u226450. For testing, we use larger graphs of\\nsize up to 200 as we are interested in the generalization behavior of the trained models. We train\\nMPGNN+VN and GPS architectures that are identical in width (256 hidden dimensions) and depth\\n(3 layers). For both models we use a standard GCN layer (Kipf & Welling, 2017) as a message\\npassing module. To the GPS model, we additionally provide LapPE encodings. Figure 2a shows the\\nresults on the test data. MPGNN+VN has learned to perfectly predict the target function even for\\ngraphs outside the training distribution. GPS does achieve a low relative error for graphs with size at\\nmost 50. However, for sizes unseen during training the performance deteriorates rapidly. Thus, GPS\\nwas unable to learn a function that generalizes across graph sizes which is in line with Corollary 4.4.\\nGPS \\u2270\\n\\u2270\\n\\u2270MPGNN+VN To empirically study the converse scenario, we generate another synthetic\\ndataset consisting of 100k random graphs Gl,r as defined in the beginning of Section 4.3 with the\\ntarget function being the graph-level regression target h(Gl, r) from Section 4.3. During training,\\nwe restrict the data distribution to l \\u2208[1, 10] and r \\u2208[1, 5] and increase the range to l, r \\u2208[1, 50] for\\ntesting. Again, we train 3-layer MPGNN+VN and GPS models based on GCN layers of identical\\nwidth. Figure 2b provides the experiment\\u2019s results. For both models the MAE increases roughly\\nlinearly in both l and r. The error of the MPGNN+VN model increases around twice as quickly as\\nthat of the GPS model which generalizes better to values of r and l outside the training distribution\\nwhich aligns with Corollary 4.9.\\nThrough the synthetic experiments, we showed that the theoretical findings from Section 4 extend\\nto practice. Especially in the first case, we observe that a simple function on the number of nodes of\\na graph was not learned robustly by GPS but was learned by the uniformly expressive MPGNN+VN\\narchitecture.\\n5.2\\nEXPERIMENTS ON BENCHMARK DATASETS\\nFinally, we compare MPGNN+VNs to Graph Transformers to contrast the two paradigms of global\\ninformation exchange. For this, we evaluate MPGNN+VNs on real-world benchmark datasets from\\nboth the recent LRGB collection (Dwivedi et al., 2022) and OGB (Hu et al., 2020a).

Details on the datasets are given in the appendix. We note that on LRGB\\nT\\u00a8\\nonshoff et al. (2023) very recently showed that the original baseline results reported by Dwivedi\\net al. (2022) and Ramp\\u00b4\\na\\u02c7\\nsek et al. (2022) suffered from suboptimal hyperparameters and lack of\\nfeature normalization. We thus use their updated baseline results on LRGB.\\nResults Our results are provided in Table 1. We can see that on the peptides datasets, and especially\\npeptides-struct, all models are very close and neither Graph Transformers nor MPGNNs with virtual\\nnodes hold a significant edge over simple MPGNNs. On the superpixel datasets PascalVOC-SP\\nand COCO-SP the performance of MPGNNs is significantly strengthened by adding a virtual node.\\nOn PascalVOC-SP the GatedGCN+VN model is on par with GPS, indicating that the virtual node\\nyields similar performance benefits as the self-attention in GPS which also relies on GatedGCN\\nas its message passing module on this dataset. On COCO-SP the improvement of adding a VN\\nto MPGNNs is also significant, although not enough to fully close the gap to GPS. The results on\\nogbg-code2 are similar and adding virtual nodes to MPGNNs significantly boosts the performance\\nto almost the level of the GTs. Last, we provide new results for GatedGCN on ogbg-molpcba (with\\nand without virtual nodes) and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Here, virtual nodes were able\\nto further boost the already very good performance of GatedGCN by about 1% AP which is a highly\\nsignificant gain over all other methods and even reaches the level of Graphormer (not shown) which\\nwas pretrained on additional data.\\nOverall, the comparison yields mixed results with neither Graph Transformers nor MPGNNs+VN\\nclearly outperforming the other. This adds to our main theoretical results which state that nei-\\nther architecture subsumes the other in terms of uniform expressivity. Furthermore, MPGNNs+VN\\ndo yield the best results on some datasets, showing that virtual nodes can generally compete with\\nself-attention as a means of global information exchange on real-world learning tasks while being\\nsignificantly more efficient.\\n6\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
