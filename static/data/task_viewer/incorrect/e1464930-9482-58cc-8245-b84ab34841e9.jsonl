{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved by a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -- employing a frozen transformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to directly process visual tokens. Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks} encompassing pure 2D or 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D\\/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks. We additionally propose the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding -- the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern informative visual tokens and further amplify their effect. This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions. We hope that our work inspires new perspectives on utilizing LLMs and deepening our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Discussion\\nWe present NAVSIM, a framework for non-reactive AV simulation. We address shortcomings of\\nexisting driving benchmarks and propose standardized but configurable simulation-based metrics for\\nbenchmarking driving policies. For accessibility, we provide challenging scenario splits and simple\\ndata curation methods. We show that our evaluation protocol is better aligned to closed-loop driving,\\nbenchmark an established set of end-to-end planning baselines from CARLA and nuScenes, and\\npresent the results of our inaugural competition. We hope that NAVSIM can serve as an accessible\\ntoolkit for AV researchers that bridges the gap between simulated and real-world driving.\\nNeed for Reactive Simulation. While we show improvements over displacement errors, several\\naspects of driving remain unaddressed by evaluation in NAVSIM. A high PDMS does not always imply\\na high CLS, since our framework does not consider reactiveness or the compounding accumulation\\n2https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/spaces\\/AGC2024-P\\/e2e-driving-navsim\\n9\\nof errors in closed-loop simulation. Moreover, as in CLS, rear-end collisions into the ego vehicle\\nare currently not classified as \\\"at-fault\\\", resulting in little importance given to the scene behind the\\nvehicle in NAVSIM. In the future, data-driven sensor or traffic simulation could alleviate these issues,\\nonce such methods mature and become computationally tractable. Given these limitations of the\\ncurrent framework, we strongly encourage the use of graphics-based closed-loop simulators, such as\\nCARLA [17], as complementary benchmarks to NAVSIM when developing planning algorithms.\\nSimplicity of Metrics. As a starting point, NAVSIM offers both interpretable open-loop subscores\\nand a scalarizing function, which lets us provide a final score and ranking for participants in the\\nchallenge. In the future, multi-objective evaluation and other aggregation functions might be required.\\nMoreover, closed-loop metrics also face problems, i.e., PDMS inherits several weaknesses of nuPlan\\u2019s\\nCLS. Both scores do not regard certain traffic rules (e.g., stop-sign or traffic light compliance) or\\nconcepts such as transit and fuel efficiency. In the future, we aim to improve the subscore definitions\\n(e.g. the at-fault collision logic) and add more subscores during aggregation.\\nCall for Datasets. Certain limitations of the nuPlan dataset persist in NAVSIM, such as missing\\nclasses in the label space, minor errors in camera parameters, or noise in vehicle poses and 3D\\nannotations. Our analysis might favor methods that are robust to such inconsistencies. In addition,\\nthe lack of road elevation data in our representation presents a challenge for integrating scenarios\\nbased on 3D map annotations. We aim to support more datasets in the future, and advocate for more\\nopen dataset releases by the community for accelerating progress in autonomous driving.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the ERC Starting Grant LEGO-3D (850533), the DFG EXC number\\n2064\\/1 - project number 390727645, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research:\\nT\\u00fcbingen AI Center, FKZ: 01IS18039A and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs\\nand Climate Action within the project NXT GEN AI METHODS.

(a) For each planner, we show open-loop metrics (OLS, PDMS)\\ntogether with the corresponding closed-loop score (CLS). The trendlines depicting correlations are fit\\nlinearly to all (learned and rule-based) planners. Moreover, we analyze different (b) CLS durations d,\\n(c) planning frequencies f, (d) PDMS horizons h, and (e) closed-loop background agent behaviors.\\n4.1\\nAlignment Between Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Evaluation\\nOpen-loop metrics should ideally be aligned with closed-loop metrics in their evaluation of different\\ndriving algorithms. In this section, we benchmark a large set of planners to analyze the alignment of\\nclosed-loop metrics with traditional distance-based open-loop metrics and the proposed PDMS.\\nBenchmark. Studying the relation of closed-loop and open-loop metrics necessitates access to a\\nfully reactive simulator. To stay compatible with the dataset, we use the nuPlan simulator [26], which\\nenables simulation for privileged planners with access to ground-truth perception and HD map inputs.\\nSimilar to PDMS, nuPlan combines weighted averages and multiplied penalties in two official scores:\\nthe open-loop score (OLS) aggregates displacement and heading errors with a multiplied miss-rate,\\nand the closed-loop score (CLS) implements similar metrics from Section 3. Including PDMS, all\\nmetrics are in [0, 1] with higher scores indicating better performance.\\nDue to the heavy computational requirements of closed-loop simulation, we evaluate on the navmini\\nsplit. This is a new split we create for rapid testing, with 396 scenarios in total that are independent of\\nboth navtrain and navtest but filtered using the same strategy (Section 3.1) and hence similarly\\ndistributed. We note that nuPlan offers two kinds of background agents: reactive agents along lane\\ncenters based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [48], and non-reactive agents replayed from the\\ndataset, which we employ unless otherwise stated. While reactive simulations of longer or dynamic\\nlengths are generally desirable, e.g. to evaluate long-term decisions, enabling this requires dedicated\\nsolutions to long-horizon simulation that are not currently available in nuPlan [13]. Therefore, we\\ndefault to a fixed closed-loop simulation duration of d = 15s, and a planning frequency of f = 10Hz,\\nwhich are the standard closed-loop simulation settings in nuPlan [26].\\nMotion Planners. Open-loop metrics favor learned planners while rule-based approaches perform\\nwell in closed-loop evaluation in nuPlan [16]. We use a combination of both planner types in this\\nexperiment to cover different performance levels. In total, we include 37 rule-based planners with 2\\nconstant velocity and 8 constant acceleration models, 15 IDM planners [48], and 12 PDM-Closed\\nvariants [16] which differ in hyperparameters for trajectory generation. For learned planning, we\\nevaluate Urban Driver models [42] of 2 model sizes and 2 training lengths, and PlanCNN [38] models\\nwith 15 input combinations of the BEV raster, ego status, centerline, and navigation goal. We train\\nall models on {25%, 50%, 100%} of navtrain and an equally sized uniformly sampled subset of\\nOpenScene, giving 114 learned planners. See the supplementary material for additional details.\\nResults. The alignment between metrics is presented in Fig. 3 (a-e).

Relying on the ego status is insufficient for competitive results. While\\nsensor agents improve, the gap to human performance highlights our benchmark\\u2019s challenges.\\nproperties of both learned and rule-based planners, whereas distance-based open-loop metrics show\\na clear misalignment. Decreasing the CLS duration in (b) from d = 15s to d = 4s further raises\\nthe correlation of PDMS and OLS, as the simulation horizon more closely matches the open-loop\\ncounterparts. Interestingly, we observe a higher correlation of open-loop metrics in (c) when reducing\\nthe planning frequency to 2Hz. We expect a lower planning frequency to mitigate cumulative errors\\nand enhance the controller\\u2019s stability in simulation, leading to more precise trajectory execution.\\nMoreover, we observe an increase in correlation for longer PDMS horizons in (d), ranging from\\nh = 2s to h = 8s. While predicting the future motion over 8s is challenging in uncertain scenarios,\\nour results indicate the value of long horizons when evaluating motion planners. Lastly, replacing the\\nnon-reactive background agents with reactive IDM vehicles during closed-loop simulation in (e) has\\nlittle effect on the correlation, possibly due to the similar difficulty of both tasks [16].\\nThe imbalanced distribution of different types of planners in our study may introduce biases into\\nthe overall correlations presented in Fig. 3. To address this, we visualize the individual correlations\\nof each planner type in Fig. 4. The correlation values vary depending on metric range and variance\\nof each planner type. Nevertheless, when examining each type individually, the PDMS is better\\ncorrelated to the CLS than the OLS, and is always positively correlated.\\n4.2\\nAnalysis of the State of the Art in End-to-End Autonomous Driving\\nIn this section, we benchmark a collection of end-to-end architectures, which previously achieved\\nstate-of-the-art performance on existing open- or closed-loop benchmarks.\\nMethods. As a lower bound, we consider the (1) Constant Velocity baseline detailed in Section 3.1.\\nWe include an (2) Ego Status MLP as a second \\\"blind\\\" agent, which leverages an MLP for trajectory\\nprediction given only the ego velocity, acceleration and navigation goal. As an established architecture\\non CARLA, we evaluate our reimplementation of (3) TransFuser [12], which uses three cropped\\nand downscaled forward-facing cameras, concatenated into a 1024 \\u00d7 256 image, and a rasterized\\nBEV LiDAR input for predicting waypoints. It performs 3D object detection and BEV semantic\\nsegmentation as auxiliary tasks.

The default configuration, which obtains the best results, uses the\\nnavigation goal, velocity, and acceleration as ego status inputs. Its camera FOV is around 140\\u25e6and\\nLiDAR range is 32m to the front (F), back (B), left (L), and right (R). It uses both auxiliary tasks.\\nthe same architecture as TransFuser but replaces the LiDAR input with a learned embedding, hence\\nrequiring only camera inputs. Moreover, we provide two state-of-the-art end-to-end architectures\\nfor open-loop trajectory prediction on nuScenes. (5) UniAD [21] incorporates a wide range of tasks,\\nsuch as mapping, tracking, motion, and occupancy prediction in a semi-sequential architecture, which\\nprocesses feature representations through several transformer decoders culminating in a trajectory\\nplanning module. (6) PARA-Drive [50] uses the same auxiliary tasks, but parallelizes the network\\narchitecture, such that the auxiliary task heads are trained in parallel with a shared encoder. Both\\nUniAD and PARA-Drive use a BEVFormer backbone [31], which encodes the eight surround-\\nview 1920 \\u00d7 1080 camera images over four temporal frames into a BEV feature representation.\\nImplementation details for all methods are provided in the supplementary material.\\nResults. We show our results on navtest in Table 1. The Constant Velocity model is a lower\\nbound, as the agent is used to identify trivial driving scenes excluded from the benchmark. The Ego\\nStatus MLP achieves a PDMS of 65.6, showing the value of the acceleration and navigation goal for\\navoiding collisions and driving off-road. However, we observe a clear gap between agents relying\\nsolely on the ego status and those considering sensor data, in contrast to results on nuScenes [32]. All\\nsensor agents achieve a PDMS of over 83, where TransFuser and PARA-Drive marginally perform\\nbest, with a PDMS of 84.0. Surprisingly, the camera-only LTF achieves similar results (83.8). UniAD\\nreaches a PDMS of 83.4, which, together with PARA-Drive, do not surpass the performance of\\nTransFuser and LTF, despite the need for more demanding training, e.g., 80 GPUs for 3 days to train\\nPARA-Drive versus 1 GPU for 1 day for TransFuser on the navtrain split. Due to the definition\\nof at-fault collisions, which discard certain rear-collisions into the ego vehicle, we suspect that\\nsurround-view cameras used by UniAD and PARA-Drive, and LiDAR input of TransFuser, are less\\nimportant than the wide-angle front camera which is the only input of LTF. The 10 PDMS discrepancy\\nto the human operator demonstrates that navtest poses challenges even to well-studied end-to-end\\narchitectures. Specifically, the drivable area compliance (DAC) and ego progress (EP) subscores\\nremain the most challenging. Notably, EP cannot be solved purely by human imitation, given that the\\nmaximum progress estimate used for normalization is based on a privileged rule-based motion planner.\\nInterestingly, all agents achieve near-perfect comfort scores, indicating that smooth acceleration and\\njerk profiles are learned naturally from human imitation.\\nAnalyzing TransFuser. In Table 2, we compare several training settings for TransFuser. For\\nthe three training seeds in configs A1-A3, we observe a standard deviation of \\u00b1 0.56 in PDMS,\\nwhich is relatively small compared to variance among training seeds for closed-loop simulations in\\nCARLA [17]. Further, unlike CARLA, NAVSIM is deterministic, and we obtain identical scores\\nwhen repeating evaluations of a deterministic driving agent. Discarding velocity and acceleration\\n(B1) lowers PDMS by 1.5 \\u22122.6, whereas only removing the acceleration (B2) lowers the score by\\n1.0 \\u22122.1. We conclude that while TransFuser benefits from the ego status, it is not purely relying\\non the kinematic state for planning. Next, only considering the front camera (C1) with a 60\\u25e6FOV\\nleads to a small drop in almost all subscores, compared to our default setting of three cropped and\\n8\\nconcatenated images with a FOV of 140\\u25e6. However, expanding the FOV with additional cameras\\ndoes not result in substantially improved scores. Interestingly, restricting the LiDAR range to 16m\\nin all directions (D1), results in a score of 79, which is lower than dropping LiDAR altogether (see\\nLTF in Table 1). Expanding the LiDAR range to 64m in the forward direction (D2) or all directions\\n(D3) does not provide significant improvements. We suspect that changes in the LiDAR range overly\\nsimplify or complicate the auxiliary 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation tasks, which\\noperate in the LiDAR coordinate frame, hindering effective imitation learning. We check the impact\\nof the auxiliary tasks by excluding them, where performance drops without BEV Segmentation (E1).\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nPDM Score\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n#Teams\\nConstant Velocity\\nTransFuser\\nFigure 5: NAVSIM Challenge.\\nCVPR 2024 NAVSIM Challenge. We organized the inaugu-\\nral NAVSIM challenge which ran from March - May 2024.\\nTo ensure integrity, we used a private dataset and only gave\\nparticipants access to sensor inputs, withholding all annota-\\ntions. Competitors could submit their agent\\u2019s trajectories to\\nour leaderboard, where they were simulated and scored to ob-\\ntain the PDMS. We received 463 submissions from 143 teams,\\nof which 78 submissions were made publicly visible. We sum-\\nmarize their scores in Fig. 5, relative to the constant velocity\\nand TransFuser baselines from Table 1. The winning entry\\nextended TransFuser and learned to predict proxy subscores\\nfor trajectory samples [30], with a sampling strategy inspired\\nby VADv2 [10]. These predicted subscores were weighted\\nalongside a human imitation score to select the output plan. While the idea of sampling and scoring\\ntrajectories is well-known [46, 51, 55, 6, 16], it has recently been overlooked in favor of approaches\\nwhich predict a single trajectory. This result prompts a reassessment of such methods. The team that\\nplaced second employed a vision language model (VLM) for driving, which is rapidly emerging as\\na sub-field in the AV literature [45, 33, 53, 58]. Several submissions attempted to reimplement or\\nextend prior work on nuScenes such as UniAD [21] and VAD [25], but were unable to outperform the\\nTransFuser baseline by the challenge submission deadline, given the significant engineering challenge\\nand compute requirements. The diversity of the solutions on the leaderboard shows the potential\\nof NAVSIM as a framework for pushing the frontiers of autonomous driving research.

Moreover, we analyze different (b) CLS durations d,\\n(c) planning frequencies f, (d) PDMS horizons h, and (e) closed-loop background agent behaviors.\\n4.1\\nAlignment Between Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Evaluation\\nOpen-loop metrics should ideally be aligned with closed-loop metrics in their evaluation of different\\ndriving algorithms. In this section, we benchmark a large set of planners to analyze the alignment of\\nclosed-loop metrics with traditional distance-based open-loop metrics and the proposed PDMS.\\nBenchmark. Studying the relation of closed-loop and open-loop metrics necessitates access to a\\nfully reactive simulator. To stay compatible with the dataset, we use the nuPlan simulator [26], which\\nenables simulation for privileged planners with access to ground-truth perception and HD map inputs.\\nSimilar to PDMS, nuPlan combines weighted averages and multiplied penalties in two official scores:\\nthe open-loop score (OLS) aggregates displacement and heading errors with a multiplied miss-rate,\\nand the closed-loop score (CLS) implements similar metrics from Section 3. Including PDMS, all\\nmetrics are in [0, 1] with higher scores indicating better performance.\\nDue to the heavy computational requirements of closed-loop simulation, we evaluate on the navmini\\nsplit. This is a new split we create for rapid testing, with 396 scenarios in total that are independent of\\nboth navtrain and navtest but filtered using the same strategy (Section 3.1) and hence similarly\\ndistributed. We note that nuPlan offers two kinds of background agents: reactive agents along lane\\ncenters based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [48], and non-reactive agents replayed from the\\ndataset, which we employ unless otherwise stated. While reactive simulations of longer or dynamic\\nlengths are generally desirable, e.g. to evaluate long-term decisions, enabling this requires dedicated\\nsolutions to long-horizon simulation that are not currently available in nuPlan [13]. Therefore, we\\ndefault to a fixed closed-loop simulation duration of d = 15s, and a planning frequency of f = 10Hz,\\nwhich are the standard closed-loop simulation settings in nuPlan [26].\\nMotion Planners. Open-loop metrics favor learned planners while rule-based approaches perform\\nwell in closed-loop evaluation in nuPlan [16]. We use a combination of both planner types in this\\nexperiment to cover different performance levels. In total, we include 37 rule-based planners with 2\\nconstant velocity and 8 constant acceleration models, 15 IDM planners [48], and 12 PDM-Closed\\nvariants [16] which differ in hyperparameters for trajectory generation. For learned planning, we\\nevaluate Urban Driver models [42] of 2 model sizes and 2 training lengths, and PlanCNN [38] models\\nwith 15 input combinations of the BEV raster, ego status, centerline, and navigation goal. We train\\nall models on {25%, 50%, 100%} of navtrain and an equally sized uniformly sampled subset of\\nOpenScene, giving 114 learned planners. See the supplementary material for additional details.\\nResults. The alignment between metrics is presented in Fig. 3 (a-e).

While\\nsensor agents improve, the gap to human performance highlights our benchmark\\u2019s challenges.\\nproperties of both learned and rule-based planners, whereas distance-based open-loop metrics show\\na clear misalignment. Decreasing the CLS duration in (b) from d = 15s to d = 4s further raises\\nthe correlation of PDMS and OLS, as the simulation horizon more closely matches the open-loop\\ncounterparts. Interestingly, we observe a higher correlation of open-loop metrics in (c) when reducing\\nthe planning frequency to 2Hz. We expect a lower planning frequency to mitigate cumulative errors\\nand enhance the controller\\u2019s stability in simulation, leading to more precise trajectory execution.\\nMoreover, we observe an increase in correlation for longer PDMS horizons in (d), ranging from\\nh = 2s to h = 8s. While predicting the future motion over 8s is challenging in uncertain scenarios,\\nour results indicate the value of long horizons when evaluating motion planners. Lastly, replacing the\\nnon-reactive background agents with reactive IDM vehicles during closed-loop simulation in (e) has\\nlittle effect on the correlation, possibly due to the similar difficulty of both tasks [16].\\nThe imbalanced distribution of different types of planners in our study may introduce biases into\\nthe overall correlations presented in Fig. 3. To address this, we visualize the individual correlations\\nof each planner type in Fig. 4. The correlation values vary depending on metric range and variance\\nof each planner type. Nevertheless, when examining each type individually, the PDMS is better\\ncorrelated to the CLS than the OLS, and is always positively correlated.\\n4.2\\nAnalysis of the State of the Art in End-to-End Autonomous Driving\\nIn this section, we benchmark a collection of end-to-end architectures, which previously achieved\\nstate-of-the-art performance on existing open- or closed-loop benchmarks.\\nMethods.

Both\\nUniAD and PARA-Drive use a BEVFormer backbone [31], which encodes the eight surround-\\nview 1920 \\u00d7 1080 camera images over four temporal frames into a BEV feature representation.\\nImplementation details for all methods are provided in the supplementary material.\\nResults. We show our results on navtest in Table 1. The Constant Velocity model is a lower\\nbound, as the agent is used to identify trivial driving scenes excluded from the benchmark. The Ego\\nStatus MLP achieves a PDMS of 65.6, showing the value of the acceleration and navigation goal for\\navoiding collisions and driving off-road. However, we observe a clear gap between agents relying\\nsolely on the ego status and those considering sensor data, in contrast to results on nuScenes [32]. All\\nsensor agents achieve a PDMS of over 83, where TransFuser and PARA-Drive marginally perform\\nbest, with a PDMS of 84.0. Surprisingly, the camera-only LTF achieves similar results (83.8). UniAD\\nreaches a PDMS of 83.4, which, together with PARA-Drive, do not surpass the performance of\\nTransFuser and LTF, despite the need for more demanding training, e.g., 80 GPUs for 3 days to train\\nPARA-Drive versus 1 GPU for 1 day for TransFuser on the navtrain split. Due to the definition\\nof at-fault collisions, which discard certain rear-collisions into the ego vehicle, we suspect that\\nsurround-view cameras used by UniAD and PARA-Drive, and LiDAR input of TransFuser, are less\\nimportant than the wide-angle front camera which is the only input of LTF. The 10 PDMS discrepancy\\nto the human operator demonstrates that navtest poses challenges even to well-studied end-to-end\\narchitectures. Specifically, the drivable area compliance (DAC) and ego progress (EP) subscores\\nremain the most challenging. Notably, EP cannot be solved purely by human imitation, given that the\\nmaximum progress estimate used for normalization is based on a privileged rule-based motion planner.\\nInterestingly, all agents achieve near-perfect comfort scores, indicating that smooth acceleration and\\njerk profiles are learned naturally from human imitation.\\nAnalyzing TransFuser. In Table 2, we compare several training settings for TransFuser. For\\nthe three training seeds in configs A1-A3, we observe a standard deviation of \\u00b1 0.56 in PDMS,\\nwhich is relatively small compared to variance among training seeds for closed-loop simulations in\\nCARLA [17]. Further, unlike CARLA, NAVSIM is deterministic, and we obtain identical scores\\nwhen repeating evaluations of a deterministic driving agent. Discarding velocity and acceleration\\n(B1) lowers PDMS by 1.5 \\u22122.6, whereas only removing the acceleration (B2) lowers the score by\\n1.0 \\u22122.1. We conclude that while TransFuser benefits from the ego status, it is not purely relying\\non the kinematic state for planning. Next, only considering the front camera (C1) with a 60\\u25e6FOV\\nleads to a small drop in almost all subscores, compared to our default setting of three cropped and\\n8\\nconcatenated images with a FOV of 140\\u25e6. However, expanding the FOV with additional cameras\\ndoes not result in substantially improved scores. Interestingly, restricting the LiDAR range to 16m\\nin all directions (D1), results in a score of 79, which is lower than dropping LiDAR altogether (see\\nLTF in Table 1). Expanding the LiDAR range to 64m in the forward direction (D2) or all directions\\n(D3) does not provide significant improvements. We suspect that changes in the LiDAR range overly\\nsimplify or complicate the auxiliary 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation tasks, which\\noperate in the LiDAR coordinate frame, hindering effective imitation learning. We check the impact\\nof the auxiliary tasks by excluding them, where performance drops without BEV Segmentation (E1).\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nPDM Score\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n#Teams\\nConstant Velocity\\nTransFuser\\nFigure 5: NAVSIM Challenge.\\nCVPR 2024 NAVSIM Challenge.

These predicted subscores were weighted\\nalongside a human imitation score to select the output plan. While the idea of sampling and scoring\\ntrajectories is well-known [46, 51, 55, 6, 16], it has recently been overlooked in favor of approaches\\nwhich predict a single trajectory.

In this section, we benchmark a large set of planners to analyze the alignment of\\nclosed-loop metrics with traditional distance-based open-loop metrics and the proposed PDMS.\\nBenchmark. Studying the relation of closed-loop and open-loop metrics necessitates access to a\\nfully reactive simulator. To stay compatible with the dataset, we use the nuPlan simulator [26], which\\nenables simulation for privileged planners with access to ground-truth perception and HD map inputs.\\nSimilar to PDMS, nuPlan combines weighted averages and multiplied penalties in two official scores:\\nthe open-loop score (OLS) aggregates displacement and heading errors with a multiplied miss-rate,\\nand the closed-loop score (CLS) implements similar metrics from Section 3. Including PDMS, all\\nmetrics are in [0, 1] with higher scores indicating better performance.\\nDue to the heavy computational requirements of closed-loop simulation, we evaluate on the navmini\\nsplit. This is a new split we create for rapid testing, with 396 scenarios in total that are independent of\\nboth navtrain and navtest but filtered using the same strategy (Section 3.1) and hence similarly\\ndistributed. We note that nuPlan offers two kinds of background agents: reactive agents along lane\\ncenters based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [48], and non-reactive agents replayed from the\\ndataset, which we employ unless otherwise stated. While reactive simulations of longer or dynamic\\nlengths are generally desirable, e.g. to evaluate long-term decisions, enabling this requires dedicated\\nsolutions to long-horizon simulation that are not currently available in nuPlan [13]. Therefore, we\\ndefault to a fixed closed-loop simulation duration of d = 15s, and a planning frequency of f = 10Hz,\\nwhich are the standard closed-loop simulation settings in nuPlan [26].\\nMotion Planners. Open-loop metrics favor learned planners while rule-based approaches perform\\nwell in closed-loop evaluation in nuPlan [16]. We use a combination of both planner types in this\\nexperiment to cover different performance levels. In total, we include 37 rule-based planners with 2\\nconstant velocity and 8 constant acceleration models, 15 IDM planners [48], and 12 PDM-Closed\\nvariants [16] which differ in hyperparameters for trajectory generation. For learned planning, we\\nevaluate Urban Driver models [42] of 2 model sizes and 2 training lengths, and PlanCNN [38] models\\nwith 15 input combinations of the BEV raster, ego status, centerline, and navigation goal. We train\\nall models on {25%, 50%, 100%} of navtrain and an equally sized uniformly sampled subset of\\nOpenScene, giving 114 learned planners.

While\\nsensor agents improve, the gap to human performance highlights our benchmark\\u2019s challenges.\\nproperties of both learned and rule-based planners, whereas distance-based open-loop metrics show\\na clear misalignment. Decreasing the CLS duration in (b) from d = 15s to d = 4s further raises\\nthe correlation of PDMS and OLS, as the simulation horizon more closely matches the open-loop\\ncounterparts.

While predicting the future motion over 8s is challenging in uncertain scenarios,\\nour results indicate the value of long horizons when evaluating motion planners. Lastly, replacing the\\nnon-reactive background agents with reactive IDM vehicles during closed-loop simulation in (e) has\\nlittle effect on the correlation, possibly due to the similar difficulty of both tasks [16].\\nThe imbalanced distribution of different types of planners in our study may introduce biases into\\nthe overall correlations presented in Fig. 3. To address this, we visualize the individual correlations\\nof each planner type in Fig. 4. The correlation values vary depending on metric range and variance\\nof each planner type. Nevertheless, when examining each type individually, the PDMS is better\\ncorrelated to the CLS than the OLS, and is always positively correlated.\\n4.2\\nAnalysis of the State of the Art in End-to-End Autonomous Driving\\nIn this section, we benchmark a collection of end-to-end architectures, which previously achieved\\nstate-of-the-art performance on existing open- or closed-loop benchmarks.\\nMethods.

The default configuration, which obtains the best results, uses the\\nnavigation goal, velocity, and acceleration as ego status inputs. Its camera FOV is around 140\\u25e6and\\nLiDAR range is 32m to the front (F), back (B), left (L), and right (R). It uses both auxiliary tasks.\\nthe same architecture as TransFuser but replaces the LiDAR input with a learned embedding, hence\\nrequiring only camera inputs. Moreover, we provide two state-of-the-art end-to-end architectures\\nfor open-loop trajectory prediction on nuScenes. (5) UniAD [21] incorporates a wide range of tasks,\\nsuch as mapping, tracking, motion, and occupancy prediction in a semi-sequential architecture, which\\nprocesses feature representations through several transformer decoders culminating in a trajectory\\nplanning module. (6) PARA-Drive [50] uses the same auxiliary tasks, but parallelizes the network\\narchitecture, such that the auxiliary task heads are trained in parallel with a shared encoder. Both\\nUniAD and PARA-Drive use a BEVFormer backbone [31], which encodes the eight surround-\\nview 1920 \\u00d7 1080 camera images over four temporal frames into a BEV feature representation.\\nImplementation details for all methods are provided in the supplementary material.\\nResults. We show our results on navtest in Table 1. The Constant Velocity model is a lower\\nbound, as the agent is used to identify trivial driving scenes excluded from the benchmark. The Ego\\nStatus MLP achieves a PDMS of 65.6, showing the value of the acceleration and navigation goal for\\navoiding collisions and driving off-road. However, we observe a clear gap between agents relying\\nsolely on the ego status and those considering sensor data, in contrast to results on nuScenes [32]. All\\nsensor agents achieve a PDMS of over 83, where TransFuser and PARA-Drive marginally perform\\nbest, with a PDMS of 84.0. Surprisingly, the camera-only LTF achieves similar results (83.8). UniAD\\nreaches a PDMS of 83.4, which, together with PARA-Drive, do not surpass the performance of\\nTransFuser and LTF, despite the need for more demanding training, e.g., 80 GPUs for 3 days to train\\nPARA-Drive versus 1 GPU for 1 day for TransFuser on the navtrain split. Due to the definition\\nof at-fault collisions, which discard certain rear-collisions into the ego vehicle, we suspect that\\nsurround-view cameras used by UniAD and PARA-Drive, and LiDAR input of TransFuser, are less\\nimportant than the wide-angle front camera which is the only input of LTF. The 10 PDMS discrepancy\\nto the human operator demonstrates that navtest poses challenges even to well-studied end-to-end\\narchitectures. Specifically, the drivable area compliance (DAC) and ego progress (EP) subscores\\nremain the most challenging. Notably, EP cannot be solved purely by human imitation, given that the\\nmaximum progress estimate used for normalization is based on a privileged rule-based motion planner.\\nInterestingly, all agents achieve near-perfect comfort scores, indicating that smooth acceleration and\\njerk profiles are learned naturally from human imitation.\\nAnalyzing TransFuser. In Table 2, we compare several training settings for TransFuser. For\\nthe three training seeds in configs A1-A3, we observe a standard deviation of \\u00b1 0.56 in PDMS,\\nwhich is relatively small compared to variance among training seeds for closed-loop simulations in\\nCARLA [17]. Further, unlike CARLA, NAVSIM is deterministic, and we obtain identical scores\\nwhen repeating evaluations of a deterministic driving agent. Discarding velocity and acceleration\\n(B1) lowers PDMS by 1.5 \\u22122.6, whereas only removing the acceleration (B2) lowers the score by\\n1.0 \\u22122.1. We conclude that while TransFuser benefits from the ego status, it is not purely relying\\non the kinematic state for planning. Next, only considering the front camera (C1) with a 60\\u25e6FOV\\nleads to a small drop in almost all subscores, compared to our default setting of three cropped and\\n8\\nconcatenated images with a FOV of 140\\u25e6. However, expanding the FOV with additional cameras\\ndoes not result in substantially improved scores. Interestingly, restricting the LiDAR range to 16m\\nin all directions (D1), results in a score of 79, which is lower than dropping LiDAR altogether (see\\nLTF in Table 1). Expanding the LiDAR range to 64m in the forward direction (D2) or all directions\\n(D3) does not provide significant improvements.

We received 463 submissions from 143 teams,\\nof which 78 submissions were made publicly visible. We sum-\\nmarize their scores in Fig. 5, relative to the constant velocity\\nand TransFuser baselines from Table 1. The winning entry\\nextended TransFuser and learned to predict proxy subscores\\nfor trajectory samples [30], with a sampling strategy inspired\\nby VADv2 [10]. These predicted subscores were weighted\\nalongside a human imitation score to select the output plan. While the idea of sampling and scoring\\ntrajectories is well-known [46, 51, 55, 6, 16], it has recently been overlooked in favor of approaches\\nwhich predict a single trajectory. This result prompts a reassessment of such methods.

For multi-task settings, we use a different split of the training and development sets in each run.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We frst evaluate the performance of the scoring model by measuring how well it distinguishes the correct and incorrect argument role predictions from an event extraction model. Specifcally, we compute event predictions by running a fully trained event extraction model (i.e., OneIE or AMR-IE) on the validation and test sets of the three benchmark datasets. Based on the gold event annotations, we create a gold binary label (correct or incorrect) for each argument role prediction to indicate its correctness. For each event prediction, we pass it along with the corresponding AMR graph of the source sentence into the scoring model. If the correctness16 predicted by the scoring model agrees with the gold binary label, we treat it as a true prediction for scoring model, otherwise, a false prediction.\\nTo examine the impact of leveraging AMR in scoring model performance, we develop a baseline scoring model that shares the same structure with our proposed scoring model except that it does not take an AMR graph as an input. Specifcally, the baseline scoring model just takes the event mention (triggers, arguments and argument labels) in order to measure the compatibility score. The baseline scoring model is essentially an ablation of our scoring model where the AMR path is absent. As shown in Table 2, the performance of our scoring model outperforms the baseline scoring model by 1.4-1.7 F-score on the test sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graph in characterizing the correctness of each event prediction.\\nIn Table 1, we can observe that the semantics and structure of AMR paths can be easily mapped to argument role types. Sometimes, the even triggers are far from their arguments in plain text, but the AMR paths between them is short and informative. Another observation is that the scoring model tends to assign positive scores to argument roles that are more compatible with the AMR paths, although sometimes the scores for the gold argument roles are not the highest.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 3 shows the event extraction results of both our approach and strong baselines17. For clarity, in the rest of the section, we refer to our proposed framework as STFAMR and our proposed framework with the baseline scoring model as STFW\\/O_AMR. We can see that, both STFAMR and STFW\\/O_AMR improve the performance of the event extraction models on argument role classifcation while the vanilla self-training and GradLRE barely work, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging the feedback to the pseudo labels during selftraining.\\nWe further analyze the reasons in terms of why the vanilla self-training and GradLRE do not work and notice that: due to the data scarcity, the base event extraction model (i.e., OneIE) performs poorly on many argument roles (lower than $40\\\\%$ F-score). Thus, the event predictions on unlabeled corpora can be very noisy and inaccurate. The model suffers from confrmation bias (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017; Arazo et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020): it accumulates errors and diverges when it\\u2019s iteratively trained on such noisy pseudo labeled examples during self-training. In addition, we also notice that with self-training, the event extraction model becomes overconfdent about its predictions. We check the averaged probability of all the argument role predictions on the unlabeled dataset which is 0.93. In such case, it is clear that the predicted probability can not faithfully refect the correctness of the predictions, which is referred as the calibration error (Guo et al., 2017; NiculescuMizil and Caruana, 2005). Thus, the self-training process which relies on overconfdent prediction can become highly biased and diverge from the initial baseline model. In GradLRE, the quality of the reward is highly depend on the averaged gradient direction computed during the supervised training process. However, due to the scarcity of the training data, the stored gradient direction can be unreliable. In addition, the gradient computed on the pseudo-labeled dataset with high reward is used to update the average gradient direction, which can introduce noises into the reward function. As seen in Table 3, the best models of self-training and GradLRE are on par or worse than the baseline approach, and these approaches show the detrimental effects as they show a continuous decline of the performance as training proceeds.\\n\\nBy considering AMR structure, STFAMR encourages the event extraction models to predict event structures that are more compatible with AMR graphs. This claim is supported by Table 4, which compares the compatibility scores between the model without STF (OneIE baseline) and one with STF (OneIE $+{\\\\bf S}\\\\mathrm{TF}$ ) framework on the three benchmark datasets. The compatibility scores are measured by the AMR based scoring models. We can clearly see that the compatibility scores measured on OneIE+STFAMR are much higher than the scores measured on base OneIE.\\nLastly, we observe that OneIE+STFAMR outperforms AMR-IE $^{,+}$ STFAMR, even when AMR-IE performs better than OneIE baseline without STF. We argue the reason is that even though STFAMR does not need AMR parsing at inference time, AMRIE does require AMR graphs at inference time which causes it to suffer from potential errors in the AMR parsing. On the other hand, OneIE trained by STFAMR does not require AMR graphs at inference time, making it free from potential error propagation. Figure 2 shows more examples to illustrate how the feedback from AMR structures in STF helps to improve event predictions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To gain a deeper understanding of cTBLS, we conducted human evaluation using the metrics outlined by Nakamura et al. (2022), namely Coherence, Fluency, and Informativeness. For the evaluation of these metrics, we enlisted crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess $50\\\\%$ of the test data. The evaluation process involved a comparison between the responses generated by HYBRIDIALOGUE and cTBLS Top-3.\\nIn accordance with the methodology delineated in Nakamura et al. (2022), Coherence was defned as the degree to which a response continued the conversation in a logically coherent manner based on prior context. Fluency, conversely, was determined by evaluating absence of grammatical and spelling errors, and appropriate use of parts of speech.\\nTo ensure the quality of the evaluated responses, we engaged crowd workers possessing a Masters qualifcation on AMT and originating from Englishspeaking countries (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Great Britain). Each task required approximately 30 seconds to complete, and workers were remunerated at a rate of $\\\\mathbb{S}0.05$ per task. Moreover, to minimize bias and guarantee the dependability of the evaluations, we assigned two crowd workers to assess each response, with a response deemed more coherent or fuent only if both evaluations concurred.\\nThe results presented in Table 5 reveal that the responses generated by cTBLS Top-3 were more coherent than those produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE in $84.2\\\\%$ of cases and exhibited greater fuency $82.7\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that improvements in table retrieval, knowledge retrieval, and response generation lead to better downstream performance.\\nInformativeness represents the accuracy of machine-generated responses when compared to the ground-truth (Nakamura et al., 2022) and serves as a measure of hallucination in LLMs. Hallucinated responses tend to be less informative, deviating signifcantly from the ground-truth.\\nTo evaluate informativeness, crowd workers determined whether generated responses were semantically equivalent to the ground truth response. Each response was assessed by two Turkers, and a response was deemed more informative only if there was inter-annotator agreement. The absence of illustrative examples in the prompting process resulted in responses generated by cTBLS Top-1 and cTBLS Top-3 being longer than the ground truth response. Consequently, the knowledge-augmented cTBLS responses were considered informative if all the information provided in the ground truth was encapsulated in the model response, even if cTBLS included supplementary information.\\n\\nThe data in Table 6 indicate that cTBLS Top-3 encompasses the same information as the ground truth response $50\\\\%$ of the time, a higher rate than cTBLS Top-1 at $45.6\\\\%$ , exemplifying the benefts of partitioning retrieval into coarse and fne state tracking and augmenting with additional knowledge. Based on these fndings, we hypothesize that the attention mechanism in decoder models facilitates additional knowledge retrieval. cTBLS NoK generates the correct response $30.6\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that HYBRIDIALOGUE comprises questions and answers predicated on general world knowledge embedded in the weights of LLMs. Responses produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE are informative in merely $12.4\\\\%$ of instances.\\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of responses generated by various confgurations of cTBLS on the HYBRIDIALOGUE dataset. The entire dialogue history constitutes the context and is depicted as an exchange between the user (in blue) and the system (in yellow). The fnal question box represents the follow-up query to be addressed, while the last answer chat box indicates the ground truth response. Knowledge K1, K2, and K3 correspond to cells of the table retrieved during state tracking, based on which responses are produced. cTBLS NoK generates a response solely relying on the context, cTBLS Top-1 formulates a response conditioned on K1, and cTBLS Top-3 devises a response based on K1, K2, and K3.\\ncTBLS NoK creates a hallucinated response, answering with the random Faroese club B68 Toftir. Similarly, cTBLS Top-1 hallucinates a response, opting for B36 T\\u00f3rshavn, as K1 refers to the stadium Vi\\u00f2 Marg\\u00e1ir rather than the correct club\\u2019s name. In contrast, cTBLS Top-3 produces the accurate response, EB\\/Streymur, since K3 contains the necessary information. This example demonstrates the benefts of augmenting response generation with additional pertinent knowledge, which aids in mitigating the hallucination problem (Maynez et al., 2020).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Evaluation details\\nE.1\\nSynthetic tasks\\nWe implement our neural process by modifying the Llama 2 architecture [42] to model sequences of\\ncontinuous variables.

We use F1 scores as the main evaluation metrics (Zhang et al., 2021a; Mao et al., 2022). All reported F1 scores are averaged over 5 runs with different random seeds. For multi-task settings, we use a different split of the training and development sets in each run.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We frst evaluate the performance of the scoring model by measuring how well it distinguishes the correct and incorrect argument role predictions from an event extraction model. Specifcally, we compute event predictions by running a fully trained event extraction model (i.e., OneIE or AMR-IE) on the validation and test sets of the three benchmark datasets. Based on the gold event annotations, we create a gold binary label (correct or incorrect) for each argument role prediction to indicate its correctness. For each event prediction, we pass it along with the corresponding AMR graph of the source sentence into the scoring model. If the correctness16 predicted by the scoring model agrees with the gold binary label, we treat it as a true prediction for scoring model, otherwise, a false prediction.\\nTo examine the impact of leveraging AMR in scoring model performance, we develop a baseline scoring model that shares the same structure with our proposed scoring model except that it does not take an AMR graph as an input. Specifcally, the baseline scoring model just takes the event mention (triggers, arguments and argument labels) in order to measure the compatibility score. The baseline scoring model is essentially an ablation of our scoring model where the AMR path is absent. As shown in Table 2, the performance of our scoring model outperforms the baseline scoring model by 1.4-1.7 F-score on the test sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graph in characterizing the correctness of each event prediction.\\nIn Table 1, we can observe that the semantics and structure of AMR paths can be easily mapped to argument role types. Sometimes, the even triggers are far from their arguments in plain text, but the AMR paths between them is short and informative. Another observation is that the scoring model tends to assign positive scores to argument roles that are more compatible with the AMR paths, although sometimes the scores for the gold argument roles are not the highest.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 3 shows the event extraction results of both our approach and strong baselines17. For clarity, in the rest of the section, we refer to our proposed framework as STFAMR and our proposed framework with the baseline scoring model as STFW\\/O_AMR. We can see that, both STFAMR and STFW\\/O_AMR improve the performance of the event extraction models on argument role classifcation while the vanilla self-training and GradLRE barely work, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging the feedback to the pseudo labels during selftraining.\\nWe further analyze the reasons in terms of why the vanilla self-training and GradLRE do not work and notice that: due to the data scarcity, the base event extraction model (i.e., OneIE) performs poorly on many argument roles (lower than $40\\\\%$ F-score). Thus, the event predictions on unlabeled corpora can be very noisy and inaccurate. The model suffers from confrmation bias (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017; Arazo et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020): it accumulates errors and diverges when it\\u2019s iteratively trained on such noisy pseudo labeled examples during self-training. In addition, we also notice that with self-training, the event extraction model becomes overconfdent about its predictions. We check the averaged probability of all the argument role predictions on the unlabeled dataset which is 0.93. In such case, it is clear that the predicted probability can not faithfully refect the correctness of the predictions, which is referred as the calibration error (Guo et al., 2017; NiculescuMizil and Caruana, 2005). Thus, the self-training process which relies on overconfdent prediction can become highly biased and diverge from the initial baseline model. In GradLRE, the quality of the reward is highly depend on the averaged gradient direction computed during the supervised training process. However, due to the scarcity of the training data, the stored gradient direction can be unreliable. In addition, the gradient computed on the pseudo-labeled dataset with high reward is used to update the average gradient direction, which can introduce noises into the reward function. As seen in Table 3, the best models of self-training and GradLRE are on par or worse than the baseline approach, and these approaches show the detrimental effects as they show a continuous decline of the performance as training proceeds.\\n\\nBy considering AMR structure, STFAMR encourages the event extraction models to predict event structures that are more compatible with AMR graphs. This claim is supported by Table 4, which compares the compatibility scores between the model without STF (OneIE baseline) and one with STF (OneIE $+{\\\\bf S}\\\\mathrm{TF}$ ) framework on the three benchmark datasets. The compatibility scores are measured by the AMR based scoring models. We can clearly see that the compatibility scores measured on OneIE+STFAMR are much higher than the scores measured on base OneIE.\\nLastly, we observe that OneIE+STFAMR outperforms AMR-IE $^{,+}$ STFAMR, even when AMR-IE performs better than OneIE baseline without STF. We argue the reason is that even though STFAMR does not need AMR parsing at inference time, AMRIE does require AMR graphs at inference time which causes it to suffer from potential errors in the AMR parsing. On the other hand, OneIE trained by STFAMR does not require AMR graphs at inference time, making it free from potential error propagation. Figure 2 shows more examples to illustrate how the feedback from AMR structures in STF helps to improve event predictions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To gain a deeper understanding of cTBLS, we conducted human evaluation using the metrics outlined by Nakamura et al. (2022), namely Coherence, Fluency, and Informativeness. For the evaluation of these metrics, we enlisted crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess $50\\\\%$ of the test data. The evaluation process involved a comparison between the responses generated by HYBRIDIALOGUE and cTBLS Top-3.\\nIn accordance with the methodology delineated in Nakamura et al. (2022), Coherence was defned as the degree to which a response continued the conversation in a logically coherent manner based on prior context. Fluency, conversely, was determined by evaluating absence of grammatical and spelling errors, and appropriate use of parts of speech.\\nTo ensure the quality of the evaluated responses, we engaged crowd workers possessing a Masters qualifcation on AMT and originating from Englishspeaking countries (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Great Britain). Each task required approximately 30 seconds to complete, and workers were remunerated at a rate of $\\\\mathbb{S}0.05$ per task. Moreover, to minimize bias and guarantee the dependability of the evaluations, we assigned two crowd workers to assess each response, with a response deemed more coherent or fuent only if both evaluations concurred.\\nThe results presented in Table 5 reveal that the responses generated by cTBLS Top-3 were more coherent than those produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE in $84.2\\\\%$ of cases and exhibited greater fuency $82.7\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that improvements in table retrieval, knowledge retrieval, and response generation lead to better downstream performance.\\nInformativeness represents the accuracy of machine-generated responses when compared to the ground-truth (Nakamura et al., 2022) and serves as a measure of hallucination in LLMs. Hallucinated responses tend to be less informative, deviating signifcantly from the ground-truth.\\nTo evaluate informativeness, crowd workers determined whether generated responses were semantically equivalent to the ground truth response. Each response was assessed by two Turkers, and a response was deemed more informative only if there was inter-annotator agreement. The absence of illustrative examples in the prompting process resulted in responses generated by cTBLS Top-1 and cTBLS Top-3 being longer than the ground truth response. Consequently, the knowledge-augmented cTBLS responses were considered informative if all the information provided in the ground truth was encapsulated in the model response, even if cTBLS included supplementary information.\\n\\nThe data in Table 6 indicate that cTBLS Top-3 encompasses the same information as the ground truth response $50\\\\%$ of the time, a higher rate than cTBLS Top-1 at $45.6\\\\%$ , exemplifying the benefts of partitioning retrieval into coarse and fne state tracking and augmenting with additional knowledge. Based on these fndings, we hypothesize that the attention mechanism in decoder models facilitates additional knowledge retrieval. cTBLS NoK generates the correct response $30.6\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that HYBRIDIALOGUE comprises questions and answers predicated on general world knowledge embedded in the weights of LLMs. Responses produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE are informative in merely $12.4\\\\%$ of instances.\\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of responses generated by various confgurations of cTBLS on the HYBRIDIALOGUE dataset. The entire dialogue history constitutes the context and is depicted as an exchange between the user (in blue) and the system (in yellow). The fnal question box represents the follow-up query to be addressed, while the last answer chat box indicates the ground truth response. Knowledge K1, K2, and K3 correspond to cells of the table retrieved during state tracking, based on which responses are produced. cTBLS NoK generates a response solely relying on the context, cTBLS Top-1 formulates a response conditioned on K1, and cTBLS Top-3 devises a response based on K1, K2, and K3.\\ncTBLS NoK creates a hallucinated response, answering with the random Faroese club B68 Toftir. Similarly, cTBLS Top-1 hallucinates a response, opting for B36 T\\u00f3rshavn, as K1 refers to the stadium Vi\\u00f2 Marg\\u00e1ir rather than the correct club\\u2019s name. In contrast, cTBLS Top-3 produces the accurate response, EB\\/Streymur, since K3 contains the necessary information. This example demonstrates the benefts of augmenting response generation with additional pertinent knowledge, which aids in mitigating the hallucination problem (Maynez et al., 2020).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Evaluation details\\nE.1\\nSynthetic tasks\\nWe implement our neural process by modifying the Llama 2 architecture [42] to model sequences of\\ncontinuous variables.

We replace\\nthe label Sci\\/Tech with Science for AG News and not entailment with not for RTE and WNLI. We\\nfilter out any queries of length longer than 116 tokens. Full descriptions of these datasets are given in\\nAppendix F.2.\\nTo implement ICL for a given dataset, we sample a response balanced training set of query\\/response\\npairs Dtrain = (xi, yi)n\\n1.

An example prompt from the Subjectivity dataset is shown in\\nAppendix E.2.\\nFor our experiments in 3.2, we employ LLaMA-2 [42], a family of open source LLMs based on an\\nauto-regressive transformer, pretrained on 2 trillion tokens with a context window of 4,096 tokens.\\nWe run LLaMA-2-7B as an unquantized model (16-bit).\\nTo estimate the predictive distribution over responses, we sample n input\\/label pairs based on the\\ngiven context length, create a prompt based on the context, and generate y samples. An example of a\\nprompt from the Subjectivity dataset is set forth in Figure 7.\\nThe y samples are generated as single tokens, since all labels for our datasets can be identified based\\non their first token. We set the temperature and top_p parameters to 1 to provide the greatest\\npossible diversity and randomness to the label output.\\nFor predictive resampling, we initialize the context by sampling n input\\/label pairs, generate N \\u2212n\\nnew context examples by producing prompts that include the updated context, and produce y samples\\nfrom the cumulative context.
