{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Previous approaches have explored various prompting schemes, yet they suffer from error propagation due to the autoregressive nature and single-pass-based decoding, which lack error correction capability. Additionally, relying solely on a single sample may result in the omission of true nodes and edges. To counter this, we draw inspiration from self-consistency (SC), which involves sampling a diverse set of reasoning chains and taking the majority vote as the fnal answer. To tackle the substantial challenge of applying SC on generated graphs, we propose MIDGARD (MInimum Description length Guided Aggregation of Reasoning in Directed acyclic graph) that leverages Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based formulation to identify consistent properties among the different graph samples generated by an LLM. This formulation helps reject properties that appear in only a few samples, which are likely to be erroneous, while enabling the inclusion of missing elements without compromising precision. Our method demonstrates superior performance than comparisons across various structured reasoning tasks, including argument structure extraction, explanation graph generation, inferring dependency relations among actions for everyday tasks, and semantic graph generation from natural texts.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"While large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive performance in fewshot\\/zero-shot scenarios across diverse reasoning tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Rae et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022), it is still challenging to apply these models for structured commonsense reasoning which involves generating task-specifc reasoning as a graph, such as extracting argument structures from argumentative text (Stab and Gurevych, 2017; Hua et al., 2019; Mayer et al., 2020; Hua and Wang, 2022; Qiao et al., 2022), generating structured explanations that lay out commonsense knowledge to connect an argument to a belief (Saha et al., 2021), and inferring dependencies among events for everyday activities (Sakaguchi et al., 2021).\\n\\nThere are two main challenges for structured reasoning tasks. (1) Style discrepancy: Conventional approaches for structured response generation represent the graphs as fattened strings (Madaan and Yang, 2021; Madaan et al., 2021; Sakaguchi et al., 2021; Saha et al., 2021), leading to subpar performance due to output style mismatch (Madaan et al., 2022). (2) Error propagation: Any incorrect decisions made earlier in the autoregressive decoding process can infuence later generation steps (Yao et al., 2023). Recently, Madaan et al. (2022) propose COCOGEN to address the issue of style mismatch in structured reasoning tasks, by using programming scripts as prompts for LLMs. It still suffers from error propagation, since it generates variable declarations and function calls in order to describe the nodes and edges within the graph. Any error in these declarations\\/calls can affect the subsequent generations.\\nTo address these issues, we take inspiration from the self-consistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2023b) strategy that samples diverse reasoning paths and then takes a majority vote as the fnal answer. The intuition behind SC is that sampling distinct reasoning chains leads to higher confdence in the correctness of a consistent answer. Therefore, we hypothesize that sampling diverse graphs from an LLM can construct a more accurate aggregate graph and alleviate error propagation for structured reasoning tasks as any errors made in one sample are less likely to persist across all the generated graphs.\\nA crucial distinction between SC and our desideratum is that SC focuses exclusively on commonsense reasoning tasks (Ling et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2018; Cobbe et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021; Geva et al., 2021) with scalar answer spaces. In contrast, we aim to merge multiple graphs, each representing a collection of unordered sets (nodes and edges). It is unclear how to apply majority vote to aggregate distinct sets of nodes and edges. In particular, it would be critical to flter out inaccurate nodes and edges in our setup.\\n\\nTo achieve this, we propose MIDGARD1, based on MInimum Description length Guided Aggregation of Reasoning in Directed acyclic graph. We employ the principle of minimum description length (MDL) (Rissanen, 1978) which seeks to fnd the hypothesis with shortest description length of the observations. While MDL has been implemented for model selection (Gr\\u00fcnwald, 2005), causal structure learning (Lam and Bacchus, 1993, 1994), data clustering (Rissanen, 2000), and dimensionality reduction (Bruni et al., 2022), to the best of our knowledge, its use in automatically merging graph samples has never been explored before. Assuming that graph properties consistent across multiple generated samples are more likely to be accurate, we defne the description length of a graph sample as the weighted sum of the transformations required to convert a hypothesis into the given sample. By constructing a hypothesis that minimizes the description length across all the generated samples, our solution encourages the inclusion of graph properties that were present in many samples, while rejecting properties that were only present in a few samples which are likely to be erroneous. Figure 1 shows an example of how our approach reduces errors compared to relying solely on a single greedy generation. Empirical results on four different structured reasoning tasks, including argument structure extraction, structured explanation construction, and goal-oriented script generation and semantic graph generation, on eight benchmarks show that MIDGARD can outperform competitive baseline and model variants, demonstrating its strong generalizability.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In structured reasoning, a labeled data point is denoted as $(\\\\tau,\\\\mathcal{G})$ , where $\\\\tau$ represents the input and $\\\\mathcal{G}$ is the task-specifc graph output that captures the necessary reasoning knowledge.

In graph aggregation, MDL can be used as a selfconsistency strategy to merge multiple reasoning graph samples into a single aggregate graph. The core idea is to defne a description length for each graph sample, which is proportional to the number of transformations required to convert a hypothesis into the given sample. By minimizing the description length for samples $\\\\{\\\\mathcal{G}_{i}^{\\\\prime}\\\\}_{i=1}^{T}$ , MDL encourages the inclusion of graph properties that are common across different samples. This means that properties that appear frequently in the generated samples are more likely to be accurate and refect the underlying structure. Conversely, properties that are only present in a few samples tend to be wrong.\\nIn many structured reasoning tasks, the graphs typically do not have singleton nodes. For example, in argumentative structures of essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2017), nodes are either supported or attacked by other nodes, or they themselves support or attack other nodes. We begin by defning the description length of a graph $\\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\prime}$ based on the hypothesis $\\\\mathcal{G}$ when the graphs do not contain singleton nodes in $\\\\S3.1$ . Next, we derive the expression for the expected description length in $\\\\S3.2$ assuming that $\\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\prime}$ is sampled from an LLM.

We introduce the hyperparameter $\\\\lambda$ , which can be interpreted as the number of bits needed to describe a single addition, when $(1-\\\\lambda)$ bits are needed to describe a single deletion. The subscript $\\\\mathbf{E}$ in Eq. 1 indicates that only edge transformations are considered when calculating the description length. Since these graphs do not have isolated nodes and each node is associated with at least one edge, the description length of $\\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\prime}$ can be precisely captured using edge transformations alone.\\nThe defnition in Eq. 1 is inspired by the formulation proposed by Lam and Bacchus (1994) , who applied it for refning causal graphs based on new data but not for the task of graph aggregation.
