{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Lexical-level metrics, e.g., ROUGE (Lin, 2004), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), count the n-gram overlap between the candidate response and the reference response. These methods usually correlate poorly with human evaluation results due to the lexical mismatch problem (Liu et al., 2016). Semantic-level metrics evaluate address lexical mismatch problem by calculating similarity with high-dimension embeddings. For example, Sharma et al. (2017) measures the embedding distance between golden and generated response. Ghazarian et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2019a) enhance the text representation using the large pretrain model, which has shown exemplary performance in capturing semantic similarity. However, they suffer from the one-to-many problem when evaluating open-domain dialogues since responses with various semantics may fit the dialogue context.\\nRecent works tend to relieve this drawback by annotating multiple references for dialogue, commonly referred to as multi-reference methods (Li et al., 2017; Sai et al., 2020), which are costly and hard to generalize to agnostic scenarios. The proposed RADE aims to consider the pre-created response as a candidate instead of the golden standard to address the one-to-many problem of dialogue evaluation.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 Reference-free dialogue evaluation\",\"section_content\":\"The reference-free methods are gaining more attention as they correlate more with human judgment only with the dialogue context and response. For example, MAUDE predicts the score of dialogue using pre-trained language models, GRADE (Huang et al., 2020) evaluates the coherence of dialogues with the augmentation of the commonsense graph, EMS (Chan et al., 2021) enhances the dialogue evaluation by capturing the representation of the context and response in latent space. Some methods further decompose the evaluation of responses into multiple perspectives (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020a,c; Phy et al., 2020), such as relevance, fluency, and engagingness, then aggregate the overall score from different sub-metrics with a weighted average. However, some recent studies (Khalid and Lee, 2022; Deutsch et al., 2022) reveal that the referencefree methods are vulnerable to data-induced biases and inherently biased toward models which are more similar to their own. In contrast, this paper proposes a reference-assisted approach, which enhances the robustness of the model using reference responses as a benchmark.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Task Formulation\",\"section_content\":\"In this work, we propose two tasks: (1) extending the existing datasets by human annotation, and (2) leveraging the rated references collected in (1) to enhance automatic evaluation.\\nHuman annotation Human annotation aims to extend existing datasets with multiple rated responses to facilitate automatic evaluation. Given a dialogue context $c$ , which is always paired with a golden response (denoted as reference) $r_{h}$ , we employ the generation models, e.g., BlenderBot (Roller et al., 2021), to generate one more response $r_{a}$ . We then assign a fixed overall score or derive from existing datasets to the reference as $s_{h}$ . The annotators are instructed to rate $r_{a}$ as $s_{a}$ , following the same scale while taking the reference as a benchmark. The annotators are also asked to revise the reference score $s_{h}$ if $s_{h}$ is inappropriate.\\nAutomatic evaluation Given a dialogue context $c$ , the proposed RADE learns to evaluate the response $r_{a}$ with the assistance of reference $r_{h}$ under the multi-task learning framework.

Since there are multiple perspectives to assess the response, we simplify by sorting the possible aspects into two categories: the general view and the task-specific view.

And task-specific criteria consist of understandability, emotional awareness, and personality awareness, which correspond to chitchat dialogue, emotional dialogue, and persona dialogue. We annotate rates on each metric and calculate the overall rating score by weighting these sub-metrics. Specifically, the weights are obtained based on the preference of users (see section A.1.3 for more details).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.1 Data preparation\",\"section_content\":\"We consider three datasets to extend: \\u2022 DSTC\\u2013 ChitChat (ChitChat) (Hori and Hori, 2017), a chitchat dataset collected from Twitter, each example derived from the conversation between a customer and an agent. \\u2022 Empathetic Dialogues (EmpaDial) (Rashkin et al., 2019), which consists of $25\\\\mathrm{k}$ dialogues grounded in emotional situations.\\n\\u2022 PersonaChat (Zhang et al., 2018), a real-world dataset consisting of 10k dialogues where each participant plays the part of an assigned persona.\\nThen, we collect model-generated responses using the following seven well-performing dialogue models on these datasets: BlenderBot (Roller et al., 2021), DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 2019b), KEMP (Li et al., 2020b), MoEL (Lin et al., 2019), MIME (Majumder et al., 2020), EmpDG (Li et al., 2020a), PersonaGPT (Tang et al., 2021). The train-dev-test of collected datasets are split as Chitchat (1490\\/300\\/300, 5\\/1\\/1), Empathetic Dialogue (3022\\/500\\/500, 6\\/1\\/1), and Persona Chat (3000\\/500\\/500, 6\\/1\\/1).

The dialogue context, rated reference response, and corresponding score are provided in each example. At least three annotators are required for each example. We annotated about 10k dialogues for the three datasets, and the statistics of the collected datasets are listed in Table 2. The ratings achieve reasonable inter-annotator agreements with Fleiss Kappa scores of 0.540, 0.554, and 0.533 on three datasets, respectively.
