{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

First, to satisfy the complementary principle, EMHA removes the oneto-one mapping constraint among queries and keys in multiple subspaces and allows each query to attend to multiple keys. On top of that, we develop a method to fully encourage consensus among heads by introducing two interaction models, namely inner-subspace interaction and cross-subspace interaction.

A key factor contributing to their success is the multi-head self-attention network (MHSA), which enables effcient modeling of global dependencies among tokens in parallel. Notably, instead of utilizing a single attention mechanism, MHSA uses an ensemble of attention models, each models a small subspace, and fnally aggregates these results to the fnal one. The core idea is similar to subspace learning (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) or multi-view learning (Chaudhuri et al., 2009).\\nIn the realm of multi-view learning, two fundamental principles guide the research: the complementary principle and the consensus principle (Xu et al., 2013). The complementary principle emphasizes that each data view may possess unique knowledge not present in other views, prompting the use of multiple views for a comprehensive and accurate data description. On the contrary, the consensus principle aims to maximize the agreement on multiple distinct views. However, in the context of MHSA design, most studies predominantly focus on the complementary principle. This oversight is evident in their encouragement of diverse information capture by different heads (Li et al., 2018; Cui et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2024) and the adoption of complex aggregation operations (Li et al., 2019; Wang and Tu, 2020). Some studies (Michel et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019; Behnke and Heafeld, 2020) even consider the high similarity among attention heads as a signifcant problem referred to as attention redundancy.\\nAlthough diversity is crucial in multi-view learning, Dasgupta et al. (2001) has shown that simply fusing diverse outputs does not guarantee improved results: the probability of a disagreement of two independent hypotheses upper bounds the error rate of either hypothesis. The consensus principle highlights the need to minimize disagreement among views to achieve better outcomes. In response to the consensus principle, several studies (Kumar and III, 2011; Kumar et al., 2011) have focused on minimizing disagreement among views to achieve better outcomes. However, in the context of MHSA research, there is a tendency to prioritize complementarity over consensus among different attention heads. Here we ask a question: Can balancing these two principles beneft the design of MHSA mechanisms?\\nHowever, encouraging such a consensus in multihead self-attention is challenging. In our preliminary experiments, we found that directly utilizing regularization terms can achieve this goal but cannot improve performance. Drawing inspirations from human behavior where group discussions and interactions foster consensus, we propose introducing interactions among different subspaces in MHSA to achieve consensus.\\n\\nTo this end, we propose a new multi-head self-attention variant: Enhanced Multi-Head SelfAttention, which encourages consensus among attention heads while guaranteeing to contain suffcient information. To ensure information suffciency, we propose a novel many-to-many mapping scheme to generate numerous high-quality initial attention maps. This can generate more attention maps without suffering low-bottleneck problems (Bhojanapalli et al., 2020). On top of these suffcient attention maps, we propose two interaction components: inner-subspace interaction (ISI) and cross-subspace interaction (CSI). These hierarchical interaction modules fully encourage consensus among attention maps of different heads.\\nThe outcome of this work is an Enhanced Interactive Transformer (EIT) architecture in that MHSA is replaced with Enhanced Multi-Head Attention (EMHA). Our proposed EIT has been demonstrated to be simple to implement and highly parameter effcient, yet it produces consistent performance improvements across a diverse set of tasks, including machine translation, grammar error correction, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. In addition, we have developed a computationally effcient variant of EIT, which, while still maintaining strong performance on several tasks, is better suited for low-latency industrial applications.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Preliminary: Multi-Head Self-Attention\",\"section_content\":\"Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is an effcient operation that can capture the interactions among tokens.

Our method mainly modifed Eq. (1) but otherwise follows the standard Transformer.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Many-to-Many Mapping Scheme\",\"section_content\":\"Intuitively, to achieve better consensus, multi-head self-attention should frst contain as much information as possible. To achieve this goal, a natural idea is to employ more attention heads in multi-head self-attention. However, multi-head self-attention with too many heads suffers from low bottleneck problems (Bhojanapalli et al., 2020), resulting in performance deterioration in practical applications.\\nAlthough various strategies like attention expansion (Shazeer et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021b) have been proposed, the information captured in their attention maps remains limited due to an additional linear transformation step, which can introduce redundancy among the maps.\\nTo alleviate this problem, we propose a novel many-to-many (M2M) mapping scheme that enables each query to attend to $M$ keys instead of a single key. As illustrated in Figure 1, four queries and four keys can serve as two components in a bipartite graph, and each element in a component, e.g., ${\\\\bf{Q}}^{1}$ , can interact with any elements in another component, e.g., $\\\\mathbf{K}^{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{K}^{4}$ . Formally, supposing one with $M$ heads, the $i$ -th attention map can be formally calculated as:\\nwhere $i\\\\in\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,M^{2}\\\\}$ , $\\\\mathbf{S}^{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{T\\\\times T}$ is the attention maps without softmax, $\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\right\\\\rfloor$ is the round down operation and $\\\\%$ is the mod operation. For example, $\\\\mathbf{S}^{4}$ is computed by ${\\\\bf{Q}}^{1}$ and ${\\\\bf K}^{4}$ when $M=4$ .\\nDiscussion. M2M demonstrates an increased capacity to generate $\\\\mathbf{M}$ times the number of attention maps when given identical input. This enhanced capability can be attributed to the effective utilization of a many-to-many mapping strategy by M2M, which fully leverages the original head features, such as $\\\\mathbf{Q}$ and $\\\\mathbf{K}$ . Notably, this approach successfully avoids the production of similar attention maps by employing a dot-multiplication strategy to directly generate the attention maps (See Figure 10). By avoiding the generation of redundant attention maps, M2M improves its ability to capture diverse and distinct patterns in the input data. As a result, it facilitates the subsequent creation of more comprehensive and informative representations. This module can also be viewed as a strategy to enhance complementary principle.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Dual Enhanced Interaction\",\"section_content\":\"As aforementioned, M2M enlarges the information capacity, which provides a prerequisite for encouraging consensus among different heads. To encourage consensus, a simple idea is to directly add a linear transformation among attention maps (Shazeer et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021b; Wang and Tu, 2020). While these methods can achieve performance improvements in vanilla Transformer settings, they are unsuitable in our framework. One key factor is that our framework contains a substantial amount of information; however, it also incorporates certain elements of noise. Such a coarse interaction fails to attain a satisfactory consensus.\\nTo address this problem, we propose a more refned solution that is able to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information, discarding the latter while fully utilizing the former. Two kinds of interactions among those attention maps are introduced hierarchically, the inner-subspace interaction and cross-subspace interaction.\\nTwo Relationships. We begin with identifying two important relationships: inner-subspace interaction (ISI) relationship and cross-subspace interaction (CSI) relationship. As illustrated in Figure 1, the inner-subspace interaction (ISI) relationship describes the connection among the attention maps generated by the same query, e.g., attention maps in the block of the same color. These attention maps own a closer relationship. The cross-subspace interaction (CSI) relationship describes the collaboration among different heads, which exists in the attention maps generated by different queries, e.g., attention maps from blocks of different colors.\\n\\nInner-Subspace Interaction Modeling. One can adopt the standard convolution operation via batch transformation. However, such a way ignores the difference among the ISI relationship constrained by different queries, e.g., the ISI relationship in red block and blue block in Figure 1. It is desirable to preserve and enhance this distinction. To more effciently model the interaction within subspaces, we therefore adopt group convolutions (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), which use separate parameters to process features from different groups.\\nSuppose $\\\\mathbf f(\\\\cdot)$ as a single layer group convolution. As illustrated in Figure 2, given the output of M2M, namely S, as input, ISI sub-module computed as:\\nwhere $\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{S}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M\\\\times T\\\\times T}$ is the output of the ISI submodule. We use $M^{H_{i s i}}$ to represent the intermediate number of heads in ISI sub-module and set the number of groups in group convolutions to $M$ .\\nFinally, we can obtain $M$ high-quality attention maps that effectively retain the benefts of using a larger number of attention heads while discarding irrelevant information. Such a process is another key for Transformer to beneft from more heads and is unique to our work.\\nCross-Subspace Interaction Modeling. To effciently model the cross-subspace interaction, we adopt two-layer convolutions accompanied by the ReLU activation to consist this sub-module.\\nLet us denote $\\\\mathbf{g}(\\\\cdot)$ as a single layer convolution. As illustrated in Figure 2, given the output of ISI, namely $\\\\dot{\\\\bf S}$ , as input, CSI sub-module computed as:\\nwhere $\\\\ddot{\\\\mathbf{S}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M\\\\times T\\\\times T}$ is the output of the CSI submodule. We use $M^{H_{c s i}}$ to represent the intermediate number of heads in CSI sub-module. Finally, we can obtain $M$ fnal attention maps that fully leverage the benefts of each head.\\nFigure 3: Illustration of dual enhanced interaction in effcient EIT $M=4$ ). We omit the ReLU for simplicity.\\nDespite the theoretical computational effciency and parametric effciency of group convolutions, they slow down the training in practice (Ma et al., 2018). To alleviate this issue, we provide another effcient version of EIT, namely E-EIT, by simplifying the design of dual enhanced interaction. As illustrated in Figure 3, both ISI and CSI adopt a single-layer operation. Formally, the dual enhanced interactions are computed as:\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{ReLU}(\\\\mathbf{f^{(0)}}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{S}\\\\right))$ , namely as $\\\\dot{\\\\bf S}$ , RMH\\u00d7T\\u00d7T a nd $\\\\ddot{\\\\textbf{S}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M\\\\times T\\\\times T}$ and $M^{H}$ is a hyper-parameter, e.g. we set it as 32 for the base confguration. In this way, E-EIT avoids parts of memory consumption and somehow improves the computational effciency.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Experiment Settings\",\"section_content\":\"We evaluated our EIT on four widely used benchmarks1: 1) Machine Translation, 2) Grammar Error Correction, 3) Abstractive Summarization, and 4) Language Modeling.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Transformer architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) have yielded promising results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). A key factor contributing to their success is the multi-head self-attention network (MHSA), which enables effcient modeling of global dependencies among tokens in parallel. Notably, instead of utilizing a single attention mechanism, MHSA uses an ensemble of attention models, each models a small subspace, and fnally aggregates these results to the fnal one. The core idea is similar to subspace learning (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) or multi-view learning (Chaudhuri et al., 2009).\\nIn the realm of multi-view learning, two fundamental principles guide the research: the complementary principle and the consensus principle (Xu et al., 2013). The complementary principle emphasizes that each data view may possess unique knowledge not present in other views, prompting the use of multiple views for a comprehensive and accurate data description. On the contrary, the consensus principle aims to maximize the agreement on multiple distinct views. However, in the context of MHSA design, most studies predominantly focus on the complementary principle. This oversight is evident in their encouragement of diverse information capture by different heads (Li et al., 2018; Cui et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2024) and the adoption of complex aggregation operations (Li et al., 2019; Wang and Tu, 2020). Some studies (Michel et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019; Behnke and Heafeld, 2020) even consider the high similarity among attention heads as a signifcant problem referred to as attention redundancy.\\nAlthough diversity is crucial in multi-view learning, Dasgupta et al. (2001) has shown that simply fusing diverse outputs does not guarantee improved results: the probability of a disagreement of two independent hypotheses upper bounds the error rate of either hypothesis. The consensus principle highlights the need to minimize disagreement among views to achieve better outcomes. In response to the consensus principle, several studies (Kumar and III, 2011; Kumar et al., 2011) have focused on minimizing disagreement among views to achieve better outcomes. However, in the context of MHSA research, there is a tendency to prioritize complementarity over consensus among different attention heads. Here we ask a question: Can balancing these two principles beneft the design of MHSA mechanisms?\\nHowever, encouraging such a consensus in multihead self-attention is challenging. In our preliminary experiments, we found that directly utilizing regularization terms can achieve this goal but cannot improve performance. Drawing inspirations from human behavior where group discussions and interactions foster consensus, we propose introducing interactions among different subspaces in MHSA to achieve consensus.\\n\\nTo this end, we propose a new multi-head self-attention variant: Enhanced Multi-Head SelfAttention, which encourages consensus among attention heads while guaranteeing to contain suffcient information. To ensure information suffciency, we propose a novel many-to-many mapping scheme to generate numerous high-quality initial attention maps. This can generate more attention maps without suffering low-bottleneck problems (Bhojanapalli et al., 2020). On top of these suffcient attention maps, we propose two interaction components: inner-subspace interaction (ISI) and cross-subspace interaction (CSI). These hierarchical interaction modules fully encourage consensus among attention maps of different heads.\\nThe outcome of this work is an Enhanced Interactive Transformer (EIT) architecture in that MHSA is replaced with Enhanced Multi-Head Attention (EMHA). Our proposed EIT has been demonstrated to be simple to implement and highly parameter effcient, yet it produces consistent performance improvements across a diverse set of tasks, including machine translation, grammar error correction, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. In addition, we have developed a computationally effcient variant of EIT, which, while still maintaining strong performance on several tasks, is better suited for low-latency industrial applications.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
