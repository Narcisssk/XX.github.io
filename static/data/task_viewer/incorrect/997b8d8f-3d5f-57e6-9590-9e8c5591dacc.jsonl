{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

LLMs on the other hand have a rich reservoir of cultural knowledge embedded within its parameters that can be potentially exploited for such applications. In this paper, we defne the task of cultural adaptation and create an evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of modern LLMs for cultural adaptation and analyze their crosscultural knowledge while connecting related concepts across different cultures.

Though LLMs have not achieved state-of-the-art performance for machine translation (Zhu et al., 2023), their instructionfollowing ability makes them suitable for tasks involving more creativity and customization during generation. Many translation applications require literal translations for which specialized transformer-based models trained on parallel data are ideal. However, there are other facets of translation (see Figure 2), such as adaptation, also called the \\u2018freest\\u2019 form of translation (Newmark, 1988) wherein the original text is rewritten to make it more appropriate for the target audience belonging to a specifc age group or culture (See Figure 1). Applications of adaptation (Appendix E) include adapted transcriptions for plays, poetry, and movie subtitles where the plot, characters and central theme are usually kept intact but the text is rewritten to ensure the output is sensitive to the target culture. Adaptation can either be done within the same (intralingual adaptation) or in different languages (interlingual adaptation).\\n\\nPolizzotti (2018) in his book \\u201cSympathy for the Traitor: The Translation Manifesto\\\" describes how in 17th century France, a sexist term belles infd\\u00e8les (the beautiful, unfaithful ones) was used to describe the prevalent approach to French translations at the time, which involved \\u201cupdating\\\" ancient Greek and Latin texts by removing vulgar language or sexual content and replacing outdated references with modern equivalents to make the texts more easily understandable and socially acceptable. These translations were considered \\u201cbeautiful\\\" because they were smooth to read and met contemporary expectations, but they were not faithful to the original texts in a strict sense. The debate between \\\"literalism\\\" and \\\"adaptation\\\" persists, with proponents of each arguing their merits. Yet, adaptations of existing texts continue to serve diverse purposes including cross-cultural communication.\\nIn this study, we steer clear of this debate and explore this task purely from an NLP perspective particularly investigating the power of large language models. We defne a specifc version of the task along with clear goals and an evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness of these adaptations considering factors such as localisation, preservation, naturalness, and appropriateness. The motivation behind this work stems from the need to transcend the constraints of literal translation and explore freer forms of translation such as adaptation. Due to the rising creativity, multilinguality, cross-cultural knowledge and instruction-following ability of modern language models, they have the potential to generate culturally resonant adaptations of the source text.\\nWe limit our study to cultural adaptation with English as the source and target language i.e. Intralingual adaptation. As Hershcovich et al. (2022) argues, although language and culture are interconnected, they are not synonymous. For example, English, being the lingua franca for many parts of the world, can carry views and concepts from different parts of the world. By sticking to English, we can specifcally evaluate how well cultural aspects are adjusted in adaptation without the added complexity of translating between languages. As LLMs become more multilingual (in generation and understanding), their ability can better be evaluated for interlingual adaptation and related aspects of this study can be applied there. We can also view Interlingual Cultural Adaptation as a combination of Intralingual Cultural Adaptation and Machine Translation.\\nWe explore the following research questions and contribute along these: RQ 1) How do we defne what constitutes adaptation in terms of modifcations to the source text i.e. what is changed during adaptation and for what purpose? RQ 2) Based on the goals of adaptation, what are the optimal criteria\\/aspects for evaluation? RQ 3) Given the evaluation, how profcient are modern language models at adaptation? What strategies do they employ, and to what extent do they adapt based on provided instructions? RQ 4) What insights does this offer into their parametric cross-cultural knowledge?\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Yao et al. (2023) discusses the aspect of using cultural knowledge to support LLM-based translation. They focus on literal translation and create a culture-specifc parallel corpus, to evaluate the cultural awareness of MT systems. They explored different prompting strategies using external and internal knowledge for LLM-based machine translation and created an automatic evaluation metric, to measure the translation quality of cultural concepts.\\nRecent works on evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs have centred primarily around measuring cultural value alignment (Durmus et al., 2023; Cao et al., 2023; Masoud et al., 2023; Ramezani and Xu, 2023). While this is important, it does not necessarily indicate that LLMs are aware of culturespecifc items or concepts from different cultures. More research is needed to assess whether LLMs truly understand these culture-specifc items and concepts and can use them coherently in text. Our research aims to address this question.\\nJiang and Joshi (2023) created a ranking-based statistical QA task that compared cultural concept popularity across countries. Wang et al. (2024) examined the cultural dominance of concrete (e.g., holidays and songs) and abstract (e.g., values and opinions) cultural objects in LLM responses.\\nPeskov et al. (2021) introduced the idea of automatic cultural adaptation by adapting named entities across cultures and languages, however, it focused on simpler entities in standalone sentences. Cao et al. (2024) constructed resources for cultural adaptation of recipes and also evaluated their method against LLM-based adaptation. More recently, Zhang et al. (2024) created Chinese-English menu corpora and defned an evaluation for the task\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Task Defnition\",\"section_content\":\"For the task of adaptation, we use a corpus of dialogs from a TV show and adapt it to the target culture. We choose adaptation of dialogs instead of standalone sentences as done by Peskov et al. (2021) since they provide richer context and are more representative of a true use case of adaptation. The original corpus of dialogues is denoted as $D_{o}~=~\\\\{d_{1}^{o},d_{2}^{o},\\\\ldots,d_{n}^{o}\\\\}$ . We obtain an adapted version of these dialogues denoted as ${\\\\cal D}_{a}=\\\\{f(d_{1}^{o},c),f(d_{2}^{o},c),\\\\ldots,f(d_{n}^{o},c)\\\\}$ , where $f$ represents the language model that adapts the original dialogues to the target culture and $c$ is the specifc cultural context or prompt representing the cultural context for adaptation. Each dialogue $d$ consists of a number of utterances i.e. $\\\\textit{d}=\\\\ \\\\{u_{1},u_{2},\\\\ldots,u_{m}\\\\}$ . Each utterance $\\\\boldsymbol{u}_{i}=$ speaker $(u_{i})$ : text $(u_{i})$ , where $s p e a k e r(u_{i})$ is the speaker or participant name and $(u_{i})$ is the textual content for utterance $u_{i}$ . Our task is to evaluate how well dialogues in the adapted set $D_{a}$ are culturally aligned to the target culture while maintaining the intent and essence of the original dialogue. Section 4 provides details on the exact aspects along which we assess these adaptations.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Annotating Cultural References\",\"section_content\":\"Corpus Description: We choose the \\u2018Friends Dialogs\\u2019 corpus for this study. We flter the data to choose dialogues with utterances between 1 and 15. The corpus includes 1110 conversations (or dialogs) containing 11812 utterances by 363 speakers. The reason for choosing such a corpus is that \\u2018Friends TV Show\\u2019 is deeply rooted in American culture offering a distinct contrast that highlights the need for adaptation when targeting a new cultural context, specifcally India1 in our study. Here, adaptation ensures that the message is not only understood but also embraced and valued in a different cultural environment.\\nCulture is a multi-faceted concept. Many scholars have tried to defne culture. One such theory which is very relevant here and is also mentioned in cultural translation studies is Hall\\u2019s\\nIceberg Model of Culture (or the Triad of Culture) which divides aspects of culture into three levels: visible (above the waterline), semi-visible and invisible (see Figure 3) which are referred as the technical, formal and informal level of culture, respectively. As Katan (2014) describes, these levels also relate to how we grasp culture: technical culture can be taught by an expert, formal culture through trial-and-error while informal culture is learned unconsciously.\\nAt the tip of the iceberg i.e. the technical level, the goal of translation is to transfer the terms and concepts of the source text to the target text with minimal loss. The terms and concepts are usually referred to as \\u201cculture-bound\\u201d terms, or \\u201cculturemes\\u201d. Hall\\u2019s second level, i.e., the Formal level of culture focuses on rituals, customs, and accepted or appropriate ways of doing things. This level follows the \\u2018Skopos Theory\\u2019 (Vermeer, 1989) i.e translation should be oriented towards achieving the desired function in the target culture, rather than being faithful to the source text. Hall\\u2019s third level, i.e., the Informal level cannot be taught or learned but is acquired \\u2018out-of-awareness\\u2019 or unconsciously. This is what makes a translation more artistic rather than mechanistic.\\nRQ 1: How do we defne what constitutes adaptation in terms of modifcations to the source text i.e. what is changed during adaptation and for what purpose? In this study, we mainly focus on the frst two levels of culture. In order to evaluate whether an adaptation navigates different levels of culture, we need to annotate culturerelated references in the source text and look at how they are being adapted in the corresponding adaptation. We call these items adaptable items or Culture-Specifc Items(CSI) used by Newmark (1988).\\n\\nItems which can undergo adaptation include references to concepts and realities which are foreign to the target culture, socially sensitive and taboo topics, colloquialisms, slang, idioms, fgures of speech, humour, or content which can be considered offensive in the target culture. We manually annotate these items in our corpus of dialogues. We also categorise these items into the following categories $:1$ ) Ecology ((fora, fauna, winds etc.) 2) Material Culture (artefacts, food, clothes, houses, towns, transport etc.) 3) Social Culture (work and leisure) 4) Institutions, Organizations and ideas (political, social, religious, social, artistic, administrative, ideas etc.) 5) Gestures and Habits (name of regular behaviour and movements), as proposed by Newmark (1988). Additionally, we introduce four more categories which refect the need for adaptation: 6) Slang or Figure of Speech, 7) Offensive Content, 8) Socially Sensitive or Taboo Topics and 9) Humour (Since \\u2018Friends\\u2019 is a sitcom). We use the descriptions from Newmark (1988) plus descriptions of the other four categories as our annotation guidelines.\\nWhile Yao et al. (2023) demonstrates an automated approach to annotating culture-bound items, however, for our use case, we observed that it only identifes a fraction of items which can undergo adaptation. Also, CSI are culture-specifc not due to their origin but also due to their foreignness to the target culture. For example, sausage is common in both the USA and the UK but still foreign in Indian culture, so manually annotating these items based on the foreignness to the target culture is desired. This is especially important due to the \\u201cMcDonaldization of Society\\\" (Ritzer, 1996) where cultural boundaries are becoming blurred and the notion of foreignness is constantly evolving due to migration and cultural exchange. Therefore, we also annotate the degree of foreignness to the target audience to provide a more accurate depiction and expectation since items that are more foreign to the target culture should be more likely to undergo adaptation. We defne 3 foreignness levels: 1,2 and 3 for our annotation. Foreignness level 1 consists of items\\/behaviours which have traceable foreign origin\\/usage however they are common (in terms of familiarity, integration and perception) in the target culture. For example, pizza, chocolate, cricket and coffee are fairly common in India. We omit items in foreignness level 1 from our analysis. For items with foreignness level 2, they may be recognized in the target culture, but their usage or signifcance is somewhat foreign or less familiar. For example, sushi, tacos, $\\\\mathbf{k}$ -pop and beer are not very common and not fully assimilated or mainstream in India. Items in foreignness level 3 are largely unfamiliar or perceived as distinctly foreign within the target culture. Some examples include kimono, rodeo, thanksgiving etc. which are largely unknown to the Indian audience.\\n\\nHuman annotation: We hired three human annotators from India for our study (both annotation and human evaluation (Section 7.2)), who were able to understand different aspects and sensitivities of Indian culture expressed through English. The annotators were aware of the source (\\u201cUSA\\\" as a proxy) culture and good at identifying what aspects of it are foreign to India and to what extent. They were instructed to annotate2 for these cultural items in the corpus, their categories and foreignness level.\\nRecent studies (Schaekermann et al., 2018; Drapeau et al., 2016) have indicated that deliberation can enhance the quality of answers and even a small number of debates can outperform the wisdom of large crowds (Navajas et al., 2017). Therefore, in this study, annotations were carried out using deliberation through verbal discussion until a consensus was reached.\\nSome examples of CSI for different categories or foreignness levels are given in Table 1. The number of occurrences of these CSI for each category\\/foreignness is shown in Figure 4. The corpus is publicly accessible3.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Evaluation of Cultural Adaptation\",\"section_content\":\"In order to design an evaluation framework for adaptation, we need to understand the motivation and goals behind it. In the following section, we mention some goals of adaptation which are aspects along which we assess the quality of cultural\\nadaptation.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5.1 Aspects of Evaluation\",\"section_content\":\"RQ 2: Based on the goals of adaptation, what are the optimal criteria\\/aspects for evaluation? Adaptation can be used for a variety of applications4 and the goals will vary for each application be it marketing, children\\u2019s literature, or creative content translation. However, the main goal of adaptation is to serve the target audience, even if it means being unfaithful to the original text. This means that one of the goals is to achieve a shift in cultural levels to make the text more familiar and appropriate to the target culture by adapting more items in the source text. The greater the Extent of Cultural Adaptation or Localisation, the higher the chances it will be accepted by the target audience. Another obvious goal of adaptation is Cultural Appropriateness and Sensitivity i.e. respecting the sensitivities of the target culture without being offensive and avoiding propagation of harmful stereotypes. Sometimes, items adapted to the target culture may not ft well or might appear forced or unnatural. Thus, another goal is Naturalness i.e. that adaptation must appear natural and coherent. Changes done to the source text should not disrupt the fow of the text. As mentioned earlier, adaptation used for plays, poetry, drama etc keeps the characters and the central theme intact and only modifes cultural elements. This means that another goal of adaptation is Content Preservation. We want adaptation to preserve the original meaning and intent of the dialogue and it should not distort the main message. Since we are dealing with intralingual cultural adaptation, it is very similar to text style transfer (Mir et al., 2019) which also uses metrics like style transfer intensity (in our case, extent of cultural adaptation), content preservation and naturalness. In order to evaluate cultural adaptations along these aspects, we perform two types of analysis: 1) edit level analysis, 2) dialogue level analysis.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5.2 Edit Level Analysis\",\"section_content\":\"$\\\\%$ CSI edited: We defne a proxy metric to measure the extent of cultural adaptation i.e. $\\\\%$ Of CSI edited. We use the annotations in our source corpus and using fuzzy string matching5, we calculate what percentage of cultural elements that we have annotated in source text also appear in translation. If they do that means they aren\\u2019t adapted\\/edited. Using this we can calculate $\\\\%$ CSI edited as :\\n$\\\\%$ CSI edited $=100\\\\textrm{-}\\\\%$ of CSI found in adaptations This metric is not very informative of the 5https:\\/\\/github.com\\/seatgeek\\/thefuzz\\nquality of edits performed on items or whether that edit was correct or appropriate, however, it does quantify the extent of change or adaptation. We also report $\\\\%{\\\\bf C S I}$ edited for each category and foreignness level.\\nAspect Evaluation: For aspect-based evaluation at the edit level, we rate each individual edit on 3 aspects: localization, correctness in context and offensiveness. During adaptation, many edits are also performed on items which are culturally neutral. This is usually done to make the text more localized by creating new cultural items. Therefore we need to identify all edits whether they are on CSI or non-CSI. While there are libraries which can help to identify edits, we observed that LLMs are more suitable for such a task given their language understanding ability. We use Mixtral6(Jiang et al., 2024) for automatic evaluation in our experiments including identifying edits in each utterance for all the dialogues. Then we ask the LLM to rate each edit on 3 aspects : 1) Correctness (0 or 1), 2) Localization (0 or 1 or 2), 3) Offensiveness(0 or 1) The prompts used for obtaining edits and rating them on these aspects are given in Appendix B. These aspects somewhat relate to the aspects described in Section 5.1. Correctness relates to Naturalness, Localization to Extent of Cultural Adaptation and Offensiveness to Cultural Appropriateness. However, it\\u2019s important to note that aspect evaluation at the edit level may not account for the entire context of the dialog but for the edit and the context in which it is used. Once we obtain these ratings, we can analyze and compare adaptations from different LLMs in terms of 1) percentage of correct edits, 2) Average edit localization score and 3) percentage of offensive edits.\\nTranslation Strategies: For each edit corresponding to source culture CSI, we determine the strategy used for adaptation. According to Davies (2003), the following strategies can be used while translating CSI: 1) Preservation, 2) Addition, 3) Omission, 4) Localisation, 5) Globalisation, 6) Transformation and 7) Creation. The prompt for determining the translation strategy for a given CSI edit is given in Appendix B, which also contains a description of these strategies. In the context of intralingual adaptation, \\u2018preservation\\u2019 corresponds to no edit. \\u2018Creation\\u2019 corresponds to edits where non-CSI are edited to CSI. We perform the analysis for CSI edits and classify them based on the strategy used.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}

An aspect of translation that often gets overlooked is that of cultural adaptation, or modifying source culture references to suit the target culture. While specialized translation models still outperform LLMs on the machine translation task when viewed from the lens of correctness, they are not sensitive to cultural differences often requiring manual correction. LLMs on the other hand have a rich reservoir of cultural knowledge embedded within its parameters that can be potentially exploited for such applications. In this paper, we defne the task of cultural adaptation and create an evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of modern LLMs for cultural adaptation and analyze their crosscultural knowledge while connecting related concepts across different cultures. We also analyze possible issues with automatic adaptation. We hope that this task will offer more insight into the cultural understanding of LLMs and their creativity in cross-cultural scenarios.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Recent progress in NLP is largely driven via LLMs, which have shown great promise in a variety of tasks including text generation, language understanding, question answering, code generation, and even machine translation. Though LLMs have not achieved state-of-the-art performance for machine translation (Zhu et al., 2023), their instructionfollowing ability makes them suitable for tasks involving more creativity and customization during generation. Many translation applications require literal translations for which specialized transformer-based models trained on parallel data are ideal. However, there are other facets of translation (see Figure 2), such as adaptation, also called the \\u2018freest\\u2019 form of translation (Newmark, 1988) wherein the original text is rewritten to make it more appropriate for the target audience belonging to a specifc age group or culture (See Figure 1). Applications of adaptation (Appendix E) include adapted transcriptions for plays, poetry, and movie subtitles where the plot, characters and central theme are usually kept intact but the text is rewritten to ensure the output is sensitive to the target culture. Adaptation can either be done within the same (intralingual adaptation) or in different languages (interlingual adaptation).\\n\\nPolizzotti (2018) in his book \\u201cSympathy for the Traitor: The Translation Manifesto\\\" describes how in 17th century France, a sexist term belles infd\\u00e8les (the beautiful, unfaithful ones) was used to describe the prevalent approach to French translations at the time, which involved \\u201cupdating\\\" ancient Greek and Latin texts by removing vulgar language or sexual content and replacing outdated references with modern equivalents to make the texts more easily understandable and socially acceptable. These translations were considered \\u201cbeautiful\\\" because they were smooth to read and met contemporary expectations, but they were not faithful to the original texts in a strict sense. The debate between \\\"literalism\\\" and \\\"adaptation\\\" persists, with proponents of each arguing their merits. Yet, adaptations of existing texts continue to serve diverse purposes including cross-cultural communication.\\nIn this study, we steer clear of this debate and explore this task purely from an NLP perspective particularly investigating the power of large language models. We defne a specifc version of the task along with clear goals and an evaluation framework for assessing the effectiveness of these adaptations considering factors such as localisation, preservation, naturalness, and appropriateness. The motivation behind this work stems from the need to transcend the constraints of literal translation and explore freer forms of translation such as adaptation. Due to the rising creativity, multilinguality, cross-cultural knowledge and instruction-following ability of modern language models, they have the potential to generate culturally resonant adaptations of the source text.\\nWe limit our study to cultural adaptation with English as the source and target language i.e. Intralingual adaptation. As Hershcovich et al. (2022) argues, although language and culture are interconnected, they are not synonymous. For example, English, being the lingua franca for many parts of the world, can carry views and concepts from different parts of the world. By sticking to English, we can specifcally evaluate how well cultural aspects are adjusted in adaptation without the added complexity of translating between languages. As LLMs become more multilingual (in generation and understanding), their ability can better be evaluated for interlingual adaptation and related aspects of this study can be applied there. We can also view Interlingual Cultural Adaptation as a combination of Intralingual Cultural Adaptation and Machine Translation.\\nWe explore the following research questions and contribute along these: RQ 1) How do we defne what constitutes adaptation in terms of modifcations to the source text i.e. what is changed during adaptation and for what purpose? RQ 2) Based on the goals of adaptation, what are the optimal criteria\\/aspects for evaluation? RQ 3) Given the evaluation, how profcient are modern language models at adaptation? What strategies do they employ, and to what extent do they adapt based on provided instructions? RQ 4) What insights does this offer into their parametric cross-cultural knowledge?\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Yao et al. (2023) discusses the aspect of using cultural knowledge to support LLM-based translation. They focus on literal translation and create a culture-specifc parallel corpus, to evaluate the cultural awareness of MT systems. They explored different prompting strategies using external and internal knowledge for LLM-based machine translation and created an automatic evaluation metric, to measure the translation quality of cultural concepts.\\nRecent works on evaluating cultural awareness in LLMs have centred primarily around measuring cultural value alignment (Durmus et al., 2023; Cao et al., 2023; Masoud et al., 2023; Ramezani and Xu, 2023). While this is important, it does not necessarily indicate that LLMs are aware of culturespecifc items or concepts from different cultures. More research is needed to assess whether LLMs truly understand these culture-specifc items and concepts and can use them coherently in text. Our research aims to address this question.\\nJiang and Joshi (2023) created a ranking-based statistical QA task that compared cultural concept popularity across countries. Wang et al. (2024) examined the cultural dominance of concrete (e.g., holidays and songs) and abstract (e.g., values and opinions) cultural objects in LLM responses.\\nPeskov et al. (2021) introduced the idea of automatic cultural adaptation by adapting named entities across cultures and languages, however, it focused on simpler entities in standalone sentences. Cao et al. (2024) constructed resources for cultural adaptation of recipes and also evaluated their method against LLM-based adaptation. More recently, Zhang et al. (2024) created Chinese-English menu corpora and defned an evaluation for the task\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"For the task of adaptation, we use a corpus of dialogs from a TV show and adapt it to the target culture. We choose adaptation of dialogs instead of standalone sentences as done by Peskov et al. (2021) since they provide richer context and are more representative of a true use case of adaptation. The original corpus of dialogues is denoted as $D_{o}~=~\\\\{d_{1}^{o},d_{2}^{o},\\\\ldots,d_{n}^{o}\\\\}$ . We obtain an adapted version of these dialogues denoted as ${\\\\cal D}_{a}=\\\\{f(d_{1}^{o},c),f(d_{2}^{o},c),\\\\ldots,f(d_{n}^{o},c)\\\\}$ , where $f$ represents the language model that adapts the original dialogues to the target culture and $c$ is the specifc cultural context or prompt representing the cultural context for adaptation.

Each utterance $\\\\boldsymbol{u}_{i}=$ speaker $(u_{i})$ : text $(u_{i})$ , where $s p e a k e r(u_{i})$ is the speaker or participant name and $(u_{i})$ is the textual content for utterance $u_{i}$ . Our task is to evaluate how well dialogues in the adapted set $D_{a}$ are culturally aligned to the target culture while maintaining the intent and essence of the original dialogue. Section 4 provides details on the exact aspects along which we assess these adaptations.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Corpus Description: We choose the \\u2018Friends Dialogs\\u2019 corpus for this study. We flter the data to choose dialogues with utterances between 1 and 15. The corpus includes 1110 conversations (or dialogs) containing 11812 utterances by 363 speakers. The reason for choosing such a corpus is that \\u2018Friends TV Show\\u2019 is deeply rooted in American culture offering a distinct contrast that highlights the need for adaptation when targeting a new cultural context, specifcally India1 in our study. Here, adaptation ensures that the message is not only understood but also embraced and valued in a different cultural environment.\\nCulture is a multi-faceted concept. Many scholars have tried to defne culture. One such theory which is very relevant here and is also mentioned in cultural translation studies is Hall\\u2019s\\nIceberg Model of Culture (or the Triad of Culture) which divides aspects of culture into three levels: visible (above the waterline), semi-visible and invisible (see Figure 3) which are referred as the technical, formal and informal level of culture, respectively. As Katan (2014) describes, these levels also relate to how we grasp culture: technical culture can be taught by an expert, formal culture through trial-and-error while informal culture is learned unconsciously.\\nAt the tip of the iceberg i.e. the technical level, the goal of translation is to transfer the terms and concepts of the source text to the target text with minimal loss. The terms and concepts are usually referred to as \\u201cculture-bound\\u201d terms, or \\u201cculturemes\\u201d. Hall\\u2019s second level, i.e., the Formal level of culture focuses on rituals, customs, and accepted or appropriate ways of doing things. This level follows the \\u2018Skopos Theory\\u2019 (Vermeer, 1989) i.e translation should be oriented towards achieving the desired function in the target culture, rather than being faithful to the source text. Hall\\u2019s third level, i.e., the Informal level cannot be taught or learned but is acquired \\u2018out-of-awareness\\u2019 or unconsciously. This is what makes a translation more artistic rather than mechanistic.\\nRQ 1: How do we defne what constitutes adaptation in terms of modifcations to the source text i.e. what is changed during adaptation and for what purpose? In this study, we mainly focus on the frst two levels of culture. In order to evaluate whether an adaptation navigates different levels of culture, we need to annotate culturerelated references in the source text and look at how they are being adapted in the corresponding adaptation. We call these items adaptable items or Culture-Specifc Items(CSI) used by Newmark (1988).\\n\\nItems which can undergo adaptation include references to concepts and realities which are foreign to the target culture, socially sensitive and taboo topics, colloquialisms, slang, idioms, fgures of speech, humour, or content which can be considered offensive in the target culture. We manually annotate these items in our corpus of dialogues. We also categorise these items into the following categories $:1$ ) Ecology ((fora, fauna, winds etc.) 2) Material Culture (artefacts, food, clothes, houses, towns, transport etc.) 3) Social Culture (work and leisure) 4) Institutions, Organizations and ideas (political, social, religious, social, artistic, administrative, ideas etc.) 5) Gestures and Habits (name of regular behaviour and movements), as proposed by Newmark (1988). Additionally, we introduce four more categories which refect the need for adaptation: 6) Slang or Figure of Speech, 7) Offensive Content, 8) Socially Sensitive or Taboo Topics and 9) Humour (Since \\u2018Friends\\u2019 is a sitcom). We use the descriptions from Newmark (1988) plus descriptions of the other four categories as our annotation guidelines.\\nWhile Yao et al. (2023) demonstrates an automated approach to annotating culture-bound items, however, for our use case, we observed that it only identifes a fraction of items which can undergo adaptation. Also, CSI are culture-specifc not due to their origin but also due to their foreignness to the target culture. For example, sausage is common in both the USA and the UK but still foreign in Indian culture, so manually annotating these items based on the foreignness to the target culture is desired. This is especially important due to the \\u201cMcDonaldization of Society\\\" (Ritzer, 1996) where cultural boundaries are becoming blurred and the notion of foreignness is constantly evolving due to migration and cultural exchange. Therefore, we also annotate the degree of foreignness to the target audience to provide a more accurate depiction and expectation since items that are more foreign to the target culture should be more likely to undergo adaptation. We defne 3 foreignness levels: 1,2 and 3 for our annotation. Foreignness level 1 consists of items\\/behaviours which have traceable foreign origin\\/usage however they are common (in terms of familiarity, integration and perception) in the target culture. For example, pizza, chocolate, cricket and coffee are fairly common in India. We omit items in foreignness level 1 from our analysis. For items with foreignness level 2, they may be recognized in the target culture, but their usage or signifcance is somewhat foreign or less familiar. For example, sushi, tacos, $\\\\mathbf{k}$ -pop and beer are not very common and not fully assimilated or mainstream in India. Items in foreignness level 3 are largely unfamiliar or perceived as distinctly foreign within the target culture. Some examples include kimono, rodeo, thanksgiving etc. which are largely unknown to the Indian audience.\\n\\nHuman annotation: We hired three human annotators from India for our study (both annotation and human evaluation (Section 7.2)), who were able to understand different aspects and sensitivities of Indian culture expressed through English. The annotators were aware of the source (\\u201cUSA\\\" as a proxy) culture and good at identifying what aspects of it are foreign to India and to what extent. They were instructed to annotate2 for these cultural items in the corpus, their categories and foreignness level.\\nRecent studies (Schaekermann et al., 2018; Drapeau et al., 2016) have indicated that deliberation can enhance the quality of answers and even a small number of debates can outperform the wisdom of large crowds (Navajas et al., 2017). Therefore, in this study, annotations were carried out using deliberation through verbal discussion until a consensus was reached.\\nSome examples of CSI for different categories or foreignness levels are given in Table 1. The number of occurrences of these CSI for each category\\/foreignness is shown in Figure 4. The corpus is publicly accessible3.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In order to design an evaluation framework for adaptation, we need to understand the motivation and goals behind it. In the following section, we mention some goals of adaptation which are aspects along which we assess the quality of cultural\\nadaptation.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"RQ 2: Based on the goals of adaptation, what are the optimal criteria\\/aspects for evaluation? Adaptation can be used for a variety of applications4 and the goals will vary for each application be it marketing, children\\u2019s literature, or creative content translation. However, the main goal of adaptation is to serve the target audience, even if it means being unfaithful to the original text. This means that one of the goals is to achieve a shift in cultural levels to make the text more familiar and appropriate to the target culture by adapting more items in the source text. The greater the Extent of Cultural Adaptation or Localisation, the higher the chances it will be accepted by the target audience. Another obvious goal of adaptation is Cultural Appropriateness and Sensitivity i.e. respecting the sensitivities of the target culture without being offensive and avoiding propagation of harmful stereotypes. Sometimes, items adapted to the target culture may not ft well or might appear forced or unnatural. Thus, another goal is Naturalness i.e. that adaptation must appear natural and coherent. Changes done to the source text should not disrupt the fow of the text. As mentioned earlier, adaptation used for plays, poetry, drama etc keeps the characters and the central theme intact and only modifes cultural elements. This means that another goal of adaptation is Content Preservation. We want adaptation to preserve the original meaning and intent of the dialogue and it should not distort the main message. Since we are dealing with intralingual cultural adaptation, it is very similar to text style transfer (Mir et al., 2019) which also uses metrics like style transfer intensity (in our case, extent of cultural adaptation), content preservation and naturalness. In order to evaluate cultural adaptations along these aspects, we perform two types of analysis: 1) edit level analysis, 2) dialogue level analysis.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"$\\\\%$ CSI edited: We defne a proxy metric to measure the extent of cultural adaptation i.e. $\\\\%$ Of CSI edited. We use the annotations in our source corpus and using fuzzy string matching5, we calculate what percentage of cultural elements that we have annotated in source text also appear in translation. If they do that means they aren\\u2019t adapted\\/edited. Using this we can calculate $\\\\%$ CSI edited as :\\n$\\\\%$ CSI edited $=100\\\\textrm{-}\\\\%$ of CSI found in adaptations This metric is not very informative of the 5https:\\/\\/github.com\\/seatgeek\\/thefuzz\\nquality of edits performed on items or whether that edit was correct or appropriate, however, it does quantify the extent of change or adaptation. We also report $\\\\%{\\\\bf C S I}$ edited for each category and foreignness level.\\nAspect Evaluation: For aspect-based evaluation at the edit level, we rate each individual edit on 3 aspects: localization, correctness in context and offensiveness. During adaptation, many edits are also performed on items which are culturally neutral. This is usually done to make the text more localized by creating new cultural items. Therefore we need to identify all edits whether they are on CSI or non-CSI. While there are libraries which can help to identify edits, we observed that LLMs are more suitable for such a task given their language understanding ability. We use Mixtral6(Jiang et al., 2024) for automatic evaluation in our experiments including identifying edits in each utterance for all the dialogues. Then we ask the LLM to rate each edit on 3 aspects : 1) Correctness (0 or 1), 2) Localization (0 or 1 or 2), 3) Offensiveness(0 or 1) The prompts used for obtaining edits and rating them on these aspects are given in Appendix B. These aspects somewhat relate to the aspects described in Section 5.1. Correctness relates to Naturalness, Localization to Extent of Cultural Adaptation and Offensiveness to Cultural Appropriateness. However, it\\u2019s important to note that aspect evaluation at the edit level may not account for the entire context of the dialog but for the edit and the context in which it is used. Once we obtain these ratings, we can analyze and compare adaptations from different LLMs in terms of 1) percentage of correct edits, 2) Average edit localization score and 3) percentage of offensive edits.\\nTranslation Strategies: For each edit corresponding to source culture CSI, we determine the strategy used for adaptation. According to Davies (2003), the following strategies can be used while translating CSI: 1) Preservation, 2) Addition, 3) Omission, 4) Localisation, 5) Globalisation, 6) Transformation and 7) Creation. The prompt for determining the translation strategy for a given CSI edit is given in Appendix B, which also contains a description of these strategies. In the context of intralingual adaptation, \\u2018preservation\\u2019 corresponds to no edit. \\u2018Creation\\u2019 corresponds to edits where non-CSI are edited to CSI. We perform the analysis for CSI edits and classify them based on the strategy used.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}

The algo-\\nrithms differ in whether they use history information (MLP back-\\nbones for no history, Transformer\\/GPT backbones for history-\\nbased models), whether they predict future action sequences (sin-\\ngle actions\\/SA or action chunking\\/AC, Transformer-Encoder-\\nDecoder\\/T-EncDec backbones for AC) and how they model di-\\nverse behavior (last column).\\nWe benchmark a large set of\\nrecent imitation learning algo-\\nrithms.\\nThese algorithms can\\nbe categorized along three axes.\\nThe first axis specifies whether\\nthe algorithms are using a his-\\ntory of state observations. For\\nalgorithms that do not use his-\\ntory (Sohn et al., 2015; Flo-\\nrence et al., 2022), a standard\\nMLP is used as backbone ar-\\nchitecture,\\nwhile for history-\\ndependent policies (Shafiullah\\net\\nal.,\\n2022;\\nPearce\\net\\nal.,\\n2023; Reuss et al., 2023; Chi\\net al., 2023) we use a causal\\nmasked Transformer Decoder\\n(GPT) based on the implemen-\\ntation of BeT (Shafiullah et al.,\\n2022) as backbone as this archi-\\ntecture has been also adopted by other recent approaches. In our experiments, we use a history of\\nk = 5. The second axis categorizes whether the algorithms are predicting only a single action or the\\nfuture action sequence (Zhao et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023), which has been recently introduced as\\n5\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\naction chunking which has been shown to improve performance in some tasks. For action chunking\\nmodels, we use a Transformer Encoder Decoder structure (T-EncDec) (Vaswani et al., 2017) based\\non the implementation of VAE-ACT (Zhao et al., 2023). The third axis categorizes how the algo-\\nrithms capture behavior diversity. Standard deterministic models are not able to do so, while more\\nrecent models use clustering (Shafiullah et al., 2022), VAEs (Zhao et al., 2023; Sohn et al., 2015),\\nimplicit models (Florence et al., 2022) as well as discrete-time (Pearce et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023),\\nor continuous time diffusion models (Reuss et al., 2023). To improve our understanding of the in-\\nfluence of the specific design choices, we also evaluate new variants of these combinations such as\\nhistory-free (MLP-based) action clustering (BeT-MLP). The full table of used algorithmic setups is\\ndepicted in Table 2. A more detailed description of all model architectures is given in Appendix C.\\n4.2\\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nWe briefly outline the most important aspects of our experimental setup.\\nEvaluation Protocol. To assess a model\\u2019s ability to capture diverse behavior, we propose the behav-\\nior entropy and the conditional behavior entropy (Section 3.1). For the former, we perform multiple\\nsimulations, from which we compute the model\\u2019s behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2). For the latter, we use\\na randomly sampled but fixed set of initial states s0 and perform multiple simulations for each s0\\nin order to compute the conditional behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0). Alongside the entropy, we also\\nreport the success rate which is the fraction of simulations that led to successful task completion.\\nState \\/ Observation Representation. For most experiments, we provide state representation and\\nimage observations. For the former, we use handcrafted features that work well empirically. For the\\nlatter, we used two different camera views, in-hand and front view with a 96 \\u00d7 96 image resolution.\\nWe follow Chi et al. (2023) and use a ResNet-18 architecture as an image encoder for all methods.\\nModel Selection. Model selection is challenging as the training objective does not coincide with\\ntask performance (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Paine et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021; Mandlekar et al., 2021).\\nMoreover, policy performance can exhibit substantial variations from one training epoch to another\\n(Mandlekar et al., 2021). For image-based experiments we evaluate the task performance frequently\\n(after every 1\\/10th of total training) and chose the model with the best task-performance. Due to\\nhigh-computational demand for simulation, we split the dataset into training (90%) and validation\\n(10%) and chose the model with the lowest validation loss for state-based experiments. We ensure\\nthat the training converges by using 500 epochs for state representation and 200 for image obser-\\nvations. We extensively tune the most important hyperparameters of all methods using Bayesian\\noptimization (Snoek et al., 2012). We report the mean and the standard deviation over six random\\nseeds for all experiments.\\n4.3\\nBENCHMARK USING STATE REPRESENTATION\\nWe present the results utilizing state representations in Table 3. Detailed information regarding\\nindividual state representations for the tasks can be found in Appendix A. Through an analysis of\\nthe performance and diversity across all methods, we outline our key findings below.\\nMultiple Strategies for Multi-Modal Behavior Learning. This section discusses various strate-\\ngies employed by different models for learning multi-modal behavior. Deterministic models like\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT have limitations in this regard since they can only generate a single solution\\ngiven an initial state s0. On the other hand, VAE-based models like VAE-State and VAE-ACT are\\ncapable of generating different behaviors, but they tend to exhibit low behavior entropy, presumably\\ndue to a phenomenon often referred to as \\u201dmode collapse\\u201d (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In contrast,\\nIBC, BeT, and diffusion-based models demonstrate the capacity to learn multi-modal distributions.\\nIBC, for instance, exhibits high diversity in tasks like Avoiding, Pushing, and Sorting-2, with en-\\ntropy levels slightly superior to DDPM-MLP. BeT is capable of learning diverse solutions for each\\ntask, but it comes with a significant performance drop when compared to the deterministic BC-GPT\\nbaseline. Notably, diffusion-based methods, especially those incorporating transformer backbones,\\nexcel in learning diverse behavior while maintaining strong performance across all tasks. To of-\\nfer additional insights, we include visual representations of the diverse solutions generated by each\\nmethod for the Avoiding task in Figure 10. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of hyper-\\nparameter sensitivity, which is discussed in Section B. This analysis provides a deeper understanding\\n6\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTable 3: Comparison between various Imitation Learning algorithms, some of which incorporate his-\\ntory (\\u2021), action chunking (\\u2020), or both using state representations (State Data) and image observations\\n(Visual Data). We present the mean and standard deviation across six random seeds, highlighting\\nthe best performance for both history-based and non-history-based models using bold formatting.\\nSuccess

Notably, our findings reveal\\nthat increasing the number of diffusion steps leads to a substantial enhancement in diversity while\\nmaintaining consistent task performance.\\nHistorical Inputs and Prediction Horizons are Important. A comparison of results between\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT, VAE-State and VAE-ACT, BeT-MLP and BeT, DDPM-MLP and DDPM-\\nGPT reveals a notable trend: transformer-based methods consistently outperform their MLP-based\\ncounterparts. In particular, DDPM-GPT achieves an average 21% improvement in success rate\\nacross Avoiding, Aligning, and Pushing tasks compared to DDPM-MLP. While DDPM-MLP ex-\\nhibits higher entropy on the Aligning task, it lags behind on other tasks. When comparing VAE-\\nMLP to VAE-ACT, VAE-ACT demonstrates a success rate improvement of over 30% on most tasks,\\nindicating its effectiveness in capturing diverse behaviors. More significantly, transformers that\\nincorporate historical inputs or prediction horizons demonstrate the ability to tackle challenging\\ntasks like Sorting-4 and Stacking. However, the combination of historical information with ex-\\ntended prediction horizons (DDPM-ACT) does not appear to provide substantial benefits compared\\nto DDPM-GPT, which does not predict future actions.\\nScaling to More Complex Tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods excel in tasks such as Avoid-\\ning, Aligning, and Pushing; however, a notable performance gap emerges in Sorting and Stacking\\ntasks. In the case of Sorting, scaling with an increasing number of objects proves challenging for\\nall methods. Specifically, on the Sorting-6 task, none of the existing methods achieve satisfactory\\nperformance. The complexity of the observation space and task diversity significantly increases as\\nwe aggregate all box features into a single state vector. Consequently, there is a demand for models\\ncapable of learning compact and resilient state representations.\\n4.4\\nBENCHMARK USING IMAGE OBSERVATIONS\\nWe present the results utilizing image observations in Table 3. Detailed information regarding cam-\\nera setup can be found in Appendix A. Through an analysis of the performance and diversity across\\nall methods, we outline our key findings below.\\nComparison between State-Based and Image-Based Policies. State representations have proven\\nhighly effective for tasks demanding precise control (i.e. Aligning), but they do not scale with the\\nnumber of objects (i.e. Sorting). In such case, state-based approaches may struggle to exploit in-\\nvariances, which are essential for handling complex scenarios. Conversely, image representations\\nexhibit a notable capacity to handle scenarios involving multiple objects. However, image-based\\npolicy performs much worse than state-based policy on the Aligning task, which require precise\\ncontrol. The inherent difficulty in extracting fine-grained details and spatial relationships from im-\\nages makes it challenging in achieving precise manipulation.\\nTrade-off in Sequential Information Across Visual Tasks.
