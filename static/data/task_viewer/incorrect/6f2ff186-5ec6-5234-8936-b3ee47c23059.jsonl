{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

This performance\\nis typically measured in terms of the number of errors [1], contextual understanding [7], versatility [8],\\nproblem-solving skills [5], etc. However, these tasks are often only measured as an examination\\nof explicitly stated concepts in model output. Implicit, expressive communication largely remains\\nunstudied. Given that much of human communication is implicit [9], expressivity may represent an\\nimportant aspect of creating \\u201chuman-like\\u201d output in models, improving output quality and user trust\\nin many applications [10].\\nIn order for LLMs to generate text to communicate in a natural way, it is critical that they convey\\nboth explicit information and implicit information. In this context, we define expressivity as the\\nimplicit communication of information [11]. For instance, in a conversation about a movie, explicit\\ninformation would be \\u201cI thought the movie went on far too long\\u201d while implicit information may\\nbe expressed as \\u201cI kept checking my watch during the movie.\\u201d The fact remains the same: the\\nspeaker thought the movie was too long, but the second statement requires a level of interpretation.\\nExpressivity may come through various metaphors, lexical choices, etc. in daily communication,\\nand may take the form of a different speech act entirely.

We then conducted experiments\\nfor tasks with varying degrees of expressivity\\u2014poetry generation and code generation\\u2014to analyze\\nhow expressive various LLMs are. We found that LLMs have wildly varying degrees of expressivity,\\nand that models tended to be less expressive while generating code than while generating poetry,\\nsuggesting that models perform worse in low-expressivity domains. We then tested if models were\\nable to maintain expressivity throughout the course of a simulated conversation, testing the expression\\nof emotions and professions.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nExpressivity Defined: Most methods that delve into expressivity of language models typically\\nfocus on emotions, as studied in affective computing devices [15]. This includes recognizing\\nemotions from language or facial expressions and body language [16] or communicating emotion and\\npersonality [17, 18] in social robotics. However, this limited focus of emotions on expressivity does\\nnot capture other aspects of communication. Our study focuses on diverse aspects of expressivity,\\nranging from emotions to computer programming paradigms. We adapt a definition from linguistics,\\nto term \\u201cexpressivity\\u201d as the state of communicating information implicitly: showing, not telling [19].\\nTo further clarify, Yus offers a framework for distinguishing implicit and explicit communication:\\nimplicit information must be derived by the interlocutor, using contextual or pragmatic information\\n[20]. This is in contrast to explicit communication, which is represented immediately in the semantics\\nof text. For instance, the words \\u201ccheap\\u201d and \\u201caffordable\\u201d may have the same literal meaning, but\\n\\u201ccheap\\u201d may have a more negative connotation. The word \\u201cgreetings\\u201d might communicate a more\\nformal context than \\u201chello.\\u201d However, these meanings must be interpreted by the listener or reader in\\ncontext to be understood. Given that LLMs may struggle with contextual understanding, studying\\nexpressivity provides a lens to explore the limitations of language models [21].\\nEvaluating Large Language Models: Existing benchmarks for LLMs measure their capabilities in\\na variety of tasks such as mathematics [22], logical reasoning [23], and education [24]. In general,\\nbenchmarks take one of two forms: 1) automatically evaluated models by having an external LLM\\n[25] or ensemble of LLMs [26] to act as an evaluator or 2) use human feedback to manually evaluate\\nthe model. A notable example of the latter is Chatbot Arena [27], where public comparisons of\\ndifferent LLMs form a leaderboard. The former, automated evaluation, is has gained tremendous\\npopularity due to its speed, depth of knowledge, and scalability [28]. Recently, automated evaluation\\n- or more accurately AI feedback [29, 30] - has been proposed to solve the scalability issues of\\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) [31]. To the best of our knowledge, previous\\nstudies on evaluation of LLMs have not focused on expressivity.\\n3\\nExpressivity Arena\\nExpressivityArena is a Python-based framework that allows for simple, scalable, and flexible testing\\nof LLM expressivity.

The user prompt must\\ncontain two critical instructions: a domain, d, and an expressive signal, s. The domain d is simply\\na string naming the context in which the text must be written. An example might be a \\u201csong\\u201d or a\\n\\u201crecipe.\\u201d In order to test a given signal against alternatives, the user then defines a signal category.\\nThe signal category, SC, is a set which contains various expressive signals that each will be tested.\\nThe elements of the signal category set, s \\u2208SC, should belong to the same qualitative category, for\\ninstance a set of emotions, or a set of genres. For each signal s, the language model will be prompted\\nto generate a piece of text in the domain d expressing the signal s. A complete prompt takes the form\\nof: \\u201cPlease write a \\u2329d\\u232awhich conveys \\u2329s\\u232a. Do not explicitly mention \\u2329s\\u232ain your response.\\u201d\\nWe iterate this prompt for all s \\u2208SC.

To avoid unintentionally\\nleaking s in the response, if xout, contains an explicit mention of the signal s, the response will be\\nregenerated. Once the response has been generated, it is then given to a blind grader, another LLM,\\nfgrader(xout), that is unaware of the original prompt. The grader is then asked to guess, out of a set\\nof all possible signals used in the experiment, which one was meant to be expressed in the text. We\\ndefine the expressivity rate as the rate of correct guesses in a series.\\nOf course, the grader is central to this process, but should not itself be evaluated.

LLMs have been successful in evaluating other LLMs for other\\ntasks [31, 8, 4], so we expect them to be similarly successful when evaluating expressivity.

Certain emotions were frequently confused; these\\nwere typically emotions with similar semantics. However, all GPT models most often expressed\\napproval when prompted to express disapproval. This was a significant instance where two emotions\\nof conflicting meaning were frequently confused.\\nTable 2: Average expressivity rates (\\u2191) for each\\nmodel and task in experiment 2.\\nPython programs\\nPoetry\\nSkill\\nLevels\\nParadigms\\nPoets\\nEmotions\\nGPT-3.5\\n0.36\\n0.53\\n0.55\\n0.62\\nGPT-4\\n0.54\\n0.63\\n0.70\\n0.64\\nGPT-4o\\n0.46\\n0.83\\n0.68\\n0.61\\nLlama2\\n0.41\\n0.50\\n0.62\\n0.70\\nLlama3\\n0.47\\n0.63\\n0.70\\n0.66\\nGemma\\n0.31\\n0.50\\n0.53\\n0.59\\nFor the poets\\u2019 styles category, we used a set of\\n34 historically notable poets as a set of signals.\\nThe full list may be found in the Appendix D.2.1.\\nAgain, 30 different poems were generated by\\neach model for each poet as a signal.
