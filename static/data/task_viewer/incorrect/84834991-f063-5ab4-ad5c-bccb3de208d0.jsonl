{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We consider a series of input vectors xt \\u2208RD given at a certain time\\nstep t \\u2208{1, . . . , T}. X = X1:T = (x1, x2, . . . , xT ) \\u2208RD\\u00d7T denotes the matrix of stacked input\\nvectors from all time steps. Both sLSTM and mLSTM are recurrent neural networks, which either\\nmap a state (ht\\u22121, ct\\u22121, nt\\u22121) to a successor state (ht, ct, nt) given an input xt\\u22121 (sLSTM) or\\na state (ht\\u22121, Ct\\u22121, nt\\u22121) to a successor state (ht, Ct, nt) given an input xt\\u22121 (mLSTM). Here,\\nht \\u2208Rd denotes a hidden state, ct \\u2208Rd and Ct \\u2208Rd\\u00d7d denote cell states responsible for long-term\\nmemory and, nt \\u2208Rd denotes a normalizer state. sLSTM and mLSTM utilize several adjustable\\nweight matrices and bias vectors (detailed equations below) and employ input-, output-, and forget-\\ngates, activated by exponential (exp) or the sigmoid functions (\\u03c3). For cell inputs in sLSTM, the\\nhyperbolic tangent function (tanh, abbreviated as \\u03c6) is used as an activation function.\\n2.1\\nBlock Structures\\nThe sLSTM and mLSTM layers are integrated into larger residual backbones (Srivastava et al., 2015;\\nHe et al., 2016), which incorporate layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), pre- or post-up projection\\nlayers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dao, 2024), with short causal convolutions and group normalization\\n(Wu and He, 2020). Figure A1 depicts sLSTM and mLSTM blocks, as well as, a bidirectional\\nmLSTM configuration with weight-tied blocks. For more details, refer to (Beck et al., 2024, Sec.2.4).\\nFor Bio-xLSTM we retain these basic building blocks but adjust them to the respective domains.\\nThe entire architecture, including all layers, normalization, blocks, and other components, defines\\na mapping from an input sequence of length t to an output sequence. This mapping is denoted\\nas xLSTM : RD\\u00d7t 7\\u2192RD\\u00d7t, where xLSTM transforms the stacked inputs up to time step t, i.e.,\\nX1:t := (x1, x2, . . . , xt) \\u2208RD\\u00d7t, to the corresponding stacked outputs of sequence length t, i.e.,\\nY1:t := (y1, y2, . . . , yt) \\u2208RD\\u00d7t 1. The i-th sequence element is denoted with the subscript i, e.g.\\nthe i-th element from X1:t would be (X1:t)i. Similarly to the mapping xLSTM, we also define\\nmappings for the sequence-wise input-\\/output behaviour of layers themselves for an sLSTM layer\\n(sLSTM : RD\\u00d7t 7\\u2192RD\\u00d7t) or an mLSTM layer (mLSTM : RD\\u00d7t 7\\u2192RD\\u00d7t). If the specific\\nparameters used for the mapping are unclear, we will denote this by including a second argument in\\nthe function, separated by a semicolon. For details on the block structures, see Appendix Section B.3.\\n2.2\\nModes of Operation: Parallel, Chunkwise, and Recurrent\\nThe recurrent forms of sLSTM and mLSTM, introduced in Sections B.1 and B.2, provide efficient,\\nconstant-memory decoding during inference. This eliminates the need for expensive key-value\\ncaching, which represents a major challenge for Transformer models in long-range settings. Like\\nTransformers, mLSTM allows for parallelization across the sequence length which significantly\\nspeeds up training. Additionally, similar to linear attention variants (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Yang\\net al., 2024), mLSTM supports chunkwise parallel processing, blending recurrent and parallel modes\\n1Here xi and yi represent the inputs to and outputs from a particular model from an instance of an xLSTM\\narchitecture, rather than the inputs and outputs of a specific sLSTM or mLSTM layer\\n3\\n(Beck et al., 2025). This approach is especially advantageous for long-sequence training and prompt\\nencoding.

Human behavior may not align perfectly with optimizing the rational self-play\\nobjectives for several reasons, such as the skill difference between humans and autonomous agents\\n(e.g. bounded rationality, reaction speed), and, cognitive bias (e.g. hyperbolic time discounting,\\npreference for specific sub-tasks).\\nWe want our agent to collaborate effectively with humans, so we train our agent to respond optimally\\nto the behaviors that humans are likely to adopt, \\u03c0BR(H) \\u2208B(\\u03a0H\\u2217).

Understanding human cognition as optimal and\\ngeneral under limitations of time, computation and communication ([6]), might help us formalize and\\nintroduce these patterns of human behavior as inductive biases in AI systems that need to coordinate\\nwith humans. Towards this goal, we take into account two human limitations: (1) limitation on human\\nreaction speed to situational changes, and, (2) preference for immediate over future rewards [1].\\nAvailability of Data. Human behavior data can help train agents that successfully coordinate with\\nhumans, as shown by [4]. However, collecting this task-specific data for every scenario that AI agents\\nwill interact with humans is impractical, and human behavior can evolve over time, or, vary when\\ninteracting with AI versus other humans. We aim to identify task-invariant properties of human\\nbehavior applicable across domains.

Here, N = {1, 2} is the set of agents, S is the set of joint states, A = {A1, A2}\\nis the set of actions for each agent, r : S \\u00d7A \\u2192R is the common reward function\\u201e T : S \\u00d7A\\u00d7S \\u2192\\n[0, 1] is the transition function, and \\u03b3 \\u2208[0, 1] is the discount factor. At each timestep t, agent i\\nreceives the state st, and samples an action, ai,t \\u223c\\u03c0i(s), according to a policy \\u03c0i : S 7\\u2192Ai. We\\ndefine the expected return for a joint policy as J(\\u03c01, \\u03c02) = EM\\nat\\u223c(\\u03c01,\\u03c02)[PT\\nt=0 r(st, at)], where at is\\na joint action, and, an episode goes from time 0 to T.\\nAd-hoc teamwork. The goal of ad-hoc teamwork is \\u201cto create an autonomous agent that is able to\\nefficiently and robustly collaborate with previously unknown teammates on tasks to which they are all\\ncapable of contributing as team members\\u201d [18]. We can write this as, arg max\\u03c0 E\\u03c0\\u2032\\u223c\\u03a0capJ(\\u03c0, \\u03c0\\u2032),\\nwhere \\u03a0cap is the set of policies of capable team members.\\nSelf-Play (SP). In self-play, the objective is to maximize the expected return by finding the optimal\\njoint policy, \\u20d7\\n\\u03c0\\u2217\\u2208arg max(\\u03c01,\\u03c02) J(\\u03c01, \\u03c02). This solution is a Pareto-optimal equilibrium because if\\neither agent can improve the return by selecting a different policy then it will contradict the arg max.\\nHowever, it fails as a solution for ad-hoc teamwork because it assumes both agents follow the same\\nequilibrium, or compatible policies, which is not guaranteed even if both agents were trained by SP.\\nBest-Response (BR). In best-response, the objective is to maximize the expected return in response\\nto a fixed policy of the other agent. We consider a policy \\u03c0B, to be BR to \\u03c0, if J(\\u03c0B, \\u03c0) \\u2265\\nJ(\\u03c0\\u2032, \\u03c0)\\u2200\\u03c0\\u2032 \\u2208\\u03a0. We define the BR function, B, such that \\u03c0B \\u2208B(\\u03c0). Similarly, we define BR over\\na policy set, \\u03a0K = {\\u03c01, . . . , \\u03c0K} as,\\nB(\\u03a0K) \\u2208arg max\\n\\u03c0BR\\nE\\u03c0\\u2032\\u223cU(\\u03a0K) [J(\\u03c0BR, \\u03c0\\u2032)] ,\\n(1)\\nwhere U is the uniform distribution.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"BACKGROUND\\nQ-learning:\\nQ-learning methods (Gaskett et al. (1999); Watkins & Dayan (1992); van Hasselt\\net al. (2016); Kalashnikov et al. (2018); He et al. (2023b); Huang et al. (2023)), that are prominent\\nexamples of the off-policy RL algorithms, can be thought of as instantiations of the implicit policies\\ntechniques. The Q-function can be interpreted as the negated energy and it has a very special\\nsemantics: Q(s, a) stands for the total reward obtained by an agent applying action a in state s and\\nthen following optimal policy. Consequently, the training of the (neural network) approximation b\\nQ of\\nQ leverages the fact that Q is a fixed point of the so-called Bellman operator (Bellman (1954); Song\\net al. (2019)). Furthermore, learning the Q-function is an off-policy process and the argmin-defined\\npolicy is applied only after Q-learning is completed. The setting considered in this paper is more\\ngeneral - the energy E lacks the semantics of the negated Q-function which enables us to bypass the\\nseparate off-policy training of E. The algorithms presented in this paper are in fact on-policy.\\nEnergy-based Models:\\nImplicit policies can be viewed as special instantiations of energy-based\\nmodels (EBMs) (see: LeCun et al. (2006); Song & Kingma (2021) for a comprehensive introduction to\\nEBMs). Several impactful ML architectures have been recently reinterpreted as EBMs. Those include\\nTransformers Vaswani et al. (2017) with their attention modules resembling modern associative\\nmemory units (the latter being flagship examples of EBMs Ramsauer et al. (2021) implementing\\ndifferentiable dictionaries via exponential energies). We mention Transformers here on purpose.\\nIn ITTs the energy is the dot product of latent action and negated latent state. Thus, ITTs can\\nbe interpreted as learning the cross-attention between the state and action-spaces with actions\\ncorresponding to keys and states to queries.\\n\\u2026\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\naction-tower\\nstate-tower\\n\\u2026\\n\\u2026\\nK\\n,\\nFigure 1: The conceptual description of the Implicit Two-Tower (ITT) stack.

The modern attention mechanism used by these models Vaswani et al.

An important\\nabstraction we use in our work relies on rewriting these matrices as the products QK (Query*Key)\\nand OV (Output*Value)2.

This is a useful property as we are motivated by looking for subspaces\\nthat are written into\\/read from by these matrices and this reduces the search space.\\nIn order to ground our findings about inter-layer communication to real model behaviors, we focus\\non attention head interactions which we already understand and work backwards to determine how\\nthey communicate. Recent works in circuit analysis provide detailed explanations of how different\\nmodel components interact on controlled datasets. In particular, we make use of the Indirect Object\\nIdentification (IOI) circuit discovered in Wang et al. [2022]. We use GPT2-Small, to study three\\nspecific types of interactions between heads: cases where heads write information that is used by the\\nkeys, queries, or values of later heads.\\nWhen we refer to an attention head as 3.0 or 7.9, this means layer 3, head 0 or layer 7 head 9.\\nThree Types of Composition\\nIn attention heads, there are three ways that earlier heads can\\ncontribute to the processing done downstream. In all cases, information is written into the residual\\nstream by the OV matrix of an earlier head, and read back out by either the Query, Key, or Value\\nmatrices of a later head. These concepts are introduced in Elhage et al. [2021]. We also provide an\\nexample of each composition type that we examine further in Section 3. We look for communication\\nchannels in one of each type of composition. These are previous token to induction head composition\\n(key) [Olsson et al., 2022, Singh et al., 2024, Reddy, 2023], duplicate token to inhibition head\\ncomposition (value), and inhibition to mover head composition (query) [Wang et al., 2022]. The\\nvariation in the way these heads communicate only changes how we calculate the composition score\\n[Elhage et al., 2021] and individual implementation of the communication, but we do not make claims\\nabout how these types of composition differ from each other in more meaningful ways.\\nThe Inhibition-Mover Subcircuit\\nWe build on work from IOI [Wang et al., 2022] which documents\\na circuit that appears in multiple tasks [Merullo et al., 2024]. This circuit includes mover heads, which\\ncopy tokens from context to the output, and inhibition heads which (optionally) block the mover\\nheads\\u2019 attention to certain tokens and thus prevent certain tokens from being copied. Inhibition heads\\nare known to receive signals from duplicate token head value vectors which help inform which tokens\\nto inhibit. In GPT2-Small, the known inhibition heads are 7.3, 7.9, 8,6, and 8.10 and we consider\\ntheir communication to the mover head 9.93. This is the example we use for query composition\\nexperiments. In Section 5 we explore this circuit\\u2019s role in problems of prompt sensitivity and a\\nlearned structure to control the indexing of tokens in the context window.\\n3for simplicity we only consider this mover head, but we do not find the choice matters much.\\n3\\n0.65\\n0.7\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n0.04\\n0.06\\n0.08\\n0.1\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nAvg.
