{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We implement KnowGPT upon GPT-\\n3.5. Our experiments are designed to answer the following research questions:\\n\\u2022 RQ1 (Main results): How does KnowGPT perform when compared with the state-of-the-art LLMs\\nand KG-enhanced QA baselines?\\n\\u2022 RQ2 (Ablation Study): How does each key component of KnowGPT contribute to the performance?\\n\\u2022 RQ3 (Case study): How could KG help solve complex reasoning tasks? See Appendix 4.4.\\n4.1\\nExperimental Setup\\nDatasets. We evaluate KnowGPT on three QA datasets spanning two fields: CommonsenseQA [66] and\\nOpenBookQA [52] serve as benchmarks for commonsense reasoning, while MedQA-USMLE [34]\\nacts as a domain-specific QA benchmark. The statistics of these three datasets can be found in Table 5\\nin the Appendix.\\nBaselines. We carefully select baseline models from four categories for a comprehensive evaluation.\\nLM + Fine-tuning. We compare our method with vanilla fine-tuned LMs. Specifically, we choose\\nBert-base, Bert-large [35], and RoBerta-large [49] as representative fine-tune LM methods. To\\nconduct commonsense and biomedical QA, we fine-tune these three LMs via additional linear layers.\\nKG-enhanced LM. We have also implemented several recently released models for integrating KGs\\ninto question answering, which encompass MHGRN [20], QA-GNN [80], HamQA [15], JointLK [64],\\nGreaseLM [88] and GrapeQA [67]. To ensure a fair comparison, we implement these baselines with\\nadvanced language models that are optimized for particular datasets. Specifically, RoBerta-large [49]\\nis used for CommenseQA, while AristoRoBERTa [13] is designated for OpenBookQA. For MedQA,\\nwe opt for the top-tier biomedical language model, SapBERT [45]. Note that due to the white-box\\nnature of these methods and their high computation overheads, it is infeasible to apply them to\\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\\nLLM + Zero-shot. We include several representative generative LLMs, including ChatGLM, Chat-\\nGLM2, Baichuan-7B, InternLM, GPT-3, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as knowledge-agnostic alternatives.\\nSpecifically, we used the model \\u2018text-davinci-002\\u2019 provided by OpenAI as the implementation of GPT-\\n3, and \\u2018gpt-3.5-turbo\\u2019 and \\u2018gpt-4\\u2019 as the implementations of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively (we\\nhave provided more implementation details of all LLMs in Appendix A.4). The question-answering\\ntask is conducted under the zero-shot setting with the question query from the test set as input.\\nLLM + KG Prompting. To verify the effectiveness of our prompting strategy, we also add the\\nstate-of-the-art KG prompting methods, i.e., CoK [71], RoG [50], and Mindmap [74] as baselines.\\nNotably, we did include KGR [25] in our main results, since the authors have not released their codes.\\n4.2\\nMain Results (RQ1)\\nTo address RQ1, we evaluate KnowGPT by comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines on the three\\nbenchmark datasets. KnowGPT is based on the original GPT-3.5. We measure the performance using\\naccuracy, which calculates the percentage of questions correctly predicted by the model out of the\\ntotal questions in the test set. We have the following observations:\\n\\u2022 KnowGPT outperforms all categories of methods, including sixteen different baselines, across all\\ndatasets and model architectures. This suggests that KnowGPT can effectively inject the knowledge\\nfrom KGs to LLMs.\\n\\u2022 KnowGPT surpasses the performance of GPT-3.5 and even GPT-4. On average, KnowGPT achieves a\\n23.7% higher testing accuracy than GPT-3.5. Specifically, KnowGPT outperforms GPT-3.5 by 10.8%,\\n7\\nTable 1: Performance comparison among baseline models and KnowGPT on three benchmark datasets.\\nCatagory\\nModel\\nCommonsenseQA\\nOpenBookQA\\nMedQA\\nIHdev-Acc.

The\\nfull records on the leaderboard are shown on the website2, while our result can be found from here3.\\nWe summarize the related submissions in Table 2, including three categories: traditional KG-enhanced\\nLM, fine-tuning of LLMs, e.g., T5-11B used in UnifiedQA, and ensemble of multiple predictors.\\nKnowGPT significantly outperforms traditional KG-enhanced LMs with 5.2% improvements when\\ncompared to the best baseline. The third group of methods occupies the leaderboard by leverag-\\ning ensemble learning strategies. Nevertheless, KnowGPT can still obtain competitive performance\\nwithout ensembling with 0.6% above GenMC Ensemble [33]. Notably, our KnowGPT is remarkably\\ncomparable to the human performance.\\n2https:\\/\\/leaderboard.allenai.org\\/open_book_qa\\/submissions\\/public.\\n3https:\\/\\/leaderboard.allenai.org\\/open_book_qa\\/submission\\/cp743buq4uo7qe4e9750.\\n8\\nTable 2: OpenBookQA Official Leaderboard records of three groups of related models.\\nHuman Performance (0.917)\\nw\\/o KG\\n0.778\\nUnifiedQA [36]\\n0.872\\nMHGRN [20]\\n0.806\\nDRAGON [79]\\n0.878\\nQA-GNN [80]\\n0.828\\nGenMC [33]\\n0.898\\nGreaseLM [88]\\n0.848\\nHuman Performance\\n0.917\\nHamQA [15]\\n0.850\\nGenMC Ensemble [33]\\n0.920\\nJointLK [64]\\n0.856\\nX-Reasoner [32]\\n0.952\\nGSC [72]\\n0.874\\nKnowGPT\\n0.926\\n4.3\\nAblation Studies (RQ2)\\nTo answer RQ2, we conduct two ablation studies. First, in Table 3, we measure the importance of\\nthe tailored reinforcement learning-based knowledge extraction module, i.e., PRL. Specifically, we\\ncompare it with the heuristic sub-graph extraction strategy, i.e., Psub. The performance is evaluated by\\ndirectly feeding the extracted knowledge with the prompt format of \\u2018Sentence\\u2019, i.e., Fs, to GPT-3.5.\\nWe also include \\u2018w\\/o KG\\u2019 as the baseline where GPT-3.5 is asked to independently answer the given\\nquestion with no reasoning background provided. The results clearly indicate the vital role of our\\nproposed knowledge extraction strategies. Second, we compare each of the three prompt formats\\nsubject to the same extracted knowledge. The detailed results are shown in Table 4. Though different\\nformats perform similarly within the difference of 2.2% - 3.3%, they are particularly suitable for\\ndifferent kinds of questions. We illustrate this observation in the following case study section. Both\\nablation studies support the indispensability of each module, armed with a tailored deep reinforcement\\nlearning-based knowledge extraction and a context-aware prompt translation, our KnowGPT performs\\nbest on all three benchmark datasets.\\nTable 3: Ablation study on the effectiveness\\nof two knowledge extraction methods.\\nKnowledge Extraction\\nModel\\nCSQA\\nOBQA\\nMedQA\\nIHdev\\nIHtest\\nTest\\nTest\\nw\\/o KG\\nGPT-3\\n0.539\\n0.520\\n0.482\\n0.289\\nGPT-3.5\\n0.735\\n0.710\\n0.598\\n0.487\\nGPT-4\\n0.776\\n0.786\\n0.910\\n0.763\\nPsub\\nGPT-3.5\\n0.750\\n0.739\\n0.865\\n0.695\\nPRL\\nGPT-3.5\\n0.815\\n0.800\\n0.889\\n0.755\\nOurs\\nKnowGPT\\n0.827\\n0.818\\n0.924\\n0.781\\nTable 4: Ablation study on different prompt\\nformats for the extracted knowledge.\\nKnowledge Extraction\\nPrompts\\nCSQA\\nOBQA\\nMedQA\\nIHdev\\nIHtest\\nTest\\nTest\\nPsub\\nFt\\n0.728\\n0.701\\n0.832\\n0.589\\nFs\\n0.750\\n0.739\\n0.865\\n0.695\\nFg\\n0.737\\n0.715\\n0.871\\n0.680\\nPRL\\nFt\\n0.782\\n0.769\\n0.853\\n0.739\\nFs\\n0.815\\n0.800\\n0.889\\n0.755\\nFg\\n0.806\\n0.793\\n0.906\\n0.762\\nFull KnowGPT\\n0.827\\n0.818\\n0.924\\n0.781\\n4.4\\nCase Studies (RQ3)\\nFor RQ3, we provide insights into how KnowGPT facilitates the prompt translation with a real case\\nfrom CommonsenseQA. We visualize both the extracted knowledge and the textual inputs to GPT-3.5\\nin Figure 3. In this example, given the same extracted knowledge, GPT-3.5 answers correctly based\\non the sentence format that we provide. In contrast, it fails to answer the question with triples and\\ngraph descriptions. They clearly indicate the superiority of KnowGPT in an automatic context-aware\\nprompt translation. We make the following observations: (i) Triple format Ft is intuitively suitable\\nfor all the simple questions by directly indicating the one-hop knowledge. (ii) Graph description may\\ninevitably introduce noise to ensure the completeness and contextual fluency of the directed graph.\\nIn this example, since \\u2018vacation\\u2019 appears in both question and answer choices, over-emphasizing\\nand connecting the knowledge about \\u2018vacation\\u2019 with other concepts in the graph misleads the model\\nto make a prediction with an oblique focus. (iii) Our KnowGPT has shown superior performance in\\nautomatically constructing suitable prompts for particular questions.\\n5\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
