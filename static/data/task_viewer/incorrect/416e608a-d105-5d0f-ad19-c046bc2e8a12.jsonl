{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Abstract\",\"section_content\":\"Aligned language models face a signifcant limitation as their fne-tuning often results in compromised safety. To tackle this, we propose a simple method RESTA that performs LLM safety realignment. RESTA stands for REstoring Safety through Task Arithmetic. At its core, it involves a simple arithmetic addition of a safety vector to the weights of the compromised model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RESTA in both parameter-effcient and full fne-tuning, covering a wide range of downstream tasks, including instruction following in Chinese, English, and Hindi, as well as problem-solving capabilities in Code and Math. We also showcase the generalizability of RESTA on three existing safety evaluation benchmarks and a multilingual benchmark dataset proposed as a part of this work, consisting of 550 harmful questions covering 11 categories, each with 5 sub-categories of harm. Overall, RESTA decreases the harmfulness of the compromised model from $18.6\\\\%$ to $5.1\\\\%$ and from $9.2\\\\%$ to $1.5\\\\%$ in parameter-effcient and full fnetuning, respectively, while maintaining most of the model\\u2019s performance on the task. We release the source code at: https:\\/\\/github. com\\/declare-lab\\/resta.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"The popularity of language models has recently experienced an unprecedented surge, not only excelling in logic-intensive tasks such as code generation (Roziere et al., 2023) but also demonstrating the ability to assist in a wide range of unseen tasks to be inferred on the fy (Wang et al., 2022), i.e., stronger abilities to follow instructions.\\nWhile fne-tuning pushes LLMs to be more performant on a specifc domain (Cui et al., 2023), it comes at the cost of a huge compromise on their safety, even if one does not intend to do so. With the help of a crafted harmful questionanswering dataset of just 100 samples, Bhardwaj and Poria (2023a); Yang et al. (2023) shows ChatGPT becomes unsafe by simply using their fnetuning API. Qi et al. (2023) further shows that safety compromise happens even with benign and commonly used datasets. In this work, we introduce RESTA (REstoring Safety through Task Arithmetic), which adds the safety guardrails back to the model.\\n\\nRESTA is simple, fast, and effective approach that provides a no-cost solution to the model realignment. This is primarily due to the core operation it performs, i.e., element-wise addition of safety vector to the model parameters. To further enhance the impact of safety vectors, we employ Drop and REscale (DARE) for removing redundant delta parameters obtained in fne-tuning task (Yu et al., 2023).\\nWe test RESTA on two common LLM fnetuning approaches, i.e., Parameter-Effcient FineTuning (PEFT) and Full Fine-Tuning (Full-FT) both of which we observe to compromise the model\\u2019s safety (Figure 3) on a wide range of benign datasets including language-specifc Alpaca such as Chinese, Hindi, English, and logicintensive tasks such as Code and Math. For fnegrained safety evaluation of models, we introduce a new safety evaluation benchmark CATQA that covers questions across prohibited use cases mentioned in OpenaAI and Meta\\u2019s usage policies (Table 2). CATQA is a set of 11 categories depicting prohibited cases. Each category is further divided into 5 sub-categories. For each sub-category, we collect 10 harmful questions, making CATQA a set of 550 harmful questions. To test the generalizability of RESTA beyond English, we make CATQA multilingual, extending it to Chinese and Vietnamese.\\n\\nOur evaluations of fne-tuned Llama-2 on CATQA show a sharp drop in unsafety score from $33.57\\\\%$ to $12.17\\\\%$ in PEFT and from $22.16\\\\%$ to $4.34\\\\%$ in Full-FT averaged across fne-tuning domains. To gauge the effect of the safety vector beyond categories in CATQA, we evaluate RESTA on three existing safety evaluation benchmarks\\u2014 HARMFULQA (Bhardwaj and Poria, 2023a), ADVERSARIALQA (Zou et al., 2023), DANGEROUSQA (Shaikh et al., 2022). We observe a reduction in the unsafety score from $18.59\\\\%$ to $5.14\\\\%$ in PEFT and from $9.16\\\\%$ to $1.55\\\\%$ in FullFT when averaged across benchmark datasets and fne-tuning domains. The effectiveness of RESTA is evident across languages, as seen in the $26.2\\\\%$ reduction in PEFT and $21.37\\\\%$ reduction in FullFT on the Vietnamese CATQA. Similar improvements are observed for CATQA in Chinese, with a reduction of $17.35\\\\%$ in PEFT and $24.54\\\\%$ in FullFT. We depict the enhanced safety in Figure 1.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"7 Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"We proposed RESTA that adds a safety vector to a fne-tuned model, aiming to compensate for the compromised safety. DARE, which drops and rescales delta weights, is observed to further help RESTA to be more effective at safety realignment. To test the model\\u2019s safety, we also proposed a new safety evaluation benchmark CATQA in three languages, i.e., English, Vietnamese, and Chinese consisting of 550 questions covering 11 categories of prohibitive usage released by OpenAI and Meta. Our evaluations on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks show that RESTA signifcantly reduces the harmfulness of the fnetuned models from $17.86\\\\%$ to $4.57\\\\%$ with minimal performance degradation. The safety vector is also observed to generalize beyond the categories it was trained on and across the languages as shown by our evaluations on existing three safety benchmark datasets and multilingual version of CATQA.\"}\n\nIn total, 3 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
