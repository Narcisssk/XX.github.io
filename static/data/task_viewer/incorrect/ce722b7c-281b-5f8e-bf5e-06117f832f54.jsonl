{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

FiNER identifed an issue with over-fragmentation of numerals by the BERT tokenizer, which negatively impacts the performance of subword-based models. To overcome this problem, FiNER introduced two pseudotokens: [NUM], representing an entire numeral token, and [SHAPE], representing the shape of a numeral (e.g., 54.3 would be replaced by [XX.X]).

In particular, we benchmark using AttentionXML which focuses on the entire input and not a particular span; we use a two-step approach to identify and label numerals in a sentence. The frst step is to identify the relevant numerals in a sentence and the second step is to label the numerals with their corresponding label. We describe the two steps in detail below.\\nBinary Classifer: We use a BERT-based sequence tagger to identify the relevant numerals in a sentence. This tagger marks each numeral of a sentence with a label indicating whether it is a relevant numeral or not.\\nAttentionXML Model: It is a deep learning approach for multi-label text classifcation, consisting of fve layers: a word representation layer, a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer, a multi-label attention layer, a fully connected layer, and an output layer. GloVe word embeddings of tokenized text is fed as input to the the BiLSTM layer. The output is then passed through a multilabel attention mechanism introduced in You et al. (2019), which allows to capture the important parts of texts most relevant to each label. The model also includes one or two fully connected layers and an output layer, with shared parameters across all labels to reduce the risk of overftting and keep the model scale small. The binary cross-entropy loss function is used to train the model.\\n\\nWhile FiNER uses masking strategies to mask all numerals in a sentence, here we only mask the irrelevant numerals to psuedo-focus on the relevant numeral span.

In this paper, we formulate the task of automating the assignment of a label to a particular numeral span in a sentence from an extremely large label set. Towards this task, we release a dataset, Financial Numeric Extreme Labelling (FNXL), annotated with 2,794 labels. We benchmark the performance of the FNXL dataset by formulating the task as (a) a sequence labelling problem and (b) a pipeline with span extraction followed by Extreme Classifcation.

These metrics are used to tag portions of SEC documents including, numerals using eXtensive Business Reporting Language (XBRL), an XML based language to facilitate the processing of fnancial information. The process of annotating the documents requires enormous manual effort: expert annotators from a company have to go through the document and mark each relevant detail with a relevant GAAP metric label. This necessitates the development of an automatic annotation process that may reduce the manual effort to annotate the documents. Solving this task would also help with annotation of old as well as new reports (which may not contain XBRL tags). Towards this goal, we aim to decrease\\nThis problem has previously been tackled by FiNER (Loukas et al., 2022), as a sequence labelling approach using BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), where their set of labels is the 139 labels that occur the most frequently. However, we fnd that in the real-world setting, a much larger number of labels are used to annotate the text found in these documents. Thus, to evaluate the real world context, we painstakingly prepare a dataset, FNXL that contains a total of 2,794 tags. We realize that given the sheer number of labels, extreme classifcation is an ideal methodology that can be followed. Subsequently, we fnd that the AttentionXML method (You et al., 2019) from the Extreme Classifcation (XC) repository (Bhatia et al., 2016) can be modifed to suit our problem setting. Consequently, we use the dataset, FNXL to benchmark both the FiNER based sequence labelling approach and the AttentionXML method. We fnd that XC methods give a comparable performance (better in certain situations) as FiNER.

FiNER utilizes contextualized subword embeddings from fne-tuned BERT and a logistic regression layer to accurately classify named entities in text. FiNER identifed an issue with over-fragmentation of numerals by the BERT tokenizer, which negatively impacts the performance of subword-based models. To overcome this problem, FiNER introduced two pseudotokens: [NUM], representing an entire numeral token, and [SHAPE], representing the shape of a numeral (e.g., 54.3 would be replaced by [XX.X]). They also additionally release SEC-BERT based models which are BERT-BASE models pre-trained on the EDGAR-CORPUS (Loukas et al., 2021).\\n\\nWe showcase the results for six FiNER based models: three each of BERT-BASE and SECBASE, respectively.

Due to the similarity of our dataset with the XC datasets, we adapt an XC method to our use-case. In particular, we benchmark using AttentionXML which focuses on the entire input and not a particular span; we use a two-step approach to identify and label numerals in a sentence. The frst step is to identify the relevant numerals in a sentence and the second step is to label the numerals with their corresponding label. We describe the two steps in detail below.\\nBinary Classifer: We use a BERT-based sequence tagger to identify the relevant numerals in a sentence. This tagger marks each numeral of a sentence with a label indicating whether it is a relevant numeral or not.\\nAttentionXML Model: It is a deep learning approach for multi-label text classifcation, consisting of fve layers: a word representation layer, a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer, a multi-label attention layer, a fully connected layer, and an output layer. GloVe word embeddings of tokenized text is fed as input to the the BiLSTM layer. The output is then passed through a multilabel attention mechanism introduced in You et al. (2019), which allows to capture the important parts of texts most relevant to each label. The model also includes one or two fully connected layers and an output layer, with shared parameters across all labels to reduce the risk of overftting and keep the model scale small. The binary cross-entropy loss function is used to train the model.\\n\\nWhile FiNER uses masking strategies to mask all numerals in a sentence, here we only mask the irrelevant numerals to psuedo-focus on the relevant numeral span. A relevant numeral here means the numeral for which we want the model to assign a label. We experiment with different masking strategies such as [MASK], [NUM] and [SHAPE] and showcase an example in Figure 3.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
