{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Through multiple\\nexperiments, we have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach, and we believe this work will pave\\nway for future research towards building large-scale efficient neural architectures through proposed\\nscaling of smaller networks.\\n2\\nPublished as a Tiny Paper at ICLR 2024\\nto a pseudo-layer and the output is then projected back to the selected neurons via individual skip\\nconnections. More details on the generic idea are presented in Appendix A.\\nChoosing the right neurons is crucial for the efficient scaling of the network architectures. We\\nachieve this through the identification of neurons with the smallest negative eigenvalues derived from\\na Hessian approximation introduced by Wu et al. (2019). Existence of both positive and negative\\neigenvalues have been proved to contribute to the saddle points of the loss landscape (Alain et al.,\\n2019). This selection criterion tends to accelerates the shifting of negative eigenvalues towards zero\\nto escape saddle points, a phenomenon that naturally occurs during neural network training (Sagun\\net al., 2017).\\nFinally, ensuring function preservation during scaling is critical (Chen et al., 2015). Adding neurons\\nwithout modifying existing neuron weights and biases ensures that even intermediate functions are\\npreserved. To achieve such function preservation, we incorporate a strategy of adding two neurons\\nwith the same magnitude but opposite polarities for each selected neuron. This preserves the overall\\nfunction without altering the weights of the scaled neurons while handling complex network topolo-\\ngies, like skip connections successfully. The mathematical formulation is detailed in Appendix B.\\nIn summary, our neuron scaling method involves the selection of neurons with minimal neg-\\native eigenvalues, accommodating skip connections, and ensuring function preservation by\\nintroducing paired neurons with opposite polarities. This innovative approach contributes to the\\nscalability of transformers at a neuron level, paving the way for more effective and robust training\\nprocedures.\\n3\\nEXPERIMENTS\\nFor the experiments presented in this paper, we use ImageNet100 dataset, obtained through random\\nsampling of 100 classes from the Imagenet1K (Deng et al., 2009).

We tried reducing the width\\nof ATTN and FC layers at equal proportions and reducing the width of only ATTN or FC Layers.\\nTable 3 shows the result of the grid search.

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term. The detailed\\nresults are presented in Figure 9.\\nOur findings reveal that increasing the number of diffusion steps primarily enhances behavior en-\\ntropy, signifying an improvement in the model\\u2019s capacity to capture multi-modalities. However,\\nfor BeT and VAE-ACT, we did not observe a consistent trend indicating a correlation between the\\nparameters and success rate or entropy.\\nInference Time Comparison.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Methods\\n3.1\\nProblem Definition\\nIn the scientific domain, considering the causal factors x \\u2208X and the observed physical outcome\\ny \\u2208Y, there are two major problems to be solved: the forward simulation of X \\u2192Y, and the inverse\\ndesign of Y \\u2192X. The forward simulation is definite and can be obtained by solving the mathematical\\nequations involved inside the physical system. However, the inverse design is nontrivial because there\\nis no such equation that describes the inverse relationship. In addition, the one-to-many mapping\\nissue, meaning multiple different x can lead to similar y, also complicates this problem.\\nFor multilayer structures, the causal factors x refer to the multilayer structure and include the material\\ncomposition m = [m1, m2, . . . , mN] and layer thicknesses t = [t1, t2, . . . , tN], where N denotes\\nthe number of layers. Usually, material mi is a discrete variable, and ti is a continuous variable. On\\nthe other hand, y refers to the optical responses that we hope to design, e.g., spectrum or colors,\\nand can be represented as a vector. TMM [7] can finish the forward prediction and calculate the\\nspectrum y for a given x by solving equations relating to the wave fields at the boundaries of each\\nlayer. However, TMM does not inherently support the reverse computation of deriving x from a given\\ny. In OptoGPT, the model treats the design parameters of x = {[m1, m2, . . . , mN], [t1, t2, . . . , tN]}\\nas a sequence of x = {[m1, t1], [m2, t2], . . . , [mN, tN]} and uses sequential generation to design\\nmultilayer structures layer-by-layer when given input y as a condition. In their consideration, at\\neach layer, there are 18 different types of materials and 50 different thicknesses discretized by 10nm\\nranging from 10nm to 500nm. The maximum number of layers is 20. Therefore, the size of the\\n3\\nmultilayer structures design space extends to (18 \\u221750)20 \\u223c1059. For optical responses of y, they are\\nconsidering reflection and transmission spectrum among 400-1100nm with 10nm gap.\\nThe dataset generation in OptoGPT is a two-step random sampling process. They first randomly\\ngenerate 10M different structures by uniformly sampling the material and thickness at each layer,\\nthen use TMM to simulate and obtain their spectrum, making the dataset consist of (x, y) pairs of\\nstructures and spectrum. This synthetic dataset is then used to train OptoGPT to learn the inverse\\nmapping from desired spectral outcomes back to structural designs. As mentioned above, this would\\nlead to the issue of OOD and causes problems when designing for some practical applications. This\\nissue is non-trivial as we cannot add infinite data in the sampling process due to computational limit,\\nand many traditional methods in CV and NLP such as in-context learning [26] cannot be applied as we\\nhave no plausible assumptions on the distribution of our sampled region with the actual distribution\\nof the space.\\n3.2\\nSelf-Improving Data Augmentation\\nNeural networks have shown some limited extrapolation ability [27]. This, however, can be utilized\\nto provide a starting point when augmenting training data. Here is the intuition: we can gradually\\nexplore and extend the data space out of the original scope through perturbations guided by physical\\nsimulators and finally reach the OOD region. We illustrate this idea in Figure 2a. The green region\\nrefers to the space of y corresponding to the random sampling in the space of x. The red region is the\\nOOD region that is not sampled or under-sampled in the space of y. Notice that each point denotes a\\ndifferent optical response, namely, a different inverse design task. After training on the green region,\\nwe expect that the neural networks have some extrapolation ability to expand the identifiable region\\nto the blue region, which is the region that is slightly outside of the training dataset distribution.\\nFigure 2: Illustration of the self-improving data augmentation. (a) Visualization of the self-improving\\nin the space of optical responses y. (b) Diagram of our workflow: We input a synthetic OOD dataset\\nand ask the model to generate the structure design. Then using perturbation method, we further\\nexplore beyond the scope of the original model, and construct a small augmented dataset with better\\ndata representation of the OOD region to finetune the model.\\nTo reach the blue region, we query our model with some practical and difficult design targets that are\\noutside of the training dataset and ask our model to give designs, which will be used as a starting\\npoint to approach the red region. Next, we will perturb inside the structure space of x. To guarantee\\nthat we are approaching the red region in the response space of y, we use GA to perturb the materials\\nand PSO to perturb the thickness with the goal of minimizing the difference in the optical responses.\\nHowever, instead of running the complete optimization which requires thousands of iteration steps,\\nwe only run limited optimization steps (e.g., 5 iterations) to maintain small perturbation and fast speed.\\nAfter that, we use TMM to obtain the simulated optical responses for these perturbated structures\\nand calculate their spectrum MSE compared to the target spectrum. We only keep these structures\\nwith a lower spectrum MSE than the previous model and collect them to create a new dataset for\\nfinetuning. We can iterate this process several times to gradually push the model to approach the OOD\\nregion and achieve better performance. Figure 2b shows the complete pipeline of self-improving data\\naugmentation. We also provide a pseudo algorithm in Algorithm 1.\\n4\\nAlgorithm 1 Self-Improving Data Augmentation\\n1: Construct a dataset S with optical responses in the OOD region.\\n2: Query the OptoGPT model with S and generate a set of structures X using auto-regressive\\ndecoding method D, e.g., greedy decoding, Top-KP sampling [28, 29], or beam search.\\n3: Apply perturbation method GA_PSO on X to create multiple new samples \\u02c6\\nX.\\n4: Use TMM to evaluate the performance of \\u02c6\\nX and select those with improved performance to form\\na new augmented dataset X\\u2032.\\n5: Finetune OptoGPT on this augmented dataset X\\u2032.\\n6: Repeat step 2-5 until no significant improvement on model performance.\\n3.3\\nPerturbation Method\\nThe core of our method is the perturbation, which enables our model to effectively explore beyond\\nthe current scope and move to the desired OOD region. Therefore, the generated structures of X\\nshould be as diverse as possible, giving a wide range of distinct starting point so that we can better\\nexplore beyond the original scope. Fortunately, for GPT-type models, this can be easily achieved\\nusing probabilistic decoding methods such as top-k [28] or top-p sampling [29], where different\\nsampling seeds would lead to different outputs.\\nOnce we obtain initial structures from OptoGPT, the next step is to perturb these structures towards the\\nOOD region. Multilayer structures have two different sets of parameters: the material and thickness.\\nTherefore, we propose a two-step perturbation approach called GA_PSO to first perturb the material\\nusing GA, then perturb thickness using PSO. During each perturbation, the structures are optimized\\nand modified with the goal of decreasing the difference between simulated optical responses and\\ntarget responses. However, different from general optimization process which takes thousands or\\nmore iterations, we terminate the optimization process within few iterations of the workflow. This is\\nbecause we only want to introduce a small perturbation to the training dataset for a better learning.\\nIn addition, running more iterations on each individual sample from this generated structures can\\ntake a long time. Early termination in the optimization process can provide a good balance between\\nperformance and efficiency. We also provide a pseudo algorithm for GA_PSO in Algorithm 2.\\nAlgorithm 2 GA_PSO Perturbation Method\\n1: For each individual structure in the generated structure X, fix its thickness and apply the Genetic\\nAlgorithm (GA) to perturb the materials with the following strategies:\\n\\u2022 Mutation: Divide materials into five different types based on the refractive index: high,\\nmedium, and low refractive index dielectric material, metal, and semiconductor materials.\\nFor each layer, perform material mutations with probabilities: 70% within the same group,\\n20% switch to a different group, and 10% remain unchanged.\\n\\u2022 Crossover: Select two structures, and create a new structure by concatenating the first half\\nfrom the first structure and the second half from the second structure.\\n2: For each individual structure in the generated structure X after doing material perturbation, fix its\\nmaterial and apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on the thickness. Since we only conduct\\nseveral iterations for PSO, we save all these intermediate structures among the optimization\\ntrajectory for next step.\\nNotice here we perturb the material and thickness separately using different optimization methods.\\nThere are several considerations: (1) The space of the combination of material and thickness is huge,\\nand the perturbation method needs to achieve progress in a controllable time. Since genetic algorithm\\nis time-consuming, separating the thickness optimization for PSO will yield better efficiency. (2)\\nConducting material permutation requires integrating prior knowledge in material design, in which\\nhere we separate the materials in groups. This is only achievable by Genetic Algorithm in mutation\\nphase since it can deal with discrete variables.\\n5\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We compare our methods with the following three types of previous state-of-the-art methods:\\nDiscriminative methods.

The detailed\\nresults are presented in Figure 9.\\nOur findings reveal that increasing the number of diffusion steps primarily enhances behavior en-\\ntropy, signifying an improvement in the model\\u2019s capacity to capture multi-modalities. However,\\nfor BeT and VAE-ACT, we did not observe a consistent trend indicating a correlation between the\\nparameters and success rate or entropy.\\nInference Time Comparison. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of inference times for\\nall baseline models using both state- and image-based inputs.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities. MVP (transfer) trained with simple tasks (TASD and ASTE here) with adequate data can be easily transferred to tough tasks (ASQP and ACOS here) when the dataset sizes are small, and vice versa.\\nTable 4: Ablation of constrained decoding and effect of aggregation strategy on ASTE (L14) and ASQP (R15). \\u201cw\\/o cd\\u201d discards the constrained decoding during inference.

The gap between STF with gold AMR and STF with system AMR is small, demonstrating that STF is more robust to the potential errors from AMR parsing.\\nMost prior studies have been focusing on learning supervised models (Ji and Grishman, 2008; McClosky et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Wadden et al., 2019; Du and Cardie, 2020; Lin et al.,\\n2020; Zhang and Ji, 2021; Wang et al., 2022; wan; Nguyen et al., 2021) based on manually annotated event mentions. However, the performance of event extraction has been barely improved in recent years, and one of the main reasons lies in the data scarcity and imbalance of the existing event annotations. Several self-training and semi-supervised studies have been proposed to automatically enrich the event annotations. Huang and Riloff (2012) uses extraction patterns based on nouns that, by defnition, play a specifc role in an event, to automatically label more data. Li et al. (2014) proposes various event inference mechanisms to reveal additional missing event mentions. (Huang, 2020; Huang and Ji, 2020) propose semi-supervised learning to automatically induce new event types and their corresponding event mentions while the performance of old types is also improved. (Liao and Grishman, 2010, 2011b; Ferguson et al., 2018b) propose techniques to select a more relevant and informative corpus for self-training. All these studies cannot handle the noise introduced by the automatically labeled data properly. Compared with them, our STF framework leverages a scoring model to estimate the correctness of each pseudo-labeled example, which further guides the gradient learning of the event extraction model, thus it can effciently mitigate the impact of the noisy pseudo-labeled examples.\\nSelf-training has been studied for many years (Yarowsky, 1995; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2005) and widely adopted in many tasks including speech recognition (Kahn et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020), biomedical imaging (You et al., 2022a,b), parsing (McClosky et al., 2006; McClosky and Charniak, 2008), and pretraining (Du et al., 2021). Self-Training suffers from inaccurate pseudo labels (Arazo et al., 2020, 2019; Hu et al., 2021a) especially when the teacher model is trained on insuffcient and unbalanced datasets. To address this problem, (Pham et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021a; Hu et al., 2021a) propose to utilize the performance of the student model on the held-out labeled data as a Meta-Learning objective to update the teacher model or improve the pseudo-label generation process. Hu et al. (2021b) leverage the cosine distance between gradients computed on labeled data and pseudo-labeled data as feedback to guide the self-training process. (Mehta et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2021) leverage the span of named entities as constraints to improve semi-supervised semantic role labeling and syntactic parsing, respectively.\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities.

However, due to the black-box nature of the end-to-end neural architecture, it remains to be understood to what extent DSI possesses the basic indexing and retrieval abilities. To mitigate this gap, in this study, we defne and examine three important abilities that a functioning IR framework should possess, namely, exclusivity, completeness, and relevance ordering. Our analytical experimentation shows that while DSI demonstrates profciency in memorizing the unidirectional mapping from pseudo queries to document identifers, it falls short in distinguishing relevant documents from random ones, thereby negatively impacting its retrieval effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a multi-task distillation approach to enhance the retrieval quality without altering the structure of the model and successfully endow it with improved indexing abilities. Through experiments conducted on various datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous DSI baselines1.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Recent advancements in the feld of information retrieval (IR) have sparked a growing interest in Differentiable Search Index (DSI) (Tay et al., 2022). Unlike traditional methods, which involve building an index before retrieval (Dai and Callan, 2019; Nogueira et al., 2019a; Lin et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021), DSI and related techniques such as DSIQG (Zhuang et al., 2022) and NCI (Wang et al., 2022) do not rely on external indexes to store data. Instead, these methods map user queries directly to the identifers (IDs) of the relevant documents, providing a simpler and more effcient retrieval process. This novel autoregressive approach, represented by DSI, has expanded the potential IR applications due to its ease of use, minimal index storage requirements, and end-to-end retrievability.\\n\\nHowever, despite the novel retrieval mechanism of DSI, current DSI models still rely on relevance signals of query-passage pairs for training. These models, which map short texts to specifc document IDs, do not have an explicit interaction between the query and the document during retrieval, unlike dense retrieval models (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020; Hofst\\u00e4tter et al., 2021; Qu et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2021c; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Gao and Callan, 2021) and cross-attention rerankers (Nogueira et al., 2019b; Nogueira and Cho, 2019; Zheng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022b). This training approach and the inherent properties of the model may lead to two problems. First, due to the lack of explicit modeling of inter-document associations and an explicit querydocument relevance measurement, the model may only learn a unidirectional mapping from short texts to specifc IDs, without understanding how the document is relevant to the query, leading to somewhat random output in the ranking list. Second, to reduce computational complexity, DSI models often simply represent a document by a small number of tokens or pseudo-queries. However, this approach may result in a reduced capacity to differentiate between documents and capture crucial relevant information.\\nThis study aims to deepen the understanding of DSI by evaluating its suitability as an end-toend model for indexing and retrieval. To achieve this, DSI-QG (Zhuang et al., 2022), a recent enhancement of DSI using pseudo queries for the model training, is used as a representative model for analysis. Our argument is that a usable index of a non-boolean retrieval model should meet the following three conditions: 1) The document content in the index should have a one-to-one correspondence with the ID to ensure the stability of retrieval results; 2) The key information of the documents should be stored in the index as completely as possible to avoid the loss of information related to the query and thus affecting the retrieval results; 3) The model should be able to output documents in decreasing order of their relevance to the query. These three abilities are summarized as exclusivity, completeness, and relevance ordering. Our analytical experiments indicate that the currently available DSI models do not fully meet the requirements of a general end-to-end indexingretrieval model, which limits their conditions of use and signifcantly reduces their effectiveness, especially when compared to the state-of-the-art dense retrieval models, which, in contrast, is shown to better meet those requirements.\\n\\nTo this end, we investigate whether DSI models can be better trained to improve retrieval abilities while maintaining their simple structure and low storage cost. Specifcally, we propose utilizing a dense retrieval approach to provide effective supervision signals for training DSI models. To enhance exclusivity and completeness of DSI, we propose to improve the document representation to capture information from different granularities and flter key information using the document representation encoded by the dense retrieval model. To improve the ability to discriminate the relevance degree of different documents of DSI, we propose a new distillation-based training approach. By explicitly modeling the connections between documents, the model is able to reduce the randomness of the output results and improve retrieval performance, especially on datasets with deep pool annotations.\\nMajor contributions of this paper are tri-fold. 1) An empirical analysis of basic IR abilities indicates the potential weaknesses of existing DSI approaches. 2) Based on the analysis above, we propose a multi-task distillation approach to improve the effectiveness of DSI by learning from dense retrieval while keeping its advantages. 3) Further evaluation shows that our approach substantially improves retrieval effectiveness of DSI-QG.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"For exclusivity, Figure 1a reports $\\\\mathrm{Hits}(\\\\omega1$ to evaluate the ability of different models to recall the document ID when using either a cut-off of the initial text from the document or pseudo-queries as input. The results indicate that both BM25 and TCT-ColBERT exhibit exceptional performance in accurately recalling the corresponding document ID when being queried with the original text cut-off, and the accuracy increases with the length of the cut-off. However, DSI-QG can recall the correct document ID for pseudo-queries, but struggles to do so when queried with text cut-off from the document itself. This indicates that the specifcity of DSI-QG is limited mostly to mapping from pseudoqueries to the associated document IDs, and lacks the ability to determine the document to which a segment of the primary text pertains, which could negatively impact its retrieval effectiveness.\\nFor completeness, Figure1b shows the effectiveness of different retrieval methods in identifying important information in a document. Both BM25 and TCT-ColBERT have a high probability of accurately returning the correct document, with a probability above $95\\\\%$ when considering the top result, and over $99\\\\%$ when looking at the top 10 results. This suggests that both sparse and dense indexing methods effectively retain crucial content of the original document in relation to the user\\u2019s query. In contrast, DSI-QG lacks profciency in identifying the correct document, indicating that under the current training methodology, the differentiable search index may fail to capture important information, resulting in suboptimal performance.\\nFigure 1c plots the Relevance Ordering score (y-axis) at each ranking position ( $\\\\mathbf{\\\\dot{X}}$ -axis). As the ranking progresses further down, the difference between the returned documents of and randomly selected documents becomes increasingly insignifcant, which aligns with expectation. However, the second-ranked document of DSI-QG shows a signifcant decline in ros compared to TCT-ColBERT and BM25. As the ranking lowers, the differentiation between the returned documents of DSI-QG and randomly selected documents becomes increasingly indistinguishable. By the tenth document, approximately half of the random documents score higher, indicating a near-random distribution of the results of DSI-QG at that position. Based on the observations above, we propose to improve DSI-QG by a multi-task distillation approach.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The feld of information retrieval has recently seen a surge in interest in generative retrieval models. Examples of this approach include the docT5query (Nogueira et al., 2019a), which trains T5 models to generate document-related queries and adds them to the original documents for index construction, and SEAL (Bevilacqua et al., 2022b), which generates text fragments that the target document may contain and uses FM-Index (Ferragina and Manzini, 2000) for retrieval. GENRE (Cao et al., 2021) utilizes BART (Lewis et al., 2020) for entity name generation in entity retrieval tasks.\\nFurthermore, Tay et al. (2022) proposed the Differentiable Search Index (DSI), which explores various strategies for mapping string queries to document IDs based on T5 (Raffel et al., 2019). This idea has been further developed in models such as DSI-QG (Zhuang et al., 2022), NCI (Wang et al., 2022), and Ultron (Zhou et al., 2022), which have all effectively improved the retrieval performance of generative retrieval models through the use of pseudo queries. More specifcally, DSIQG (Zhuang et al., 2022) adapted the model for multilingual retrieval tasks, Ultron (Zhou et al., 2022) attempted to incorporate hyperlink information into document IDs, and NCI (Wang et al., 2022) employed richer data, more fne-grained semantic ID mapping, and a novel decoder structure to obtain the best retrieval results. Differentiable indexing models have also been applied to a wide range of tasks such as knowledge-intensive language tasks (Chen et al., 2022a), long sequence retireval (Lee et al., 2022b) and QA tasks (Yu et al., 2022). Additionally, efforts have been made to improve the memory capability (Mehta et al., 2022) and decoding capability (Lee et al., 2022a) of these models. This paper aims to gain a deeper understanding of differentiable indexing models as a retrieval method and proposes a multi-task distillation approach to improve their performance.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We summarized three essential abilities of a functional non-Boolean IR framework. Through an empirical analysis of these abilities, we identifed potential weaknesses in existing DSI approaches. To address these weaknesses, we propose a multitask distillation approach to enhance the effectiveness of DSI by learning from dense retrieval while preserving the advantages of DSI, such as minimal storage cost and end-to-end retrievability. Our evaluation results indicate that our proposed approach improves the three abilities of DSI and, as a result, its retrieval effectiveness, particularly on data with more comprehensive human annotations. There are several directions to explore. Firstly, the three capabilities identifed in our empirical analysis, although currently applied to DSI, can be further extended to analyze statistical retrieval methods as well. Additionally, investigating the trade-off between these three capabilities would be an interesting avenue for future research. Performing more comprehensive experiments to ascertain the effectiveness of retrieval models that rely on expanded queries for downstream tasks would yield valuable insights.\"}\n\n... # only display 6 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

To gain deeper insights into the hyperparameter sensitivity of our\\nmethods, we conducted an ablation study on the Aligning (T2) task, that highlights the influence of\\nkey hyperparameters on performance metrics. Specifically, for DDPM-GPT and BESO, we ablated\\nthe number of diffusion steps; for BeT, we focused on the number of action clusters, and for VAE-\\nACT, we ablated the scaling factor of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss term. The detailed\\nresults are presented in Figure 9.\\nOur findings reveal that increasing the number of diffusion steps primarily enhances behavior en-\\ntropy, signifying an improvement in the model\\u2019s capacity to capture multi-modalities. However,\\nfor BeT and VAE-ACT, we did not observe a consistent trend indicating a correlation between the\\nparameters and success rate or entropy.\\nInference Time Comparison. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of inference times for\\nall baseline models using both state- and image-based inputs.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction. Specifcally, for an input sentence $\\\\textbf{\\\\em x}$ , suppose we prompt a trained model to generate from $m$ selected permutations, and the set of predicted tuples for permutation pi is T p\\u2032i, which may contain one or more sentiment tuples, and then we can obtain the fnal aggregated result $T_{\\\\mathrm{MvP}}^{\\\\prime}$ by the following equation:\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Our methods outperform previous best baselines signifcantly in supervised settings among 4 tasks, 10 datasets, becoming the new state-of-the-art in all of them. As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities. MVP (transfer) trained with simple tasks (TASD and ASTE here) with adequate data can be easily transferred to tough tasks (ASQP and ACOS here) when the dataset sizes are small, and vice versa.\\nTable 4: Ablation of constrained decoding and effect of aggregation strategy on ASTE (L14) and ASQP (R15). \\u201cw\\/o cd\\u201d discards the constrained decoding during inference.
