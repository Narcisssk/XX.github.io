{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In this\\nexperiment, we examine how varying levels of equation complexity impact the performance of four\\nSR algorithms.\\n3.1\\nMethods\\n3.1.1\\nSymbolic Regression Algorithms\\nWe evaluate the performance of four of the best-performing SR algorithms from SRBench: gplearn 3,\\nAIFeynman [2], GP-GOMEA [26], [27], SBP-GP [28].\\ngplearn. The most traditional implementation of GP-based SR algorithm we tested is gplearn, which\\ninitializes a random population of models, then iterates through tournament selection, mutation, and\\ncrossover.\\nAIFeynman. AIFeynman is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that builds symbolic models [2]. It\\nemploys brute-force solvers and problem-decomposition techniques, including differentiated function\\napproximations. Here, we probed the most recent version of this method that combines Pareto\\noptimization with an information-theoretic complexity metric [29] to yield simple equations.\\nGP-GOMEA. GP-GOMEA is an extension of the GOMEA evolutionary algorithm to GP, designed to\\nefficiently mix and preserve beneficial tree structures in the population [26], [27].\\nSBP. Semantic backpropagation (SBP) computes a value at a tree node position to align the model\\u2019s\\noutput with the target [30]\\u2013[32]. We assess the GP SBP-GP algorithm[28], which enhances SBP-based\\nrecombination through dynamic adjustments of intermediate outputs with affine transformations.\\n3.1.2\\nDatasets\\nWe based all analyses reported below on an equation dataset resembling equations from the domain of\\nphysics. We first extracted equation priors based on the frequencies of tree structures, input variables,\\nconstants, operators, and functions of physics equations scraped from Wikipedia (see Appendix\\nA.3.4). We then generated 120 equations using those priors. Finally, we randomly sampled 1000 data\\npoints representing the input variables and output of the respective ground-truth equation. The input\\nvariables were sampled from the range [-10, 10].\\n3.2\\nMetrics\\nIndependent Variables: Complexity Metrics. Our primary interest lies in the effects of different\\ncomplexity metrics on the performance of SR algorithms. Here, we focus on the following metrics\\nextracted from each equation: (1) number of nodes, (2) expression tree depth, (3) number of input\\nvariables, (4) number of constants, and (5) number of trigonometric functions4.\\nDependent Variables: Performance Metrics. In the first analysis, we examine the impact of each com-\\nplexity metric on three performance measures commonly used to evaluate SR algorithms: symbolic\\n3Documentation can be found here: https:\\/\\/gplearn.readthedocs.io\\/en\\/stable\\/\\n4The number of trigonometric functions was used as complexity metric since it had been shown to impact\\nthe performance in various SR algorithms\\n4\\nsolution rate, normalized tree distance (NED), and mean square error (MSE). The symbolic solution\\nrate indexes if the predicted equation matches the ground truth or if it can be derived by scaling or\\nconstant shifting [1]. The NED measures the distance between the tree representations of the ground\\ntruth and predicted equations in terms of the number of tree modifications needed to transform the\\nlatter into the former [33]. We compute the MSE between the predicted and the ground truth equation\\non a randomly sampled set of hold-out conditions. For more details on each performance metric, see\\nAppendix A.3.3\\n3.3\\nSimulation Procedure\\nWe formatted the generated datasets to be compatible with SRBench, and executed the benchmarking5\\non the four algorithms using the following hyperparameters: 1 recovery trial allowed for each\\nalgorithm per equation, 16384 MB memory limit, nine hours time limit, and allowing for estimators\\nto be tuned on black-box regression problems. After obtaining a symbolic solution, we computed all\\nmetrics for the obtained symbolic model, including symbolic solution and MSE. We leveraged the\\nexpression tree representation described above to compute the complexity metrics and the NED.\\n3.4\\nAnalysis\\nWe first examine the degree to which each SR performance metric is impacted by (a) the SR algorithm\\nitself and (b) the complexity metric. Thus, for each complexity metric, we regress the respective\\nperformance metric against the complexity metric and the algorithms, using either a logistic regression\\n(for symbolic solution hit) or linear regression (for NED and MSE). An interaction effect between the\\ncomplexity metric and algorithms would indicate that different algorithms are differentially impacted\\nby the different complexity metrics.\\nIn the second analysis, we examine whether a given SR algorithm is capable of recovering the\\ncomplexity metric of the ground-truth equation, e.g., whether the output equation of an SR algorithm\\nhad as many constants as the data-generating equation. If a feature is recovered perfectly, the\\nregression should be an identity. Regression lines above the identity lines suggest overly complicated\\nexpressions in this feature, and regression lines below the identity lines suggest oversimplification of\\nthis feature.\\n3.5\\nResults\\nTable 1: Main effects of algorithm and complexity metrics for the logistic (symbolic solution\\nprobability) and linear regression (NED and MSE).\\nSymbolic Solution\\nNED\\nMSE\\nOR\\nCI\\np\\ncoef\\nCI\\np\\ncoef\\nCI\\np\\nIntercept\\n.88\\n[.66, 1.17]\\n.377\\n.42\\n[.37, .47]\\n<.001\\n.77\\n[.12, 1.43]\\n.02\\nAIFeynman\\n1.57\\n[1.04, 2.35]\\n.03\\n-.13\\n[-.2, -.07]\\n<.001\\n-.23\\n[-1.13, .68]\\n.625\\nGP-GOMEA\\n.74\\n[.5, 1.09]\\n.124\\n.13\\n[.07, .2]\\n<.001\\n.46\\n[-.43, 1.35]\\n.308\\nSBP-GP\\n.69\\n[.46, 1.04]\\n.073\\n.3\\n[.23, .36]\\n<.001\\n-.21\\n[-1.15, .74]\\n.667\\nNodes\\n.54\\n[.49, .6]\\n<.001\\n.04\\n[.03, .04]\\n<.001\\n.27\\n[.18, .37]\\n<.001\\nDepth\\n.2\\n[.16, .25]\\n<.001\\n.13\\n[.11, .14]\\n<.001\\n.89\\n[.62, 1.15]\\n<.001\\nVariables\\n.33\\n[.27, .4]\\n<.001\\n.12\\n[.11, .14]\\n<.001\\n1.34\\n[1.03, 1.65]\\n<.001\\nConstants\\n.35\\n[.29, .43]\\n<.001\\n.11\\n[.09, .14]\\n<.001\\n.02\\n[-.31, .36]\\n.886\\nTrigonometric\\n.15\\n[.06, .36]\\n<.001\\n.29\\n[.18, .4]\\n<.001\\n.31\\n[.18, .44]\\n<.001\\nNote.

Table 2 lists interaction effects between the algorithm and complexity metrics.\\nResults indicate that different complexity metrics differently impacted different algorithms. This\\neffect was most prevalent within the NED performance metric. For example, the interaction term for\\nAIFeynman and number of nodes is significant. For every node, the average NED increase compared\\nto gplearn is .02 units more. This means that the NED increases more rapidly as a function of nodes\\nfor AIFeynman, likely due to its simplicity bias. The interaction term for GP-GOMEA and node\\n6\\ncount is also significant. For each node, the average change in the NED is .03 units less compared to\\ngplearn. This indicates that the relationship between NED and complexity differs for the GP-GOMEA\\ngroup, with the NED increasing less steeply. Together, the significant interaction effects show that\\nthe different complexity metrics differentially impacts different algorithms, with some algorithms\\n(e.g., GP-GOMEA) scaling better with equation complexity (e.g., node count) compared to others\\n(e.g., AIFeynman).\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\nFigure 3: Recovered versus ground-truth equation complexity.

Table 3 shows the deviation of the regression line between\\nthe proposed and the ground truth metrics from the identity. We observed that the number of nodes\\nwas higher in the predicted equations for all algorithms other than the AIFeynman algorithm (which\\npredicted a lowe node number).

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Conclusion and Future Work\",\"section_content\":\"Conclusion and Future Work\\nWe introduced a new benchmarking approach for SR. In contrast to the existing datasets for bench-\\nmarking SR algorithms, the introduced benchmarking method relies on an expression sampler capable\\nof generating an arbitrary number of expressions. Critically, the user may generate those expressions\\nbased on user-defined metrics of equation complexity, such as a number of expression tree nodes,\\nexpression tree depth, or the number of variables, or based on priors for a specific domain (e.g.,\\nphysics). Using this sampler, we examined the performance of various SR methods based on different\\nequation complexity metrics. We found that the performance of the SR algorithms decreases with\\nequation complexity. In particular, we found that the degree to which the recovered and ground-truth\\nequations match one another as a function of different complexity metrics varies, with tree depth\\nbeing most often recovered and trigonometric functions least often.\\nOur results suggest that the benchmarking method can yield novel insights into the strengths and\\nweaknesses of existing SR algorithms, such as which kinds of equation complexities different\\nSR algorithms fail to capture. Insights into complexity-specific weaknesses may not just aid in\\nthe comparison of existing SR algorithms but may also help steer the development of novel SR\\nalgorithms. For instance, we observed that most SR algorithms we evaluated (except AIFeynman)\\noverestimate the complexity of an equation in terms of the number of expression tree nodes or the\\nnumber of trigonometric functions. This suggests that SR algorithms may benefit from biases against\\nsuch complexity.\\nA crucial yet unexplored feature of our benchmarking method pertains to the ability to sample\\nequations according to domain-specific priors. Existing (static) benchmarks for equations are often\\naligned with problems in physics, potentially tempting SR researchers to tailor their algorithms\\ntoward these datasets. This may come at the expense of generalizability across other types of\\nequations and scientific domains. For instance, in biology, equations may tend to incorporate more\\nexponential functions to model complex growth phenomena, while in physics, multiplications might\\ndominate equations describing physical laws. Future benchmarking efforts may benefit from evaluat-\\ning the domain-specificity of different SR algorithms by examining their performance across equation\\ndatasets generated from priors based on different scientific disciplines. Thus, our novel benchmark-\\ning approach not only offers a more flexible and comprehensive evaluation of SR algorithms but\\nalso highlights the need for future research to consider domain-specificity, thereby enhancing the\\ngeneralizability and adaptability of these algorithms across various scientific disciplines.\\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\\nThis project is in active development by the Autonomous Empirical Research Group.
