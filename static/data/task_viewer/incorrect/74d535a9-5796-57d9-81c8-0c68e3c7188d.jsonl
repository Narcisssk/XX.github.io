{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Ponti [CLS]\\nIvan Vuli\\u00b4\\nc [SEP]\\n[SEP]University of Cambridge\\n[CLS]University of Edinburgh\\nAbstract\\nLanguage models (LMs) are bound to their tokenizer, which maps raw text to a\\nsequence of vocabulary items (tokens). This restricts their flexibility: for example,\\nLMs trained primarily on English may still perform well in other natural and\\nprogramming languages, but have vastly decreased efficiency due to their English-\\ncentric tokenizer. To mitigate this, we should be able to swap the original LM\\ntokenizer with an arbitrary one, on the fly, without degrading performance. Hence,\\nin this work we define a new problem: Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer (ZeTT).\\nThe challenge at the core of ZeTT is finding embeddings for the tokens in the\\nvocabulary of the new tokenizer. Since prior heuristics for initializing embeddings\\noften perform at chance level in a ZeTT setting, we propose a new solution: we\\ntrain a hypernetwork taking a tokenizer as input and predicting the corresponding\\nembeddings. We empirically demonstrate that the hypernetwork generalizes to new\\ntokenizers both with encoder (e.g., XLM-R) and decoder LLMs (e.g., Mistral-7B).\\nOur method comes close to the original models\\u2019 performance in cross-lingual and\\ncoding tasks while markedly reducing the length of the tokenized sequence. We\\nalso find that the remaining gap can be quickly closed by continued training on\\nless than 1B tokens. Finally, we show that a ZeTT hypernetwork trained for a base\\n(L)LM can also be applied to fine-tuned variants without extra training. Overall,\\nour results make substantial strides toward detaching LMs from their tokenizer.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLanguage Models1 typically operate on discrete tokens, so they need a means to map text into a\\nsequence of tokens, namely a tokenizer. The vast majority of contemporary LMs use subword\\ntokenizers (Devlin et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Parmar et al., 2024, among\\nothers), whereas others use byte-level (Xue et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024) or\\ncharacter-level tokenizers (Clark et al., 2022; Tay et al., 2022). Regardless of the chosen tokenization\\n\\u2018granularity\\u2019, these models share a fundamental limitation: once they are trained with a particular\\ntokenizer, inference with a different tokenizer is impossible. In other terms, a pre-trained LM is\\n\\u201cbound\\u201d to the tokenizer it was trained with. This has wide-ranging implications: since the focus during\\npretraining is typically primarily on the English language, the tokenizer often encodes languages\\nbesides English (Rust et al., 2021) or other domains, such as code, less efficiently. This leads to\\nlarge disparities in the inference cost between English and non-English text (Ahia et al., 2023; Petrov\\net al., 2023). Tokenizers may also be sub-optimal for domains which they were not designed to be\\nused with, e.g. fine-tunings of the Llama models performing subpar on coding tasks (Dagan et al.,\\n2024). Efficiency and performance are only some of the reasons to transfer models across tokenizers:\\nmethods of interaction between models, such as ensembling (Sagi & Rokach, 2018) and model\\nmerging (Wortsman et al., 2022; Ainsworth et al., 2023; Yadav et al., 2023), typically assume the\\nsame unit of representation (i.e., equivalent tokenization) across models; if two models adopt different\\n1We adopt a broad definition of LMs that also includes models that do not define a probability distribution\\nover finite-length sequences, such as text encoders.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"LM\\u03c8\\ntext x\\n \\nTokenizer\\n(\\ud835\\udcb1\\n \\nHypernetwork \\nH\\u03b8\\nlogits\\n \\nInput Embedding\\nE\\u03d5b\\n \\nOutput Embedding\\nE\\u03d5b\\nFigure 1: The hypernetwork predicts input and output embeddings based on the tokenizer.\\ntokenizers, they become unsuitable for ensembling or merging. Problematic artifacts of tokenization\\nsuch as \\u2018Glitch tokens\\u2019 (Land & Bartolo, 2024) may also be fixed via transfer to a new tokenizer.\\nTo address these issues, past work developed methods to equip an LM with a new tokenizer by\\nretraining the embedding parameters, and optionally continuing to train the entire model (Artetxe\\net al., 2020; de Vries & Nissim, 2021). This adaptation can be made faster by initializing the\\nembedding parameters through heuristics (Tran, 2020; Minixhofer et al., 2022; Gee et al., 2022;\\nDobler & de Melo, 2023; Liu et al., 2023). In this work, we formulate a new problem: given an LM,\\ncan we create an embedding matrix on-the-fly for any arbitrary tokenizer, without ever observing\\ndata for it? While past work investigated n-shot tokenizer transfer, we refer to this new problem as\\nzero-shot tokenizer transfer (ZeTT). If the performance of the model can be approximately preserved,\\nZeTT effectively \\\"detaches\\\" LMs from the tokenizer they were trained with. We first evaluate the\\nefficacy of prior (heuristic-based) approaches for ZeTT, finding that, while heuristics can preserve\\nperformance to some extent, there is generally a large gap to the original LM performance.\\nTo close this gap, we introduce a new paradigm: We train a hypernetwork on a diverse distribution\\nof tokenizers to predict the embedding parameters for any given tokenizer. By investing in the\\none-time cost of training the hypernetwork, we aim to subsequently enable effective ZeTT. This\\nproves to be possible: ZeTT via the hypernetwork preserves performance to a few percent accuracy\\nin many cases. Furthermore, the hypernetwork can learn to rapidly adapt to a given target tokenizer\\nby continued training on a small amount (<1B) of extra tokens, whereas previous work typically\\nneeded hundreds of billions of tokens (Dagan et al., 2024). As such, our hypernetwork provides a\\nstate-of-the-art solution to n-shot tokenizer transfer, while also establishing a competitive baseline\\nfor our newly introduced zero-shot tokenizer transfer problem. This unlocks a range of new ways to\\ncombine language models with tokenizers. For example, in this work, we zero-shot substitute the\\nMistral-7B tokenizer (Jiang et al., 2023) with a tokenizer that encodes code using 10% fewer tokens\\non average, while preserving functional code generation correctness to approx. 3% (Section 4.2).\\nWe also evaluate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer of the multilingual XLM-R encoder model to a\\nrange of different languages by substituting the XLM-R tokenizer with a target-language specific\\ntokenizer and reusing adapters trained for the original XLM-R. This leads to a >16% speedup and\\npreserves performance on XNLI (Conneau et al., 2018) to 1% on average. Finally, we show that a\\nhypernetwork trained for a base large LM (e.g. Mistral-7B) can also be applied to fine-tunings of the\\nsame model (e.g. Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1), preserving capabilities to a large extent (Section 4.3).\\n2\\nBackground\\nTokenizers and Embeddings. Tokenizers operate as a tokenization function T mapping a text to a\\nsequence of elements in the vocabulary V. By the term tokenizer, we henceforth refer to the tuple\\ncomprising the two crucial components, (V, T). Importantly, the vocabulary and the tokenization\\nfunction are distinct components; given some vocabulary, there are many ways to encode text\\nas a sequence of tokens in this vocabulary (e.g. Hofmann et al., 2022; Uzan et al., 2024). After\\ntokenization, the model represents the sequence of tokens via a function E\\u03d5 : V \\u2192Rdmodel (the\\nembeddings). The embeddings are typically parametrized by a matrix \\u03d5 as a lookup table which\\nassigns a distinct dmodel-dimensional vector (a row of the matrix) to every element in V. Embeddings\\nare used twice in the language model: once at the input to map tokens to a fixed-size vector, and\\nagain at the output to compute a logit for every token, typically via a dot-product of E\\u03d5(t) with the\\nfinal hidden state of the LM. Embedding parameters may or may not be shared between the input and\\nthe output;2 our method works with both. We denote the entire set of embedding parameters via \\u03d5,\\ndenoting input embeddings as \\u03d5in and output embeddings as \\u03d5out, if necessary.\\n2Some models share the input and the output embedding parameters (e.g. Conneau et al., 2020), this has been\\nshown to be problematic (Chung et al., 2021) and many recent LLMs (e.g. Jiang et al., 2023) separate them.\\n2\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"Contemporary language models typically use subword tokenizers via BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) or\\nUnigramLM (Kudo, 2018). Subword tokenization is a common choice since it can represent arbitrary\\nsequences of text (\\\"open-vocabulary\\\" language modeling) while largely retaining the efficiency of\\nword-level models (Mielke et al., 2021). However, there are a number of problems with the (lack\\nof) robustness of subword tokenization (Xue et al., 2022; Golkar et al., 2023). A recent strand of\\nwork aims to get rid of subword tokenization via byte-level (so-called \\\"token-free\\\") models (Xue\\net al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023). However, these models still operate on tokens, using the set of 256\\nbytes as the vocabulary, and UTF-8 as the tokenization function (Mielke et al., 2021). In a similar\\nvein, some models use character-level tokenization (Tay et al., 2022; Clark et al., 2022), optionally\\nlearning to pool characters into longer tokens (Nawrot et al., 2023). So far, byte- or character-level\\napproaches have been unable to supplant subword tokenization due to longer sequences resulting\\nin higher compute requirements, and not necessarily being more robust (Libovick\\u00fd et al., 2022).\\nThus, although our approach is applicable to any tokenizer, we focus our experiments on subword\\ntokenizers. Specifically, we use the UnigramLM parametrization of the tokenization function, and\\nshow that other tokenizers can be converted to this parametrization later in Section 5. UnigramLM\\nsets T(x) := argmaxC\\u2208Cx\\nP\\nt\\u2208C log p(t) where Cx is the set of all possible decompositions of x in\\nV. This provides a convenient way to represent tokens as a 2-tuple (t, p(t)) \\u2208(V, R).\\nEmbedding Initialization Heuristics. Prior work transfers LMs to a new tokenizer by initializing\\nembedding parameters via a heuristic, then continuing to train the embeddings. We denote the\\noriginal tokenizer as (Va, Ta) and the original embedding parameters as \\u03d5a. Analogously, the target\\ntokenizer is (Vb, Tb) with embedding parameters \\u03d5b. FVT (Gee et al., 2022) initializes embeddings\\nfor any new token t \\u2208Vb as the mean of the embeddings of Ta(t) i.e. the mean of the sequence of\\nembeddings the new token is decomposed into by the previous tokenizer Ta. RAMEN (Tran, 2020),\\nWECHSEL (Minixhofer et al., 2022) and OFA (Liu et al., 2023) require auxiliary embeddings\\nEaux : Vaux \\u2192Rdaux with |Vaux \\u2229Va| \\u0338\\u226a|Va| and |Vaux \\u2229Vb| \\u0338\\u226a|Vb|. They use Eaux to embed tokens\\nin Va and Vb in the same semantic space, then initialize embeddings in E\\u03d5b as a weighted average\\nof embeddings in E\\u03d5a with weights given by their similarity in Eaux. FOCUS (Dobler & de Melo,\\n2023) initializes embeddings of tokens in Vb \\\\ Va as a weighted combination of the overlapping\\ntokens Va \\u2229Vb, and copies the embeddings of the overlapping tokens. Weights are again computed\\nusing an auxiliary embedding matrix Eaux, but the only requirement is |Vaux \\u2229Vb| \\u0338\\u226a|Vb|. We use\\nFOCUS as the main baseline since Dobler & de Melo (2023) show it obtains better performance\\nwithout any training (i.e., zero-shot) than other heuristics, which we also confirm later in Section 4.2.\\nHeuristic-Free Tokenizer Transfer. In addition to heuristics, there is also research into changing the\\ntraining procedure to facilitate n-shot tokenizer transfer. Marchisio et al. (2023) show that forward-\\nand backward-propagating through a subset of the model layers is sufficient for learning embeddings\\nfor a new tokenizer. Chen et al. (2023) find that regularly resetting the embedding parameters during\\npretraining boosts the speed at which they are relearnt upon transfer. These approaches can be seen\\nas orthogonal to ours. They could be freely combined with our method; we leave this to future work.\\nEmbedding Prediction Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks are networks that predict the parameters of\\nanother network (Ha et al., 2017). Prior work uses hypernetworks to predict embeddings for out-of-\\nvocabulary (Pinter et al., 2017) or rare words (Schick & Sch\\u00fctze, 2019, 2020) of word embedding\\nmodels (Mikolov et al., 2013) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019).

Importantly, however, we\\ndo not make any specific assumptions on L.\\nNote that the loss of the language model under the original tokenizer Ta on a text x is L(Ta(x), \\u03d5a, \\u03c8).\\nWe train our hypernetwork to minimize the loss L\\u03b8(Tb(x), H\\u03b8(Vb, Tb), \\u03c8). That is, we substitute the\\noriginal embedding parameters for the hypernet predictions, and substitute the original tokenizer for\\na tokenizer (Vb, Tb). Figure 1 illustrates the flow of information.\\nDefining Distributions over Texts and Tokenizers. We follow standard practice and sample texts\\nuniformly from the training corpus. Tokenizer sampling is not as trivial: we would like a distribution\\nover tokenizers (Vb, Tb) with high variance to encourage generalization to unseen tokenizers. To this\\nend, we introduce a procedure to sample a diverse set of UnigramLM tokenizers. We show later in\\nSection 5 that arbitrary tokenizers can be well-approximated via UnigramLM, motivating this choice.\\nWe initially fill a queue q with n texts sampled randomly from the training corpus and, at every step\\nin the training loop, push the m texts in the current batch and remove the m least recently added texts.\\nWe then compute all substrings t up to length l and their frequency in q.34 We add Gaussian noise to\\nthe frequencies to arrive at a final score p(t) for every token t. Finally, we assemble the tokenizer by\\ntaking the top k tokens with the highest p(t) as the vocabulary and UnigramLM parametrized by p(t)\\nas the tokenization function. The training loop is summarized in Algorithm 1. The \\u2018rolling\\u2019 queue of\\ntexts q ensures high variance in the vocabulary, while the Gaussian noise added to the frequencies\\nensures high variance in the tokenization function.\\nImportantly, the texts and the tokenizer are sampled dependently: the batch of m texts used for\\ntraining is a subset of the n texts used for sampling the tokenizer. If they were sampled independently,\\nthe probability for a token to occur would be p(token) \\u221dp(token \\u2208Vb) \\u00d7 p(token \\u2208x). Since both\\nthese factors are small for rare tokens, p(token) would get vanishingly small in this case.\\nMIMICK-Style Warmup & Auxiliary Loss. In practice, directly minimizing L\\u03b8 starting from\\nrandomly initialized \\u03b8 is difficult. Thus, we include a warmup stage where we train the hypernetwork\\nto mimic the embedding parameters of the original tokenizer, akin to MIMICK (Pinter et al., 2017).\\nLwarmup\\n\\u03b8\\n= \\u2225H\\u03b8(Va, Ta) \\u2212\\u03d5a\\u22252\\n3In practice, implementing q as a queue allows efficiently caching the substrings and their probability p(t) at\\nthis step. They only need to be recomputed for the new m texts encountered in every batch.\\n4To ensure substrings do not cross word boundaries we pretokenize the text before computing substrings.\\n4\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
