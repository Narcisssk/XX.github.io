{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, the choice of granularity at which DP is applied is often neglected. For example, neural machine translation (NMT) typically operates on the sentencelevel granularity. From the perspective of DP, this setup assumes that each sentence belongs to a single person and any two sentences in the training dataset are independent. This assumption is however violated in many real-world NMT datasets, e.g., those including dialogues. For proper application of DP we thus must shift from sentences to entire documents. In this paper, we investigate NMT at both the sentence and document levels, analyzing the privacy\\/utility trade-off for both scenarios, and evaluating the risks of not using the appropriate privacy granularity in terms of leaking personally identifable information (PII). Our fndings indicate that the document-level NMT system is more resistant to membership inference attacks, emphasizing the signifcance of using the appropriate granularity when working with DP.1\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"With increasing concerns about the privacy of individuals and data leakage from NLP systems (Carlini et al., 2021), a method that has gained popularity in privacy-preserving NLP is Differential Privacy (DP) (Hu et al., 2024). However, the exact manner in which DP is applied to a textual dataset has numerous pitfalls. The unit of privacy is one among them, i.e. the granularity at which we assume an individual \\u2018data point\\u2019 (e.g. sentences, documents, and so forth) (Ponomareva et al., 2022; Igamberdiev and Habernal, 2023), with an assumption of independence among data points (Dwork and Roth, 2013).\\nOne particular task that has recently raised many privacy concerns is neural machine translation (NMT). Applying DP at the sentence level for NMT may break the independence assumption if more than one sentence is associated with a single individual (Brown et al., 2022), as depicted in Figure 1. In such cases, scaling up the unit of privacy to the document level by grouping related sentences overcomes the violated privacy protection which \\u2018pretends\\u2019 all sentences are independent, i.e. the status quo.\\nThe main objective of this paper is to compare the use of DP for NMT systems and datasets at the sentence and document levels, focusing on the level of privacy protection offered. First, we investigate the trade-off between privacy and utility for different levels of granularity (sentence vs. document) during the training process of an NMT system. Specifcally, we examine how performance is affected when applying DP with varying levels of privacy guarantees and granularity. Secondly, we aim to evaluate the risks of not using a proper privacy granularity during the training process of an NMT system through data extraction attacks on these systems.\\nOur contributions are as follows. (1) We propose a novel approach to apply differential privacy to NMT systems at the document level, utilizing the DP-NMT framework (Igamberdiev and Habernal, 2023) and the mLongT5 model (Uthus et al., 2023). The evaluation results show that the document-level NMT system is extremely sensitive to the privacy budget $(\\\\varepsilon)$ , which can signifcantly affect performance and lead to a drop in utility. We therefore suggest training the document-level NMT system on a larger, non-sensitive dataset, such as WMT22 (Kocmi et al., 2022), to achieve a better trade-off between privacy and utility on the downstream dataset with DP. (2) We apply the lossbased membership inference attack (MIA) (Yeom et al., 2018) to detect private information in NMT systems at both the sentence and document levels. Based on this MIA, we create an evaluation schema for personally identifable information (PII) to estimate the percentage of potential information leakage. Our results show that the document-level NMT system is more robust against the loss-based MIA than the sentence-level NMT system, demonstrating the importance of using the proper granularity when working with DP.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We refer to Appendix A for a detailed explanation of Differential Privacy and DP-SGD.\\nA key aspect of applying DP to text is that we cannot simply utilize group privacy (Dwork and Roth, 2013) to achieve document-level privacy from sentence-level privacy. Since DP-SGD leverages the Approximate DP defnition (Dwork and Roth, 2013), the $\\\\delta$ value, i.e. the probability of privacy leakage occurring, is not 0 when applying group privacy. If the number of data points $k$ in which two neighboring datasets differ is large enough, $\\\\delta$ will exceed 1 due to scaling with a factor of $k e^{(k-1)\\\\varepsilon}$ . Moreover, using relaxed DP defnition such as Renyi DP (Mironov, 2017) to avoid including the $\\\\delta$ value will scale $\\\\varepsilon$ to a very large value that is practically unmanageable, also resulting in a very weak privacy guarantee.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since datasets used to train neural models often contain confdential user information, they may be vulnerable to privacy risks (Hu et al., 2022). The trained models are often over-paramet erized, meaning they can memorize information about their training dataset (Mireshghallah et al., 2022).\\nThey exhibit a different behavior on training data compared to test data, with model parameters storing information about specifc training data unit. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether specifc examples are members of the training dataset (Hu et al., 2022). In general, an MIA is actually a binary classifer, which is designed to distinguish a target model\\u2019s behavior of its training members from the non-members.\\nThe frst MIA was proposed by Shokri et al. (2017), utilizing shadow datasets that have similar distribution to the original training data. Multiple shadow models are trained on these datasets, which are meant to mimic the behavior of the target model. The output predictions of these models are then used as input to a fnal binary classifcation model. This model detects whether a given data point belongs to the target model or not.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Several works attempted to pre-train language models with DP-SGD (Anil et al., 2022; Yin and Habernal, 2022; Ponomareva et al., 2022). With a signifcant computational burden of pre-training with DP-SGD, fnetuning pre-trained language models using DP-SGD has seen increased research over the past few years (Senge et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022). The main objective is to utilize a pre-trained checkpoint of a model that was created by using a publicly available corpus of data, such as Wikipedia or C4 (Raffel et al., 2020) and then fne-tune it on a private downstream dataset with DP-SGD. Although fne-tuning is more effcient than pre-training, it still requires a large amount of data on text generation tasks to achieve good performance, e.g. language modeling (Li et al., 2022) or NMT (Igamberdiev et al., 2024). The aforementioned related works only concentrate on the protection of the gradient at the sentence level. In contrast, the current work is concerned with the protection of the gradient at the document level.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Sentence-level NMT is the most common method of machine translation because it is simpler to train and evaluate with existing large datasets and evaluation metrics (Post and Junczys-Dowmunt, 2023). The primary limitation is due to the NMT model\\u2019s memory consumption for sequence length, resulting in a larger memory footprint when increased.\\nSecondly, popular datasets, such as WMT (Fernandes et al., 2021), exist only for sentence-level machine translation, even though they were originally created as documents. Nonetheless, this approach has its limitations, as demonstrated in the current study, which is the related privacy issue with DPSGD at the sentence level. Moreover, from the perspective of machine translation, a sentence-level MT model is not suitable for translating lengthy documents without taking their context into account (Wicks and Post, 2023; Wu et al., 2023). Recent related works on document-level machine translation can be separated into two categories: Encoder-Decoder Models and Decoder Only Models.\\nEncoder-Decoder Models Most of the recent works focus on the standard Transformer model (Wu et al., 2023; Zhuocheng et al., 2023a). Typically, they concatenate multiple sentences to form a document with the length up to 512 or maximum 1024 tokens for training. However, the naive approach generally suffers from a length bias problem, which causes signifcant degradation in translation quality when decoding documents that are much shorter or longer than the maximum sequence length during training (Zhuocheng et al., 2023a).\\nDecoder Only Models Unlike the vast majority of the training\\/fne-tuning paradigm, recent works (Hendy et al., 2023; Karpinska and Iyyer, 2023) suggest that Generative Pre-Training (GPT) models (Radford et al., 2018) are able to achieve very competitive translation quality on documentlevel translation. As such, they use a few-shot prompting technique to translate a document, employing ChatGPT2. The prompt displays examples of each translated sentence pair frst and instructs the model to consider the context when translating, as in a document.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}

To make the conversations publicly available, the data was frst anonymized using the Unbabel proprietary anonymization tool and then manually verifed.\\nEuroparl The Europarl (Koehn, 2005) dataset is a widely used parallel corpus in the feld of machine translation.
