{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Many efforts incorporate knowl-\\nedge information to improve the performance of\\ndialogue generation models (Zhou et al., 2018; Di-\\nnan et al., 2019; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019; Kim\\net al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020a; Zheng et al., 2021;\\nZhao et al., 2022a; Bao et al., 2022). However,\\nthese methods always face the hallucination prob-\\nlem, that is, the dialogue generation model may\\ninsist on an inappropriate knowledge and generate\\nresponses that inconsistent with the facts (Rashkin\"}\n{\"text_content\":\"et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022a; Dziri et al., 2022).\\nWe argue that the hallucination problem primar-\\nily caused by two aspects: (1) The optimization ob-\\njective is usually polarized by the gold knowledge-\\ndialogue samples and general dialogue samples\\nwithout knowledge in current knowledge-grounded\\ndialogue datasets (Zhou et al., 2018; Gopalakrish-\\nnan et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2019; Wu et al.,\\n2019; Komeili et al., 2022). Few datasets consider\\nteaching models how to respond when dealing with\"}\n{\"text_content\":\"incomplete correct knowledge, which makes the\\nmodels tend to believe in the given knowledge,\\nregardless of whether the knowledge is appropri-\\nate or not, resulting in hallucination problems. In\\naddition, the knowledge retrieval system tends to\\nextract irrelevant knowledge rather than relevant\\nknowledge when the database is large, aggravating\\nthe hallucinations (Reimers and Gurevych, 2021;\\nLiu et al., 2022). (2) The generation of knowledge\\nmay also face the hallucination problem and obtain\"}\n{\"text_content\":\"the inappropriate knowledge, leading the genera-\\ntion of hallucination responses (Kim et al., 2020;\\nZhao et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2022; Adolphs et al.,\\n2021; Bao et al., 2022).\\nTo mitigate the hallucination problem, we pro-\\npose an Augmentative and Contrastive Knowl-\\nedge Dialogue Expansion Framework (ACK-DEF),\\nwhich is inspirited by human communicating that\\npeople will replay euphemistic response for the un-\\nrecognizable knowledge.

Not only the\\nknowledge, we also designed the reply patterns for\\nthe knowledge with different level of errors.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities. MVP (transfer) trained with simple tasks (TASD and ASTE here) with adequate data can be easily transferred to tough tasks (ASQP and ACOS here) when the dataset sizes are small, and vice versa.\\nTable 4: Ablation of constrained decoding and effect of aggregation strategy on ASTE (L14) and ASQP (R15). \\u201cw\\/o cd\\u201d discards the constrained decoding during inference.
