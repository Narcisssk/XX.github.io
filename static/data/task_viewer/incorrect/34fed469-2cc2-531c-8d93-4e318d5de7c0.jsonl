{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In Sec. 2.1, we set the maximum number of magnitude tokens,\\nnbin = 256, for TP-BERTa. In fact, the C4.5 decision tree splits the value range in a greedy fashion,\\nand the actual number of leaves can be less than 256 (e.g., a small dataset with less than 256 points).\\nHence, we choose a conservative method to balance between \\u201cnot too many new words to learn\\u201d and\\n\\u201cenough precision for relative magnitude representation\\u201d. In Table 5, we present the performance\\nchanges by setting nbin to 32 and 128 separately. As expected, the overall performance gradually\\ndrops when using a smaller token number to represent the numerical value magnitude. We find\\nthat some datasets favor a smaller nbin, which may be attributed to over-representation of too many\\nmagnitude tokens. Thus, a better solution is to set a large nbin for pre-training in order to enhance\\nthe upper limit of magnitude representation capability, and search for a reasonable dataset-specific\\nnbin on downstream tasks.\\n12\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nA\\nLIMITATIONS\\nSince our TP-BERTa relies on the semantic knowledge of LMs to transfer feature patterns from\\npre-training feature names to downstream ones, it implicitly requires meaningful and clear feature\\nsemantics. However, in the real world, there always exist tables with unclear feature names or values,\\nsuch as quantum physics experiment tables containing lots of uncommon quantum descriptor feature\\nnames and medical domain substituting specific feature values with meaningless encoding to protect\\npatient privacy. This suggests that LM-based tabular DNNs cannot take their inherent advantages of\\nfeature semantic understanding in privacy-sensitive (e.g., federated learning) or semantic-incomplete\\n(missing original meanings in data collection) tables. For an uncommon domain, LMs pre-trained on\\ndomain corpora may be utilized as base models. Besides, LMs own a larger space of parameters and\\nhyperparameters, making them more time-consuming in hyperparameter tuning with a potentially\\nhigher performance ceiling compared to non-LM tabular DNNs. Hence, we directly finetune TP-\\nBERTa with default hyperparameters for fairness of time, in which case it can achieve adequate\\nresults with less time than other tuned methods.\\nB\\nDATASET INFORMATION AND MAIN EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\\nWe provide detailed information of the pre-training datasets in Table 6 and detailed information\\nof the downstream datasets in Table 7 and Table 9.

It provides various tools and features to streamline the model development process, including\\nversion control, performance monitoring, and collaboration capabilities. As for managing datasets, ModelScope\\noffers robust functionality for organizing, storing, and accessing data. Users can upload datasets to the platform,\\nwhere they are securely stored and can be easily accessed by authorized team members. ModelScope also\\nsupports versioning of datasets, allowing users to track changes over time and ensure reproducibility in their\\nexperiments. Additionally, the platform provides tools for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis,\\nhelping users to efficiently prepare their data for model training and evaluation. Overall, ModelScope offers\\ncomprehensive support for managing datasets throughout the machine learning lifecycle. Therefore, we choose\\nModelScope as our hosting platform.\\nUsage of ModelScope.\\nTo enable users to directly utilize all models on the ModelScope platform without\\nconfiguring the environment, ModelScope integrates an online Notebook programming environment on its\\nwebsite and offers official mirrors for developers. These official mirrors allow users to bypass all installation and\\nconfiguration steps, providing immediate access to the models. Currently the latest version of the CPU mirror\\nand GPU mirror can be obtained from the office ModelScope repository.\\nUsers also can setup local python environment using following commands:\\n1\\nconda\\ncreate -n modelscope\\npython =3.8\\n2\\nconda\\nactivate\\nmodelscope\\n3 pip\\ninstall\\nmodelscope\\nThen, users can access and enjoy our dataset by:\\n1 from\\nmodelscope.msdatasets\\nimport\\nMsDataset\\n2 ds =\\nMsDataset.load(\\u2018yutong\\/UKnow \\u2019,\\u2423subset_name =\\u2018default \\u2019, split=\\u2018train \\u2019)\\n17\\nBesides, we strongly recommend that users read the official documents for optimal use.\\nMaintenance Plan.\\nIn future work, we will persistently augment the dataset across various scales following\\nthe UKnow protocol. This endeavor aims to furnish a comprehensive, diverse, and resilient multimodal\\nknowledge graph, thereby facilitating subsequent research endeavors.\\nB\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Datasets\",\"section_content\":\"DATASETS\\nB.1\\nRAVEN AND I-RAVEN\\nFigure 5 displays seven image con\\ufb01gurations of RAVEN (Zhang et al., 2019a).
