{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"6.1 Experimental Setup\",\"section_content\":\"Setting. To comprehensively evaluate the multitask learning ability and the generalization ability, suppose we have $N$ datasets, we evaluate our proposed framework in three settings: (1) All Task MTL. In this setting, we train our model on the mixed union of $N$ datasets and evaluate it on each individual dataset. (2) Leave-one-out. In this setting, we train our model on $N-1$ datasets and test on the left one dataset to evaluate a model\\u2019s zero-shot generalization ability. (3) Low-resource. To further evaluate the generalization capability of our method, after training on other $N-1$ datasets in the leave-one-out setting, we fne-tune the model on the left dataset with only $10\\\\%$ data available, and test the model on the left one dataset.\\n\\nDatasets. We use $N=9$ datasets to evaluate our framework: Cornell Movies (Danescu-NiculescuMizil and Lee, 2011), DailyDialog (Li et al., 2017), CMU_DoG (Zhou et al., 2018b), LIGHT (Urbanek et al., 2019), EmpatheticDialog (Rashkin et al., 2019), ConvAI2 (Dinan et al., 2020), Wizard of Wikipedia (Dinan et al., 2019), Mutual (Cui et al., 2020) and CommonsenseDialog (Zhou et al., 2021). Each dataset embodies one or more specifc skills. More details about the datasets could be found in Appendix B.\\nBaselines. We use BART (Lewis et al., 2020) as one of our baselines, which is a standard sequenceto-sequence transformer pre-trained on the same corpus as Liu et al. (2019); We also compare against R2C2, a BlenderBot-like open-domain dialogue model trained in a multi-task way by Shuster et al. (2022a) and hold the current stateof-the-art on many datasets (Zhang et al., 2022). For parameter-effcient technique in multi-task learning, we compare our method with prefxtuning (Li and Liang, 2021). We also draw a comparison with the recent proposed Modular Skill (MS) (Ponti et al., 2022), a modular network that allows each task to choose its skill toolkit and optimize the global skill inventory together with the choice of each task jointly. For a fair comparison, we use BART-large ( 406M) and R2C2-base ( 400M) in our experiments. The parameter scale of Prefx-tuning ( 415M) and MS ( 448M) are both comparable with ours.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"7 Further Analysis\",\"section_content\":\"All Task MTL. The experiment results are shown in Table 1. We could observe that (1) our proposed approach outperforms BART and R2C2 on most datasets. The advantage of our modular framework over prefx-tuning is also obvious, possibly because prefx-tuning hinders positive transfer among corpora. To have a more comprehensive understanding of our approach, we investigate the schedule frequency of modules on different datasets and it reveals that our modular design captures some distinctive patterns in different corpora. More information could be found in Appendix F.\\n(2) Meanwhile, we also provide the performance of the current state-of-the-art for each individual dataset2. We could observe that when trained in a multi-task way, our framework is superior or comparable to the SOTA without a sophisticated design of model architecture and learning algorithm for each individual dataset, which further verifes the capacity of our model to transfer knowledge from other corpus and manipulate multiple skills.\\nLeave-one-out. The results are shown in Table 2. There is a gap in performance between the baseline and ours, especially on Wizard of Wikipedia. It can be understood that Wizard of Wikipedia is less similar to other datasets since it contains some formal sentences from Wikipedia. Thus, zero-shot generalization on the dataset is more diffcult. We can conclude that our model generalizes better than BART and R2C2, possibly because the modular framework could recursively compose the computations by modules to cope with new situations with existing knowledge. Besides, the comparison with MS further verdict the necessity of intermediate supervision for each module.\\nLow-resource The results are shown in Table 3. The proposed method attains a better performance than BART. Notably, our modular generation framework surpasses the fully supervised approach on DailyDialog, EmpatheticDialog, LIGHT and CommonsenseDialog, validating the potential of the compositional modular paradigm as a general method in the low-resource setting.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"7.1 Single Transfer Relation\",\"section_content\":\"To explore whether our framework enhances transfer in a multi-task learning scenario, we further draw a comparison in a single-task scenario where we train and test our model and all the baselines on each individual dataset. The experiment results are shown on Table 4. When comparing with Table 1, we could see that our approach achieves a positive transfer on most datasets while negative transfer is more common for baseline methods. It demonstrates that our modular design effectively alleviates the intra-operator transfer.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"7.4 Qualitative Evaluation\",\"section_content\":\"Automatic metrics are not perfect for evaluating an open-domain task (Dinan et al., 2019) and human evaluation is necessary. Concretely, in the all-task MTL setting, we randomly sample 300 responses from each dataset generated by ours and baseline methods and recruit well-educated native speakers to rate them. Each annotator is required to give a score ranging from 1 to 3. 1 means the response is correct in grammar and fuent; 2 means the response is coherent to the context and satisfes the requirements of 1. 3 means the response exhibits versatile skills if necessary including showing empathy, grounding on knowledge, commonsense inference, etc. Besides, the response should also meet the requirements of 2. Agreement of the annotators is measured via Fleiss\\u2019 kappa (Fleiss, 1971). As is shown in Table 7, the responses generated by our approach enjoy a higher quality, demonstrating the superiority of the modular generation framework. The evaluation results are also consistent with automatic evaluation.\\nA case study could be found in Appendix F.\"}\n\nIn total, 4 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
