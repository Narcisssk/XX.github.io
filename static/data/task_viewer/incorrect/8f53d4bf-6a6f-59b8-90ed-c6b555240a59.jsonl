{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

(2023) frst proposed to divide temporal reasoning into three levels: time-time reasoning (L1), time-event reasoning (L2), and event-event reasoning (L3). In this paper, we focus on the harder temporal reasoning types: time-event reasoning (L2) and event-event reasoning (L3). We construct our dataset by the following steps:\\nMining Temporal Facts in Wikidata We frst extract all the knowledge triples that have temporal qualifers (such as start_time and end_time) in the Wikidata (Vrande\\u02c7ci\\u00b4c and Kr\\u00f6tzsch, 2014) knowledge base (2023\\/03\\/20 dump). We then reformat the extracted triples into temporal quintuples $(s,r,o,t_{s},t_{e})$ , where $s$ is the subject, $r$ is the relation, $o$ is the object, $t_{s}$ is the start time, and $t_{e}$ is the end time. We then group the quintuples with the same subject together, obtaining $S\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\{(s,r_{i},o_{i},t_{s i},t_{e i})|i\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,1...N\\\\}$ . Unlike prior works from Wikidata (Chen et al., 2021; Tan et al., 2023), where only one relation type is kept within one group, we include multiple relation types in one group, which adds more complexity to our dataset. For each group, we identify the most common relation as its representative relation. Since the relation distribution is highly imbalanced in the Wikidata KB, we set a ceiling of 250 groups for each representative relation type. In the end, we kept 2,000 temporal quintuple groups, and on average there are 9.2 temporal quintuples in each group. We divide the groups into training (1,000), development (500), and test (500) sets.\\nCreating Questions from Quintuples After obtaining the temporal quintuple groups, we create the question-answer pairs based on manually designed templates (details are shown in Appendix F). For L2 temporal questions, a 1-hop question can be expressed in the query $(s,r,?,t_{r})$ , where $t_{r}$ is the reference timestamp. We create the multi-hop L2 questions with two variations: (1) $(s,r,?,t_{r s},t_{r e})$ , where $t_{r s}$ and $t_{r e}$ refer to the start and end time of the question respectively. (2) $(s,r,?,t_{r},\\\\Delta t)$ , where $t_{r}$ is the reference time and $\\\\Delta t$ is the temporal difference between the reference time and the query time. The model is expected to infer the query time from $\\\\Delta t$ and $t_{r}$ . As for the L3 questions, the number of temporal hops is dependent on the event-event temporal relation. For example, from the question \\u201cWhat team did Kobe Bryant play for before the LA Lakers?\\u201d, we can imply that the query time is the start time of Kobe Bryant playing for the Lakers. Since only one timestamp is implied in the question, it is a 1-hop question. In contrast, for the question, \\u201cWhat awards did Kobe Bryant win when he was playing for the LA Lakers?\\u201d, both the start time and end time have to be considered. Since Kobe Bryant had a 20-year career with the Lakers, it is a multi-hop question.\\n\\nIn order to have a fair comparison between 1-hop and multi-hop temporal reasoning, we also created a small number of 1-hop questions with the same temporal quintuples and contexts. We denote the timestamp mentioned in the question as the reference time. For L3 questions, we denote the start time of the reference event as the reference time. In order to examine the robustness of temporal reasoning in future years, we only use the questions with a reference time before 2020\\/01\\/01 for training, whereas the development and test sets contain questions both before and after 2020\\/01\\/01.\\nOpen Domain Context Retrieval Previous temporal QA datasets typically rely on a fxed knowledge source. The TimeQA and TempReason datasets use Wikipedia articles as context for open-book QA setting. The StreamingQA dataset uses English news articles from the WMT challenge. TimeQA is a human-annotated dataset based on Wikipedia articles, and temporal facts not refected in Wikipedia are deemed as \\u201cunanswerable\\u201d. However, a single knowledge source may not be suffcient to answer temporal questions, as temporal facts are constantly evolving. To address this limitation, we construct our dataset in an open-domain QA (ODQA) fashion. For the context used in the ODQA setting, we frst include the Wikipedia article on the question subject. We then use the Google Custom Search API with this question as the search query to retrieve the top 10 results. The searched web pages will be scraped by Traflatura (Barbaresi, 2021), a state-of-the-art text extraction tool for NLP research. Due to the anti-scraping mechanism of certain websites, we cannot extract the contexts from all the retrieved web pages. On average, we have 6.7 articles for each question and the average total context length is 93K words. The long context from multiple sources introduces additional challenges for the temporal QA task.\\n\\nHuman Verifcation To ensure that our dataset is of high quality and aligned with the retrieved contexts, we engaged college-educated human annotators to verify the correctness of the QA pairs and retrieved contexts. The annotators are given a temporal QA pair and its corresponding articles, and they are asked to read through the articles and judge whether the QA pair is correct or not. Due to cost limitations, we randomly sample $500\\\\,\\\\mathrm{{QA}}$ pairs from the test set for human verifcation. Among the 500 QA pairs, 100 of them are annotated by two annotators to measure the inter-annotator agreement. The Fleiss Kappa coeffcient of this subset is 0.71, which implies a substantial agreement level. The conficts are resolved by a third annotator. The hourly pay of the annotators is above 22 USD, which is signifcantly higher than the local minimum wage. In the end, 329 QA pairs are deemed as correctly refected in the contexts, we then used these 329 QA pairs as our gold test set in the experiments. We name our dataset ComplexTempReason (Complex-TR). Our detailed dataset statistics are shown in Table 3. The\\u201cPseudo\\u201d column refers to the pseudo-data that we generated in Section 3.1. Besides, we also compare our questions and reasoning types with prior temporal QA datasets in Table 1. We can see that none of the prior datasets included L3 multi-hop temporal reasoning, or questions with time interval $\\\\Delta t$ . Besides, all prior temporal QA datasets contain a considerable number of questions with multiple answers, yet none of them adopted any evaluation metrics for multi-answer questions. We provide a more detailed question comparison of our dataset and prior works in Table 2.\\n\\nTable 3: Statistics of our dataset. Note that we do not include questions after December 2019 in our training set. The Avg. Word Len. row refers to the average number of words in all contexts for the ODQA setting.\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
