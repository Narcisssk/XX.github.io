{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

With increasing demands for high resolutions in modern applications, depth refinement becomes a prerequisite for virtual reality [24, 13], bokeh rendering [27, 28], and image generation [33, 54]. The prevailing methods [25, 21] adopt two-stage tile-based frameworks. Based on the one-stage refined depth of the whole image, they merge high-frequency details by fusing extensive patches with complex patch selection strategies. However, numerous patches lead to heavy computational costs. Besides, as in Fig. 1 (a), excessive integration of local information leads to inconsistent depth structures, e.g., the disrupted billboard.\\nApart from efficiency and consistency, depth refinement [25, 14, 4, 3, 37, 21] is restricted by noisy and blurred depth edges. Highly accurate depth annotations with meticulous boundaries are necessary to enforce fine-grained details. For this reason, prior arts [14, 37, 21] only use synthetic datasets [32,\\n39, 11, 45, 44] for the highly accurate depth values and edges. However, synthetic data falls short of the real world in realism and diversity, causing limited generalizability with blurred depth and degraded performance on in-the-wild scenarios. Some attempts [25, 3] simply adopt naturalscene datasets [35, 47, 49, 5, 20] for the problem. The varying characteristics of real-world depth annotations, e.g., sparsity [2, 5, 7], inaccuracy [35, 36, 55], or blurred edges [48, 47, 43, 10], make them infeasible for supervising refinement models. Thus, GBDF [3] uses depth predictions [51] as pseudo-labels, while Boost [25] leverages adversarial training [6] as guidance. Those inaccurate pseudo-labels and guidance still lead to blurred edges as shown in Fig. 1 (a). The key problem is to alleviate the noise of depth boundaries by constructing accurate edge representations and guidance.\\nTo tackle these challenges, we dig into the underlying reasons for the limitations, instead of the straightforward merging of local details. We model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem, decoupling depth prediction errors into two degradation components: local inconsistency noise and edge deformation noise. We use regional linear transformation perturbation as the local inconsistency noise to measure inconsistent depth structures. The edge deformation noise represents fuzzy boundaries with Gaussian blur. Experiments in Sec. 3.1 showcase that the noises can effectively depict general depth errors, serving as our basic principle to improve refinement results.\\nIn pursuit of the robustness against the local inconsistency noise and edge deformation noise, we propose the Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework, which mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance. A refinement network is considered as the Poisson fusion operator, recovering high-resolution depth from noisy predictions of depth models [51, 30, 1]. Given the noisy input, SDDR can generate low-noise and accurate depth edge representation as pseudo-labels through coarse-to-fine self-distillation. The edge-based guidance including edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss is designed as the optimization objective of Poisson fusion. When depth maps are better refined, the pseudo-labels also become more noise-free. Our approach establishes accurate depth edge representations and guidance, endowing SDDR with strong robustness to the two types of noises. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), SDDR significantly outperforms prior arts [25, 21, 3] in depth accuracy and edge quality. Besides, without merging numerous patches as the two-stage tile-based methods [21, 25], SDDR achieves much higher efficiency.\\nWe conduct extensive experiments on five benchmarks. SDDR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the commonly-used Middlebury2021 [34], Multiscopic [52], and Hypersim [32]. Meanwhile, since SDDR can establish self-distillation with accurate depth edge representation and guidance on natural scenes, the evaluations on in-the-wild DIML [15] and DIODE [40] datasets showcase our superior generalizability. Analytical experiments demonstrate that these noticeable improvements essentially arise from the strong robustness to the noises. Furthermore, the precise depth edge labels produced by SDDR can be directly used to train another model [3] and yield improvements, which indicates that our method could help with training robust refinement models in future works.\\nIn summary, our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 We model the depth refinement task through the noisy Poisson fusion problem with local inconsistency noise and edge deformation noise as two types of depth degradation. \\u2022 We present the robust and efficient Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework, which can generate accurate depth edge representation by the coarse-to-fine self-distillation paradigm. \\u2022 We design the edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss, as the edge-based guidance to enforce the model with both consistent depth structures and meticulous depth edges.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Depth Refinement Models. Depth refinement refines low-resolution depth from depth estimation models [30, 51, 1], predicting high-resolution depth with fine-grained edges and details. Existing methods [3, 14, 21, 25] can be categorized into one-stage [3, 14] and two-stage [25, 21] frameworks. One-stage methods [3, 14] conduct global refinement of the whole image, which could produce blurred depth edges and details. To further enhance local details, based on the globally refined results, the prevailing refinement approaches [25, 21] adopt the two-stage tile-based manner by selecting and merging numerous patches. For example, Boost [25] proposes a complex patch-sampling strategy based on the gradients of input images. PatchFusion [21] improves the sampling by shifted and tidily arranged tile placement. However, the massive patches lead to low efficiency. The excessive local information produces inconsistent depth structures or even artifacts. In this paper, we propose the Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework, which can predict both consistent structures and accurate details with much higher efficiency by tackling the noisy Poisson fusion problem.\\nDepth Refinement Datasets. Depth datasets with highly accurate annotations and edges are necessary for refinement models. Prior arts [21, 14] utilize CG-rendered datasets [45, 44, 39, 11, 32] for accurate depth, but the realism and diversity fail to match the real world. For instance, neither the UnrealStereo4K [39] nor the MVS-Synth [11] contain people, restricting the generalizability of refinement models. A simple idea for the problem is to leverage natural-scene data [35, 47, 49, 5, 20]. However, different annotation methods lead to varying characteristics, e.g., sparsity of LiDAR [2, 5, 7], inaccurate depth of structured light [55, 35, 36], and blurred edges of stereo matching [49, 47, 43]. To address the challenge, Boost [25] adopts adversarial training as guidance only with a small amount of accurately annotated real-world images. GBDF [3] employs depth predictions [51] with guided filtering [9] as pseudo-labels. Due to the inaccurate pseudo-labels and guidance, they [3, 25] produce blurred edges and details. By contrast, SDDR constructs accurate depth edge representation and edge-based guidance for self-distillation, leading to fine-grained details and strong generalizability.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 SDDR: Self-Distilled Depth Refinement\",\"section_content\":\"We present a detailed illustration of our Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework.

SDDR mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance, which will be described in Sec. 3.2 and Sec. 3.3 respectively.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Noisy Poisson Fusion\",\"section_content\":\"Problem Statement. Based on depth maps of depth prediction models, i.e., depth predictor $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{d}$ , depth refinement recovers high-resolution depth with accurate edges and details by refinement network $\\\\mathcal{N}_{r}$ . Some attempts in image super-resolution [31, 56, 26] and multi-modal integration [19, 17, 18, 53] utilize Poisson fusion to merge features and restore details. Motivated by this, we propose to model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem. The ideal depth $D^{*}$ with completely accurate depth values and precise depth edges are unobtainable in real world. A general depth prediction $D$ , whether produced by $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{d}$ or $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ for an input image $I$ , can be expressed as a noisy approximation of $D^{*}$ :\\n$\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{cons}}$ and $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{edge}}$ denote local inconsistency and edge deformation noise to decouple depth prediction errors. Local inconsistency noise $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{cons}}$ represents inconsistent depth structures through regional linear transformation perturbation. Based on masked Gaussian blur, edge deformation noise $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{edge}}$ showcases degradation and blurring of depth edges. Refer to Appendix A.4 for details of the noises. As in Fig. 2, depth errors can be depicted by combinations of $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{cons}}$ and $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{edge}}$ . Thus, considering refinement network $\\\\mathcal{N}_{r}$ as a Poisson fusion operator, depth refinement can be defined as a noisy Poisson fusion problem:\\n\\nThe refined depth of $\\\\mathcal{N}_{r}$ is denoted as $D_{0}$ . $\\\\nabla$ refers to the gradient operator. Typically for depth refinement [3, 25, 21] task, input image $I$ is resized to low-resolution $L$ and high-resolution $H$ for $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{d}$ . $\\\\Omega$ represents high-frequency areas, while $I-\\\\Omega$ showcases low-frequency regions.\\nMotivation Elaboration. In practice, due to the inaccessibility of truly ideal depth, approximation of $D^{*}$ is required for training $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ . For this reason, the optimization objective in Eq. 2 is divided into $\\\\Omega$ and $I-\\\\Omega$ . For the low-frequency $I-\\\\Omega$ , $D^{*}$ can be simply represented by the ground truth $D_{g t}^{*}$ of training data. However, as illustrated in Sec. 2, depth annotations inevitably suffer from imperfect edge quality for the high-frequency $\\\\Omega$ . It is essential to generate accurate approximations of ideal depth boundaries as training labels, which are robust to $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{cons}}$ and $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{edge}}$ . Some prior arts adopts synthetic depth [39, 11, 32] for higher edge quality, while leading to limited generalization capability with blurred predictions in real-world scenes. To leverage real depth data [35, 47, 46, 49, 5, 20], GBDF [3] employs depth predictions [51] with guided filter as pseudo-labels, which still contain significant noises and result in blurred depth. Besides, optimization of $\\\\Omega$ is also ignored. Kim et al. [14] relies on manually annotated $\\\\Omega$ regions as input. GBDF [3, 30, 29] omits the selection of $\\\\Omega$ and supervises depth gradients on the whole image. Inaccurate approximations of $\\\\nabla D^{*}$ and inappropriate division of $\\\\Omega$ lead to limited robustness to local inconsistency noise and edge deformation noise.\\nMethod Overview. To address the challenges, as shown in Fig. 3, we propose our SDDR framework with two main components: depth edge representation and edge-based guidance. To achieve lownoise approximations of $\\\\nabla D^{*}$ , we construct the depth edge representation $G_{s}$ through coarse-to-fine self-distillation, where $s\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\cdots,S\\\\}$ refers to iteration numbers. The input image is divided into several windows with overlaps from coarse to fine. For instance, we denote the high-frequency area of a certain window $w$ in iteration $s$ as $\\\\Omega_{s}^{w}$ , and the refined depth of $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ as $D_{s}^{w}$ . In this way, the self-distilled optimization of depth edge representation $G_{s}$ can be expressed as follows:\\nDuring training, depth edge representation $G_{s}^{w}$ is further optimized based on the gradient of current refined depth $D_{s}^{w}$ . The final edge representation $G_{S}$ of the whole image will be utilized as the pseudolabel to supervise the refinement network $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ after $S$ iterations. SDDR can generate low-noise and robust edge representation, mitigating the impact of $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{cons}}$ and $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{edge}}$ (More results in Appendix A.1).\\nWith $G_{S}$ as the training label, the next is to enforce $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ with robustness to the noises, achieving consistent structures and meticulous boundaries. To optimize $\\\\mathcal{N}_{r}$ , we propose edge-based guidance as an equivalent optimization objective to noisy Poisson fusion problem, which is presented by:\\nFor the second term of $I-\\\\Omega$ , we adopt depth annotations $D_{g t}^{*}$ as the approximation of $D^{*}$ . For the first term, with the generated $G_{S}$ as pseudo-labels of $\\\\nabla D^{*}$ , we propose edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss to optimize $D_{0}$ and $\\\\Omega$ predicted by $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ . The edge-guided gradient loss supervises the model to consistently refine depth edges with local scale and shift alignment. The edge-based fusion loss guides $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ to adaptively fuse low- and high-frequency features based on the learned soft region mask $\\\\Omega$ , achieving balanced consistency and details by quantile sampling.\\nOverall, when depth maps are better refined under the edge-based guidance, the edge representation also becomes more accurate and noise-free with the carefully designed coarse-to-fine manner. The self-distillation paradigm can be naturally conducted based on the noisy Poisson fusion, enforcing our model with strong robustness against the local inconsistency noise and edge deformation noise.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Depth Edge Representation\",\"section_content\":\"To build the self-distilled training paradigm, the prerequisite is to construct accurate and lownoise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels. Meticulous steps are designed to generate the representations with both consistent structures and accurate details.\\nInitial Depth Edge Representation. We generate an initial depth edge representation based on the global refinement results of the whole image. For the input image $I$ , we obtain the refined depth results $D_{0}$ from $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ as in Eq. 2. Depth gradient $G_{0}=\\\\nabla D_{0}$ is calculated as the initial representation. An edge-preserving filter [38] is applied on $G_{0}$ to reduce noises in low-frequency area $I-\\\\Omega$ . With global information of the whole image, $G_{0}$ can preserve spatial structures and depth consistency. It also incorporates certain detailed information from the high-resolution input $H$ . To enhance edges and details in high-frequency region $\\\\Omega$ , we conduct coarse-to-fine edge refinement in the next step.\\nCoarse-to-fine Edge Refinement. The initial $D_{0}$ is then refined from course to fine with $S$ iterations to generate final depth edge representation.

At last, after $S$ iterations, we can obtain the pseudo-label $G_{S}$ as the final depth edge representation for self-distillation. For better understanding, we showcase visualization of $D_{0},D_{S}$ , and $G_{S}$ in Fig. 4.\\nRobustness to Noises.

In Sec. 3.1, we introduce the noisy Poisson fusion to model the depth refinement task and provide an overview to outline our approach. SDDR mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance, which will be described in Sec. 3.2 and Sec. 3.3 respectively.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Depth Edge Representation\",\"section_content\":\"To build the self-distilled training paradigm, the prerequisite is to construct accurate and lownoise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels. Meticulous steps are designed to generate the representations with both consistent structures and accurate details.\\nInitial Depth Edge Representation. We generate an initial depth edge representation based on the global refinement results of the whole image. For the input image $I$ , we obtain the refined depth results $D_{0}$ from $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ as in Eq. 2. Depth gradient $G_{0}=\\\\nabla D_{0}$ is calculated as the initial representation. An edge-preserving filter [38] is applied on $G_{0}$ to reduce noises in low-frequency area $I-\\\\Omega$ . With global information of the whole image, $G_{0}$ can preserve spatial structures and depth consistency. It also incorporates certain detailed information from the high-resolution input $H$ . To enhance edges and details in high-frequency region $\\\\Omega$ , we conduct coarse-to-fine edge refinement in the next step.\\nCoarse-to-fine Edge Refinement. The initial $D_{0}$ is then refined from course to fine with $S$ iterations to generate final depth edge representation. For a specific iteration $s\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\cdots,S\\\\}$ , we uniformly divide input image $I$ into $\\\\left(s+1\\\\right)^{2}$ windows with overlaps. We denote a certain window $w$ in iteration $s$ of the input image $I$ as $I_{s}^{w}$ . The high-resolution $H_{s}^{w}$ is then fed to the depth predictor $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{d}$ . $D_{s-1}^{w}$ represents the depth refinement results of the corresponding window $w$ in the previous iteration $s-1$ The refined depth $D_{s}^{w}$ of window $w$ in current iteration $s$ as Eq. 3 can be obtained by $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{d}$ and $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ :\\nAfter that, depth gradient $\\\\nabla D_{s}^{w}$ is used to update the depth edge representation.

At last, after $S$ iterations, we can obtain the pseudo-label $G_{S}$ as the final depth edge representation for self-distillation. For better understanding, we showcase visualization of $D_{0},D_{S}$ , and $G_{S}$ in Fig. 4.\\nRobustness to Noises.

Meanwhile, coarse-to-fine window partitioning and scale alignment mitigate $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{cons}}$ and bring consistency. Thus, $G_{S}$ exhibits strong robustness to the two types of noises by self-distillation.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.3 Edge-based Guidance\",\"section_content\":\"With depth edge representation $G_{S}$ as pseudo-label for self-distillation, we propose the edge-based guidance including edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss to supervise $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ .\\nEdge-guided Gradient Loss. We aim for fine-grained depth by one-stage refinement, while the two-stage coarse-to-fine manner can further improve the results. Thus, edge-guided gradient loss instructs the initial $D_{0}$ with the accurate $G_{S}$ . Some problems need to be tackled for this purpose.\\nAs $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ has not converged in the early training phase, $G_{S}$ is not sufficiently reliable with inconsistent scales and high-level noises between local areas. Therefore, we extract several non-overlapping regions $P_{n},\\\\stackrel{\\\\cdot}{n\\\\in}\\\\left\\\\{1,2,\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot,N_{g}\\\\right\\\\}$ with high gradient density by clustering [8], where $N_{g}$ represents the number of clustering centroids. The edge-guided gradient loss is only calculated inside $P_{n}$ with scale and shift alignment. By doing so, the model can focus on improving details in high-frequency regions and preserving depth structures in flat areas. The training process can also be more stable. The edge-guided gradient loss can be calculated by:\\nwhere $\\\\beta_{1}$ and $\\\\beta_{0}$ are the scale and shift coefficients similar to Eq. 6. We use $[\\\\cdot]$ to depict mask fetching operations, i.e., extracting local area $P_{n}$ from $G_{0}$ and $G_{S}$ . With the edge-guided gradient loss, SDDR predicts refined depth with meticulous edges and consistent structures.\\nEdge-based Fusion Loss. High-resolution feature $F_{H}$ extracted from $H$ brings finer details but could lead to inconsistency, while the low-resolution feature $F_{L}$ from $L$ can better maintain depth structures. $\\\\mathcal{N}_{r}$ should primarily rely on $F_{L}$ for consistent spatial structures within low-frequency $I-\\\\Omega$ , while it should preferentially fuse $F_{H}$ for edges and details in high-frequency areas $\\\\Omega$ . The fusion of $F_{L}$ and $F_{H}$ noticeably influence the refined depth. However, prior arts [14, 3, 25] adopt manually-annotated $\\\\Omega$ regions as fixed masks or even omit $\\\\Omega$ as the whole image, leading to inconsistency and blurring. To this end, we implement $\\\\Omega$ as a learnable soft mask, with quantile sampling strategy to guide the adaptive fusion of $F_{L}$ and $F_{H}$ . The fusion process is expressed by:\\nwhere $\\\\odot$ refers to the Hadamard product. $\\\\Omega$ is the learnable mask ranging from zero to one. Larger values in $\\\\Omega$ showcases higher frequency with denser edges, requiring more detailed information from the high-resolution feature $F_{H}$ . Thus, $\\\\Omega$ can naturally serve as the fusion weight of $F_{L}$ and $F_{H}$ .\\nTo be specific, we denote the lower quantile of $G_{S}$ as $t_{a}$ , i.e., $P(X<t_{a}|X\\\\in G_{S})=a$ . $\\\\{G_{S}<t_{a}\\\\}$ indicates flat areas with low gradient magnitude, while $\\\\{G_{S}>t_{1-a}\\\\}$ represents high-frequency regions. $\\\\Omega$ should be larger in those high-frequency areas $\\\\{G_{S}>t_{1-a}\\\\}$ and smaller in the flat regions $\\\\{G_{S}<t_{a}\\\\}$ . This suggests that $G_{S}$ and $\\\\Omega$ should be synchronized with similar data distribution. Thus, if we define the lower quantile of $\\\\Omega$ as $T_{a}$ , i.e., ${\\\\dot{P}}(X<T_{a}|X\\\\in\\\\Omega)=a$ , an arbitrary pixel $i\\\\in\\\\{G_{S}<t_{a}\\\\}$ in flat regions should also belong to $\\\\{\\\\Omega<T_{a}\\\\}$ with a lower weight for $F_{H}$ , while the pixel $i\\\\in\\\\{G_{S}>t_{1-a}\\\\}$ in high-frequency areas should be contained in $\\\\{\\\\Omega>T_{1-a}\\\\}$ for more detailed information. The edge-based fusion loss can be depicted as follows:\\n\\nwhere $N_{p}$ is the pixel number. We supervise the distribution of $\\\\Omega$ with lower quantiles $T_{n*a}$ and $T_{1-n*a},\\\\overset{\\\\cdot}{n}\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\cdots,N_{w}\\\\}$ . Therefore, pixels with larger deviations between $G_{S}$ and $\\\\Omega$ will be penalized more heavily. Taking the worst case as an example, if $i~\\\\in~\\\\{G_{S}~<~t_{N_{w}*a}\\\\}$ but $i\\\\in\\\\{\\\\Omega<T_{N_{w}\\\\ast a}\\\\}$ , the error for the pixel will be accumulated for $N_{w}$ times from $a$ to $N_{w}*a$ . $\\\\mathcal{L}_{f u s i o n}$ enforces SDDR with consistent structures (low $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{cons}}$ noise) in $I-\\\\Omega$ and accurate edges (low $\\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{edge}}$ noise) in $\\\\Omega$ . The visualizations of quantile-sampled $G_{S}$ and $\\\\Omega$ are presented in Fig. 4.\\nFinally, combining $\\\\mathcal{L}_{g r a d}$ and $\\\\mathcal{L}_{f u s i o n}$ as edge-based guidance for self-distillation, the overall loss $\\\\mathcal{L}$ for training $\\\\textstyle{\\\\mathcal{N}}_{r}$ is calculated as Eq. 10. $\\\\mathcal{L}_{g t}$ supervises the discrepancy between $D_{0}$ and ground truth $D_{g t}^{*}$ with affinity-invariant loss [30, 29].
