{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The shared task comprises two subtasks: identifying new senses that words gain with time (when comparing newer and older time periods) and producing the defnitions for the identifed new senses. We implemented a conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive solution to both subtasks. We trained adapter-based binary classifcation models to match glosses with usage examples and leveraged the probability output of the models to identify novel senses. The same models were used to match examples of novel sense usages with Wiktionary defnitions. Our submission attained third place on the frst subtask and the frst place on the second subtask.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"The subject of the AXOLOTL-24 shared task (Fedorova et al., 2024) is diachronic semantic change detection and explanation. Diachronic semantic change is understood as the change in word meanings (i.e., words losing old senses and obtaining new ones) over shorter or longer periods. Accordingly, given a dataset containing usage examples from different periods (old and new), the task is to identify and defne the new senses that words gain in the new time period compared to the old one.\\nThe goal of the shared task is to implement a semantic change modeling system for two tasks:\\n1) Correctly assigning existing senses to target word usages and identifying novel, previously unseen senses; 2) Describing the identifed novel senses.\\nThe data in the shared task is provided in three languages: Finnish, Russian, and German (the surprise language for which only the test split is available). For each language, examples from old and new periods are given. Each data point consists of a target word and its usage example, gloss (target word defnition), the period the example comes from, and usage and sense IDs. The data includes glosses for both time periods in the training and validation splits, while glosses for the new time period are not provided in the test splits. The \\u201cold\\u201d and \\u201cnew\\u201d periods differ for each language. For Finnish, old texts are dated before 1700, and new ones are dated after 1700. For Russian, the old target word usages are from the 19th century, and the new data represents modern usages of words. For German, the old period is from 1800 to 1899, and the new period is from 1946 to 1990 (Schlechtweg, 2023).\\n\\nAlthough we participated in both subtasks, we were primarily interested in the second subtask of producing defnitions for new senses. We implemented a solution that matches identifed novel sense usages with defnitions from an external resource (Wiktionary). Our approach is based on a binary classifcation task to predict whether a proposed defnition matches the sense under consideration. We reused this binary classifcation model for the second subtask of describing the identifed novel senses.\\n\\nOur system attained the frst place on the second subtask (Table 2) and obtained competitive results on the frst subtask (Table 1).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Methodology\",\"section_content\":\"We propose a simple classifcation-based solution for both subtasks. We adopt the GlossBERT approach (Huang et al., 2019) that treats word sense disambiguation as a sentence pair classifcation task, where each pair comprises a usage example and a sense defnition. In turn, we frame the problem of new sense identifcation as the problem of matching between usage examples and sense definitions. Accordingly, the matching problem can be solved with a binary classifcation model that, given a usage example and a sense defnition, outputs the probability of the sense defnition correctly describing the usage example.\\nWe adopt the cross-encoder model that simultaneously processes the usage examples and the sense defnitions with the same model. Given a usage example and a sense inventory, we apply the classifcation model to predict binary probabilities for each example\\/sense defnition combination. If the highest probability over all candidate pairs exceeds a predefned threshold, the system assigns the highest probability sense to the usage example. Otherwise, the sense used in the example is deemed to be new.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.1 Subtask 1: Bridging Diachronic Word Uses and a Synchronic Dictionary\",\"section_content\":\"This subtask aims to assign a sense ID to every usage example from the new period; the sense ID may come either from the senses in the old period or, if the system identifes a novel sense, a unique new sense ID is created.\\nThe data for the frst subtask contains sense definitions and correct usages, which can be used to construct positive examples for our task formulation. However, having only positive examples for a classifcation model is generally insuffcient. To produce negative examples, we employ a simple algorithm. We only consider words associated with at least two distinct sense IDs. For a given sense ID and its associated gloss, we create all possible combinations of the gloss with the usage examples associated with the other sense IDs of the same word (consult Appendix A for additional details).\\nWe expect that the negatives obtained with this algorithm are hard and, as such, are more useful for training that could be obtained, for instance, via random sampling.\\nWe transform every split of every language by extending it with negative examples created with the procedure described above. For each language, we train a separate classifcation model on the train split and evaluate on the development split. When training and evaluating the classifer, we do not consider the period (old or new) from which the examples come. The best checkpoint for each model is selected based on the development F1 score.\\nHaving trained the classifcation models, we perform inference on the test set and transform the output into the expected format. During inference, the usage examples from the old period are ignored and the classifcation is performed only on pairs of usage examples from the new period and sense defnitions from the old period. If the highest predicted probability for a usage example is above a threshold, we assign the sense ID of the most probable sense defnition to the usage example. Otherwise, a new sense ID is created. The fnal result submitted for evaluation contains both the predicted senses for the examples from the new period as well as the positive examples in the test split from the old period.\\nFor the surprise language\\u2014German\\u2014the training process is slightly different. No training or validation data is provided, so we train and validate the classifcation model on the positive and negative examples obtained from the old period in the test data. Inference, however, is exactly the same.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 Subtask 2: Defnition Generation for Novel Word Senses\",\"section_content\":\"Subtask 2 aims to defne each novel sense identifed in the frst subtask. Despite the name of the subtask, our approach does not generate any new defnitions. We also do not train any additional models. As previously mentioned, we consider this task a matching problem, except that the defnitions for the novel senses are not present in the data provided in the shared task. To solve this problem, we scrape the defnitions of the surface forms, for which we identifed at least one example as the usage of a novel sense, from the Wiktionary. More specifcally, we scrape the defnitions from the language-specifc Wiktionary versions for each language (i.e. Finnish,2 Russian,3 and German4 Wiktionaries).\\n\\nHaving scraped the necessary defnitions, we head straight to inference on the test set. We reuse the models and predictions from the frst subtask. We collect the examples identifed as the usages of the novel senses from the predictions and match them with the Wiktionary defnitions using the classifer models trained in the frst subtask. After that, we add the matched defnitions to the predicted new senses.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.3 Implementation Details\",\"section_content\":\"Different from GlossBERT (Huang et al., 2019), which is based on the BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) model, we instead use XLM-RoBERTa (Conneau et al., 2020) as the base model for our classifers. XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual model that includes Finnish, Russian, and German in its training data. We expect our system to beneft from the multilinguality. Instead of full fne-tuning, we opt for parameter-effcient fne-tuning. More specifcally, we train bottleneck adapter (Houlsby et al., 2019) classifers for each language. We adopted this approach because it makes our solution computationally lightweight and easily reproducible.\\nIn GlossBERT, Huang et al. (2019) differentiate between training setups with and without weak supervision, with the former including the defned word itself in the gloss, as well as highlighting it in the usage example. According to the experimental results reported by Huang et al. (2019), weak supervision appears to bring minor improvements in sense prediction. However, we do not use weak supervision in our submission. The reason is that Finnish and Russian are substantially more morphologically rich languages than English; thus, the target words rarely appear in their dictionary forms in the usage examples. Moreover, in some cases, the orthography also differs between old and new periods.\\nTo delimit context and gloss, Huang et al. (2019) use the special [SEP] token that is pre-trained into the BERT model via the next sentence prediction task. However, RoBERTa (Zhuang et al., 2021), and by extension XLM-RoBERTa, omitted the next sentence prediction task in the pre-training. As a result of that, the $<\\\\!\\/\\\\mathrm{s}\\\\!>$ token that is used by\\nRoBERTa in place of [SEP] does not have the same classifcation-oriented meaning. For this reason, we employed the tabulation symbol as the delimiter instead.\\nFor each language, we employed different variations of the base model and varying training setups. For Finnish, we used the large version of XLM-RoBERTa and trained for ten epochs in halfprecision with a batch size of 128 and 3 steps of gradient accumulation. We observed that the training did not converge with a smaller effective batch size. For Russian, we trained the classifer adapter with the base version of XLM-RoBERTa for 50 epochs with a batch size of 144. We also experimented with the large version of the model for the Russian language; however, it showed no improvements compared to the base version. For German, we did not train the classifer from scratch. Instead, we continued training from the best checkpoint trained on the Finnish data. The motivation is that there is considerably more data in Finnish than in Russian in the shared task, so we assume the Finnish model to be stronger. We continued training the Finnish classifer for 20 epochs in half-precision with a batch size of 48 and 6 steps of gradient accumulation. All models were trained with a 5e-4 learning rate.\\nThe threshold value for the classifer\\u2019s probability to identify novel senses was selected as the highest scoring option in the frst subtask using the evaluation script provided by the organizers. We tested a small number of values in the range of of 0.2 to 0.5 on Russian and determined the best value to be 0.35. The same value was used for all languages without additional testing due to time limitations.\\nThe models were trained on the University HighPerformance Cluster (University of Tartu, 2018). We used a single Tesla V100 GPU for Russian and German, while for Finnish, we used a single A100 80GB GPU. The time elapsed on training is 9 hours for Finnish, 3 hours for Russian, and 9 minutes for German. We implemented our solution using the transformers5 and the adapters6 libraries. The source code and the data are available on GitHub7 and HuggingFace Hub,8 respectively.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Results\",\"section_content\":\"The overall results of both subtasks are presented in Tables 1 and 2. For subtask 1, the metrics reported are the average macro-F1 score and the average Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) (Hubert and Arabie, 1985) across target words per language. The overall F1 and ARI scores are computed as the mean across all languages. For subtask 2, the evaluation metrics are the BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) averaged across target words per language. BLEU and BERTScore values for the entire subtask are the respective averages across all languages. The overall score is the mean of BLEU and BERTScore.\\nOur submission attained the third place out of eight participants in the frst subtask and the frst place out of four participants in the second subtask (Table 2). This aligns with our expectations since we focused on the second subtask from the beginning and applied the system developed for the second subtask to the frst subtask. When looking at the language-specifc measures of subtask 2 (Table 3), one can see considerable differences between languages. Our system works the best in Russian while also performing well in German in terms of BERTScore (although the BLEU score is close to 0 for all systems). In Finnish, our system is competitive in terms of BERTScore but underperforms compared to the baseline in terms of BLEU.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Discussion\",\"section_content\":\"Our submission to the second subtask is well ahead of the other participants in the overall leaderboard (Table 2) despite the simplicity of our approach. However, the language-specifc results show that it is not so clear-cut (Table 3). Some of the success can be attributed to accidentally matching the source of defnitions for the Russian language, which is the Russian Wiktionary. We believe so because the value of the BLEU metric of our submission in the Russian language is higher than that of the other teams and in the other languages by an order of magnitude. However, we do not consider this a critical issue because the BERTScore metric is reasonably high and well above the baseline for all languages, suggesting that the matched defnitions capture the expected senses well. However, the corresponding low BLEU scores highlight the inadequacy of the BLEU metric for this task.\\n\\nSecondly, our approach to the second subtask has limitations. More specifcally, matching usage examples only against the defnitions of the target word, while effcient, considerably limits the system\\u2019s ability to describe completely new senses. Intuitively, a defnition associated with a different word may be a more suitable description of a new sense. A more robust solution would involve matching usage examples against all available defnitions. However, that would likely require using a bi-encoder architecture (as proposed by Blevins and Zettlemoyer (2020), for instance) instead of a cross-encoder due to the computational complexity of matching every example with every defnition.\\nAccessing the defnitions for all the words in a given language-specifc Wiktionary is timeconsuming because the layout, article structure, and templates used are completely different for each Wiktionary version. While there is a resource providing Wiktionary dumps in a much more convenient format,9 it is mostly limited in its support to the English language, with the support for some languages, such as Russian and German, being work in progress, and for others, such as Finnish, completely missing at the time of writing. Moreover, the Finnish, German, and Russian Wiktionaries differ in size and the fullness of their coverage. A rough estimate can be made by accessing the Special:Statistics page of each Wiktionary and examining the total number of unique pages (Table 4).\\nWe note the correlation between the smaller sizes of the Finnish and German Wiktionaries and the lower performance of our system on these languages.\\nLastly, although we did not focus on the frst subtask, we believe the results of the sense prediction task obtained with our systems could also be improved. For instance, the choice of the threshold value for determining a new sense could be done in a more systematic manner or made learnable. Similarly, adjusting the training data or the hyperparameters might bring further improvements.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"This paper described our solution to both subtasks of the AXOLOTL-24 shared task based on leveraging classifer probabilities for usage example\\/sense defnition pairs.

The shared task comprises two subtasks: identifying new senses that words gain with time (when comparing newer and older time periods) and producing the defnitions for the identifed new senses. We implemented a conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive solution to both subtasks. We trained adapter-based binary classifcation models to match glosses with usage examples and leveraged the probability output of the models to identify novel senses. The same models were used to match examples of novel sense usages with Wiktionary defnitions. Our submission attained third place on the frst subtask and the frst place on the second subtask.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The subject of the AXOLOTL-24 shared task (Fedorova et al., 2024) is diachronic semantic change detection and explanation. Diachronic semantic change is understood as the change in word meanings (i.e., words losing old senses and obtaining new ones) over shorter or longer periods. Accordingly, given a dataset containing usage examples from different periods (old and new), the task is to identify and defne the new senses that words gain in the new time period compared to the old one.\\nThe goal of the shared task is to implement a semantic change modeling system for two tasks:\\n1) Correctly assigning existing senses to target word usages and identifying novel, previously unseen senses; 2) Describing the identifed novel senses.\\nThe data in the shared task is provided in three languages: Finnish, Russian, and German (the surprise language for which only the test split is available). For each language, examples from old and new periods are given. Each data point consists of a target word and its usage example, gloss (target word defnition), the period the example comes from, and usage and sense IDs. The data includes glosses for both time periods in the training and validation splits, while glosses for the new time period are not provided in the test splits. The \\u201cold\\u201d and \\u201cnew\\u201d periods differ for each language. For Finnish, old texts are dated before 1700, and new ones are dated after 1700. For Russian, the old target word usages are from the 19th century, and the new data represents modern usages of words. For German, the old period is from 1800 to 1899, and the new period is from 1946 to 1990 (Schlechtweg, 2023).\\n\\nAlthough we participated in both subtasks, we were primarily interested in the second subtask of producing defnitions for new senses. We implemented a solution that matches identifed novel sense usages with defnitions from an external resource (Wiktionary). Our approach is based on a binary classifcation task to predict whether a proposed defnition matches the sense under consideration. We reused this binary classifcation model for the second subtask of describing the identifed novel senses.\\n\\nOur system attained the frst place on the second subtask (Table 2) and obtained competitive results on the frst subtask (Table 1).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We propose a simple classifcation-based solution for both subtasks. We adopt the GlossBERT approach (Huang et al., 2019) that treats word sense disambiguation as a sentence pair classifcation task, where each pair comprises a usage example and a sense defnition. In turn, we frame the problem of new sense identifcation as the problem of matching between usage examples and sense definitions. Accordingly, the matching problem can be solved with a binary classifcation model that, given a usage example and a sense defnition, outputs the probability of the sense defnition correctly describing the usage example.\\nWe adopt the cross-encoder model that simultaneously processes the usage examples and the sense defnitions with the same model. Given a usage example and a sense inventory, we apply the classifcation model to predict binary probabilities for each example\\/sense defnition combination. If the highest probability over all candidate pairs exceeds a predefned threshold, the system assigns the highest probability sense to the usage example. Otherwise, the sense used in the example is deemed to be new.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"This subtask aims to assign a sense ID to every usage example from the new period; the sense ID may come either from the senses in the old period or, if the system identifes a novel sense, a unique new sense ID is created.\\nThe data for the frst subtask contains sense definitions and correct usages, which can be used to construct positive examples for our task formulation. However, having only positive examples for a classifcation model is generally insuffcient. To produce negative examples, we employ a simple algorithm. We only consider words associated with at least two distinct sense IDs. For a given sense ID and its associated gloss, we create all possible combinations of the gloss with the usage examples associated with the other sense IDs of the same word (consult Appendix A for additional details).\\nWe expect that the negatives obtained with this algorithm are hard and, as such, are more useful for training that could be obtained, for instance, via random sampling.\\nWe transform every split of every language by extending it with negative examples created with the procedure described above. For each language, we train a separate classifcation model on the train split and evaluate on the development split. When training and evaluating the classifer, we do not consider the period (old or new) from which the examples come. The best checkpoint for each model is selected based on the development F1 score.\\nHaving trained the classifcation models, we perform inference on the test set and transform the output into the expected format. During inference, the usage examples from the old period are ignored and the classifcation is performed only on pairs of usage examples from the new period and sense defnitions from the old period. If the highest predicted probability for a usage example is above a threshold, we assign the sense ID of the most probable sense defnition to the usage example. Otherwise, a new sense ID is created. The fnal result submitted for evaluation contains both the predicted senses for the examples from the new period as well as the positive examples in the test split from the old period.\\nFor the surprise language\\u2014German\\u2014the training process is slightly different. No training or validation data is provided, so we train and validate the classifcation model on the positive and negative examples obtained from the old period in the test data. Inference, however, is exactly the same.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Subtask 2 aims to defne each novel sense identifed in the frst subtask. Despite the name of the subtask, our approach does not generate any new defnitions. We also do not train any additional models. As previously mentioned, we consider this task a matching problem, except that the defnitions for the novel senses are not present in the data provided in the shared task. To solve this problem, we scrape the defnitions of the surface forms, for which we identifed at least one example as the usage of a novel sense, from the Wiktionary. More specifcally, we scrape the defnitions from the language-specifc Wiktionary versions for each language (i.e. Finnish,2 Russian,3 and German4 Wiktionaries).\\n\\nHaving scraped the necessary defnitions, we head straight to inference on the test set. We reuse the models and predictions from the frst subtask. We collect the examples identifed as the usages of the novel senses from the predictions and match them with the Wiktionary defnitions using the classifer models trained in the frst subtask. After that, we add the matched defnitions to the predicted new senses.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Different from GlossBERT (Huang et al., 2019), which is based on the BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) model, we instead use XLM-RoBERTa (Conneau et al., 2020) as the base model for our classifers. XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual model that includes Finnish, Russian, and German in its training data. We expect our system to beneft from the multilinguality. Instead of full fne-tuning, we opt for parameter-effcient fne-tuning. More specifcally, we train bottleneck adapter (Houlsby et al., 2019) classifers for each language. We adopted this approach because it makes our solution computationally lightweight and easily reproducible.\\nIn GlossBERT, Huang et al. (2019) differentiate between training setups with and without weak supervision, with the former including the defned word itself in the gloss, as well as highlighting it in the usage example. According to the experimental results reported by Huang et al. (2019), weak supervision appears to bring minor improvements in sense prediction. However, we do not use weak supervision in our submission. The reason is that Finnish and Russian are substantially more morphologically rich languages than English; thus, the target words rarely appear in their dictionary forms in the usage examples. Moreover, in some cases, the orthography also differs between old and new periods.\\nTo delimit context and gloss, Huang et al. (2019) use the special [SEP] token that is pre-trained into the BERT model via the next sentence prediction task. However, RoBERTa (Zhuang et al., 2021), and by extension XLM-RoBERTa, omitted the next sentence prediction task in the pre-training. As a result of that, the $<\\\\!\\/\\\\mathrm{s}\\\\!>$ token that is used by\\nRoBERTa in place of [SEP] does not have the same classifcation-oriented meaning. For this reason, we employed the tabulation symbol as the delimiter instead.\\nFor each language, we employed different variations of the base model and varying training setups. For Finnish, we used the large version of XLM-RoBERTa and trained for ten epochs in halfprecision with a batch size of 128 and 3 steps of gradient accumulation. We observed that the training did not converge with a smaller effective batch size. For Russian, we trained the classifer adapter with the base version of XLM-RoBERTa for 50 epochs with a batch size of 144. We also experimented with the large version of the model for the Russian language; however, it showed no improvements compared to the base version. For German, we did not train the classifer from scratch. Instead, we continued training from the best checkpoint trained on the Finnish data. The motivation is that there is considerably more data in Finnish than in Russian in the shared task, so we assume the Finnish model to be stronger. We continued training the Finnish classifer for 20 epochs in half-precision with a batch size of 48 and 6 steps of gradient accumulation. All models were trained with a 5e-4 learning rate.\\nThe threshold value for the classifer\\u2019s probability to identify novel senses was selected as the highest scoring option in the frst subtask using the evaluation script provided by the organizers. We tested a small number of values in the range of of 0.2 to 0.5 on Russian and determined the best value to be 0.35. The same value was used for all languages without additional testing due to time limitations.\\nThe models were trained on the University HighPerformance Cluster (University of Tartu, 2018). We used a single Tesla V100 GPU for Russian and German, while for Finnish, we used a single A100 80GB GPU. The time elapsed on training is 9 hours for Finnish, 3 hours for Russian, and 9 minutes for German. We implemented our solution using the transformers5 and the adapters6 libraries. The source code and the data are available on GitHub7 and HuggingFace Hub,8 respectively.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The overall results of both subtasks are presented in Tables 1 and 2. For subtask 1, the metrics reported are the average macro-F1 score and the average Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) (Hubert and Arabie, 1985) across target words per language. The overall F1 and ARI scores are computed as the mean across all languages. For subtask 2, the evaluation metrics are the BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) averaged across target words per language. BLEU and BERTScore values for the entire subtask are the respective averages across all languages. The overall score is the mean of BLEU and BERTScore.\\nOur submission attained the third place out of eight participants in the frst subtask and the frst place out of four participants in the second subtask (Table 2). This aligns with our expectations since we focused on the second subtask from the beginning and applied the system developed for the second subtask to the frst subtask. When looking at the language-specifc measures of subtask 2 (Table 3), one can see considerable differences between languages. Our system works the best in Russian while also performing well in German in terms of BERTScore (although the BLEU score is close to 0 for all systems). In Finnish, our system is competitive in terms of BERTScore but underperforms compared to the baseline in terms of BLEU.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Our submission to the second subtask is well ahead of the other participants in the overall leaderboard (Table 2) despite the simplicity of our approach. However, the language-specifc results show that it is not so clear-cut (Table 3). Some of the success can be attributed to accidentally matching the source of defnitions for the Russian language, which is the Russian Wiktionary. We believe so because the value of the BLEU metric of our submission in the Russian language is higher than that of the other teams and in the other languages by an order of magnitude. However, we do not consider this a critical issue because the BERTScore metric is reasonably high and well above the baseline for all languages, suggesting that the matched defnitions capture the expected senses well. However, the corresponding low BLEU scores highlight the inadequacy of the BLEU metric for this task.\\n\\nSecondly, our approach to the second subtask has limitations. More specifcally, matching usage examples only against the defnitions of the target word, while effcient, considerably limits the system\\u2019s ability to describe completely new senses. Intuitively, a defnition associated with a different word may be a more suitable description of a new sense. A more robust solution would involve matching usage examples against all available defnitions. However, that would likely require using a bi-encoder architecture (as proposed by Blevins and Zettlemoyer (2020), for instance) instead of a cross-encoder due to the computational complexity of matching every example with every defnition.\\nAccessing the defnitions for all the words in a given language-specifc Wiktionary is timeconsuming because the layout, article structure, and templates used are completely different for each Wiktionary version. While there is a resource providing Wiktionary dumps in a much more convenient format,9 it is mostly limited in its support to the English language, with the support for some languages, such as Russian and German, being work in progress, and for others, such as Finnish, completely missing at the time of writing. Moreover, the Finnish, German, and Russian Wiktionaries differ in size and the fullness of their coverage. A rough estimate can be made by accessing the Special:Statistics page of each Wiktionary and examining the total number of unique pages (Table 4).\\nWe note the correlation between the smaller sizes of the Finnish and German Wiktionaries and the lower performance of our system on these languages.\\nLastly, although we did not focus on the frst subtask, we believe the results of the sense prediction task obtained with our systems could also be improved. For instance, the choice of the threshold value for determining a new sense could be done in a more systematic manner or made learnable.
