{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

This data usually has a temporal aspect, with the data created sequentially and representing events happening in some order. More generally, the data is a sequence of structured objects, each represented by a set of key-value pairs that encode the attributes of the object (Figure 1(a)). Examples include recordings of user interactions with websites, logs of machine activity, shopping decisions made by consumers, and many more (Figure 1(b)). The data is usually stored in semi-structured formats such as JSONs, or tabular forms.\\n\\nIn this paper, we explore the task of modeling semi-structured object sequences; in particular, we focus our attention on the problem of developing a structure-aware input representation for such sequences. If we think of the parallel to natural language data, we could treat each sentence of a text (Figure 1(c)) akin to the set of key-value pairs at a particular time step.\\nThe challenge of sequence length: A trivial method of representing such sequences would be to fatten each structured object and view its constituents as individual words for tokenization in natural language (Figure 1 (d)).2 However, this causes the sequence length to become extremely large (thousands of tokens) when operating on realword semi-structured sequences. For instance, in our study of semi-structured objects from userinteraction sessions on software from a large cloudbased service provider, we found these objects could contain 60 felds on average. The values of these felds include timestamps, identifers, log messages, etc., with an average of 5 words each. A session length of 15 minutes results in 105 such session objects, amounting to nearly 31, 500 words which would further increase the sequence length after sub-words are created.\\nRecord-centric representation: In contrast, to fattening structured objects, one could also create record-centric representations (Figure 1(f)) where the set of key-value representations at each time step are considered in sequence. As our experiments in Section 3.3 demonstrate, such represen\\nFigure 1: Semi-Structured Object Sequences: (a) Generic representation of a sequence of semi-structured objects, consisting of multiple key-value pairs at time steps $t_{1}\\\\ldots t_{N}$ .

(d) Encoding the example object in (a) by fattening. (e) Encoding (a) by encoding a representation of the values for each key (to be followed by a key aggregation step, not shown). (f) Encoding (a) using a record-centric representation for each time step.\\ntations do not work well when operating on long sequences. We hypothesize that this could be because the record-representation does not adequately model the dependencies between the constituent values of the same key across different time steps (records).\\nKey-centric representation: To address these challenges we use a modular, two-part hierarchical encoding strategy. First, we decompose the sequence of semi-structured objects into independent sets of sequences based on keys. This allows us to consider each key separately (Figure 1(e)), and encode a representation of how the values of that key evolve over time (we refer to this as Temporal Value Modeling \\u2013 TVM). This may be achieved using any encoder.3 We then self-attend over the set of the key encodings to create a representation of the entire structured object sequence (referred to as Key Aggregation \\u2013 KA).\\nAdvantages: This key-centric perspective of encoding semi-structured sequences has many advantages as compared to fattening and record-centric representations (Figure 1(f)).\\nDecoupling the keys allows us to support an arbitrary number of keys4 since each key-sequence is encoded independently. So, the key-representations created during Temporal Value Modeling can support longer sequences than what would have been impossible with fattening (due to memory constraints). Moreover, this encoding strategy also accommodates input sequences that may be considered non-structured \\u2013 e.g, natural language text as sequences of words in sentences (Figure 1(c)). Specifcally, if we consider a sequence of structured objects where each structured object consists of only one key, whose values contain a sentence, then our TVM effectively encodes the text sequence using whichever encoder has been employed.5\\n\\nThe decoupling of keys and the use of two independent encoders - TVM for value-aware key representations, and KA for aggregating keyrepresentations for a downstream task - requires that information be shared between the two networks so that the key-representations generated by TVM can be optimized for downstream tasks via the KA. To facilitate this, we share a few sets of attention heads between the two networks. First, we pre-train the TVM network with shared attention heads in place. We then use the frozen representations from this network to initialize the KA network, which has its own untrained attention heads, and the shared attention heads from the TVM network as part of its trainable parameters. We utilize a training schedule that interleaves the training of both modules to iteratively train them. Doing so allows the TVM and KA modules to create richer representations of keys, informed by their importance for the downstream task. We fnd that this novel iterative two part-training results in better performance compared to a unifed network with hierarchical encoding (with no attention-head sharing) as well as other methods, that either use a fattened representation or a record-centric representation of the sequence (Veli\\u02c7ckovi\\u00b4c et al., 2018; Mizrachi and Levin, 2019; de Souza Pereira Moreira et al., 2021; Padhi et al., 2021).\\n\\nContributions: Our work addresses the challenges of encoding semi-structured object sequences: (i) we propose a two-part approach that separately encodes the evolution of the values for each key, followed by aggregation over key-representations to accomplish downstream tasks; (ii) we present a novel approach for sharing attention heads between the components; (iii) we compare our approach against baselines such as sequence fattening, joint encoding, and record-centric sequence representations; and (iv) we present detailed experiments on several datasets and tasks to demonstrate the advantages of our approach.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We now describe our approach for modeling keyvalue semi-structured object sequences.\\nLet a sequence of semi-structured objects be denoted as $\\\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\\\mathcal{J}}&{{}=}&{\\\\left[J_{1},J_{2},J_{3},\\\\dots,J_{N}\\\\right]}\\\\end{array}$ corresponding to $N$ time steps. Further, let $\\\\ J_{i}\\\\ =$ $\\\\hat{\\\\{k}_{1}}\\\\colon v_{i}^{1},\\\\bar{k}_{2}\\\\colon v_{i}^{2},\\\\ldots,k_{j}\\\\colon\\\\hat{v}_{i}^{j},\\\\ldots,k_{K}\\\\colon v_{i}^{K}\\\\}$ denote a structured object $J_{i}$ , containing $K$ key-value pairs $<k_{j}\\\\colon v_{i}^{j}>,\\\\,\\\\,j\\\\,=\\\\,1\\\\ldots K$ .

The frst module, called the Temporal Value Modeler (TVM), is used to learn a combined representation (referred to as the keyrepresentations) for the different values that each key takes in the sequence.   \\n2. The second module, called the KeyAggregator (KA), uses the key-representations corresponding to each key, to create an overall representation for $\\\\mathcal{I}$ .\\nTemporal Value Modeling: Let $k$ be a key from the universe of all the keys $\\\\kappa$ in the sequence. Then, for each key $k$ we encode the value-aware keyrepresentation $V_{k}$ , by considering the value of the key $k$ at each timestamp, as a sequence. Formally, $V_{k}$ is given by:\\n\\nwhere [VAL_SEP] and [CLS] are special tokens. Note that each value $v_{j}^{k}$ for a key $k$ at time step $j$ can itself consist of many tokens and those have not been shown for ease of presentation. With any choice of a transformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) language encoder (TextEncoder \\u2013 TE), an embedding for $V_{k}$ , termed the key-representation (KR), can be obtained as:\\nWe use the output embedding representation at the frst position (corresponding to [CLS] ) as the keyrepresentation. It is easy to see that this formulation allows us to accommodate the modeling of natural language text as in Figure 1 (c). For illustration, if the T extEncoder is based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), Eq. 2 reduces to the encoding scheme typically employed in BERT for text paragraphs, where the [VAL_SEP] corresponds to the [SEP] token.\\nKey-Aggregation: Once we create keyrepresentations we utilize them for an end-task. We encode the key-representations using the same model architecture as the TVM T extEncoder but do not use positional embeddings since we encode a set of position-invariant key representations. Note that the weights of the KA are randomly initialized. This network is directly optimized for an end-task.\\nKey-centric vs. Record-centric Representation: As an alternative to the key-centric representation used by the TVM, one could construct a recordcentric view to model the sequence (de Souza Pereira Moreira et al., 2021; Padhi et al., 2021). Instead of modeling the evolution of keys in a semistructured object sequence using $V_{k}$ for each key, one could treat the sequence as a series of $J_{i}$ (Figure 1(f)). However, the record-centric representation requires the network to compress information present in multiple keys and values of a record $(J_{i})$ which can create an information bottleneck for the downstream task. We compare and contrast these alternative views in Section 3 and Section 5.\\nChallenges of Scalable Training: The training of the hierarchical two-part network, which frst obtains the key-representations (Eq. 2) and then the structured object sequence representation (Eq. 3), could be done end-to-end where the network parameters are directly trained for the downstream task. However, end-to-end training of the hierarchical two-part network is often diffcult due to the constraints imposed by the limited GPU memory. The GPU memory usage is affected by two factors: (1) the length of the semi-structured object sequence; and (2) the number of keys in an object. The end-to-end model architecture operating over a batch of $\\\\mathcal{I}$ sequences would exceed the memory of most commodity GPUs. By a conservative estimate, even for $n=11$ and $N=512$ , a typical 120M parameter model would exceed 40GB RAM limit with a batch-size of 2. To address this, we use an iterative training paradigm, described below, which interleaves the training of the TVM and KA components by relying on attention heads that are shared between the two components.\\nSharing Attention Heads: Recall that the TVM network frst creates a representation for each key by attending to the values that occur in the sequence for each of them. The KA network then uses these representations to learn the end task. However, if the KA network could infuence how these representations are created for each key, it could perhaps help improve the performance of the KA on the downstream task. We, therefore, introduce hardparameter sharing between the TVM and KA components. We hypothesize that by sharing a few attention heads (weights) between the two networks, the KA will be able to utilize the shared attention heads. Specifcally, as training progresses and updates the parameters used in these heads, it will have an effect of adjusting the key-representations from the TVM in a way that could help improve overall end-task performance.\\n\\nInterleaved Task Training: As mentioned above, we use an iterative task training paradigm where we interleave the training of the TVM and KA components. Note that our training paradigm is different from traditional training schedules for sequential task training where one network is fully trained before the next module, or from fne-tuning approaches where a part of the network may be initialized with a pre-trained model and additional layers of the network are initialized randomly and then updated for an end-task. We use the Masked language modeling (MLM) objective (Devlin et al., 2019) to train the TVM component and an endtask-specifc objective for training the KA. The use of interleaved training, as outlined in Algorithm 1, prevents the problem of catastrophic forgetting (French, 1999; McCloskey and Cohen, 1989; McClelland et al., 1995; Kumaran et al., 2016; Ratcliff,\\n1990) when the KA is trained. Further, it is possible that when the TVM is trained for the frst time it may rely heavily on the heads that are shared. Thus, any change to the representation from these heads could lead to poorer key-representations and attention sharing, and would therefore would be counter-productive. To address this problem, we apply DropHead (Zhou et al., 2020) on the shared attention heads in TVM and pre-train the model before beginning the interleaving schedule.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"1: Initialize Temporal Value Modeler $\\\\mathcal{M}_{v}$ , Key Aggregator $\\\\mathcal{M}_{k}$ parameters randomly.   \\n2: Prepare the dataset $D_{v}$ consisting of value sequences   \\n3: for $\\\\mathbf{i}=1,2,\\\\dotsc,\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\ \\\\mathbf{d}\\\\mathbf{0}$   \\n4: \\u25b7 TVM training   \\n5: Update TVM $\\\\mathbf{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{v}$ model parameters with MLM objective on $D_{v}$ .   \\n6: Prepare the dataset $D_{k}$ consisting of keyrepresentations ${\\\\mathrm{KR}}_{k}$ as per Eq. 2   \\n7: \\u25b7 KA training   \\n8: Update Key Aggregator $\\\\mathcal{M}_{k}$ model parameters with cross-entropy loss for downstream task.   \\n9: end for\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Our experiments are designed to answer the following questions: (i) How helpful is the TVM-KA architecture over the baseline that involves fattening semi-structured object sequences?

These milestone events are chosen to represent revenue generation and user experience, respectively. The case of 3) no milestone event occurring is treated as third class.

Existing work on this dataset has focused on a simpler binary prediction task where models are asked to predict if a particular item is likely to be purchased again.8\\nLogHub Data: We use the HDFS-1 from LogHub (He et al., 2020) for the log anomaly detection task. As the dataset originally consisted of lines of log messages, we use the Drain log parser (He et al., 2017) to identify 48 log templates. Using a semi-automated approach, we assign key names to the value slots of the templates. Thus, each log line is converted to a structured object with 46 keyvalue pairs. The original dataset splits the log lines into blocks, and the binary prediction task is to predict whether a particular block is anomalous. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with around $3\\\\%$ of the instances belonging to the anomalous class. We therefore report F1-Score for the anomalous class.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Baselines: We fatten each key-value pair in a structured object and encode them with special markers indicating boundaries for objects and timesteps. We fne-tune the pre-trained encoders for each downstream task and report their performance. We experiment with BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) as the pre-trained encoders.\\nWe also compare our model with popular approaches for creating record-centric representations. These approaches frst obtain the representations for each object $J_{i}$ , and then feed them to an inter-object transformer to create the representation of the whole sequence of objects. We experiment with three popular methods, where each object representation is obtained from the key-value pair representations by 1) point-wise summation, 2) concatenation then project-down (Mizrachi and Levin, 2019; de Souza Pereira Moreira et al., 2021), and 3) self-attention then averaging (Zhang et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2021). Note that the record-centric baseline can be viewed as an adaptation of the TabBERT model originally designed for tabular data (Padhi et al., 2021). Padhi et al. (2021) use a feld transformer (a transformer encoder similar to BERT) to encode all rows in the table independently to obtain row embeddings. These row embeddings are later passed through another encoder to obtain a representation for the entire table. We use selfattention instead of a feld transformer to encode\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Pre-trained models for tokens cannot be meaningfully used to initialize record-centric baselines as these create sequences over sets of key-value pairs. On the other hand, identifying a custom pretraining objective for baselines is challenging as the downstream task of predicting the next event\\/product involves predicting a value for a very specifc key at a future time step (which is very similar to an objective one might think of for pre-training). Hence, we randomly initialize the weights of the record-centric models.\\nEncoders for TVM-KA: One of the advantages of the TVM-KA architecture is that it is agnostic to the choice of the encoder. We employ the same encoder architectures used in our baselines to enable a direct performance comparison. Recall that the TVM module and KA module share attention heads to facilitate sharing of information between them. To pre-train the TVM, we mask $15\\\\%$ of the tokens in every Value Sequence, and the objective is to predict the masked tokens. We do not mask valueseparator and key aggregator tokens; we only mask the values. Details on hyper-parameter tuning and the iterative training schedule are in the appendix.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
