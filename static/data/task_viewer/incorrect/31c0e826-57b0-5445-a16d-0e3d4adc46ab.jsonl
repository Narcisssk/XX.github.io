{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The plot demonstrates the dimin-\\nishing returns observed with increasing\\namounts of data used for parameter effi-\\ncient fine-tuning.\\nGiven a user input x, our goal is to generate a di-\\nverse set of high-quality responses y1, y2, ..., yK from\\na foundation model M. One approach to generating\\ndiverse responses is to sample from the model multi-\\nple times using techniques like temperature sampling:\\nyk = M(x; \\u03b8, \\u03c4), where k = 1, 2, ..., K and \\u03b8 rep-\\nresents the model parameters and \\u03c4 is the temperature\\nhyperparameter. However, this approach often trades\\noff diversity for quality as studied in Chung et al.\\n(2023). An alternative approach is to train multiple\\nmodel adaptations M1, M2, ..., MK and sample one\\nresponse from each adaptation:\\nyk = Mk(x; \\u03b8k),\\nk = 1, 2, ..., K,\\n(2)\\nwhere \\u03b8k represents the parameters of the k-th model\\nadaptation. By training each adaptation on a differ-\\nent subset of the data that captures unique aspects and\\nyields distinct model behaviors, we can generate di-\\nverse responses while maintaining their quality. Moreover, this approach allows us to elicit diverse\\nsamples even with greedy sampling, which is often preferred for maximum precision.\\nTraditionally, training multiple model adaptations has been considered unfavorable due to the re-\\npeated training process, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. However,\\nwith the increasing popularity of instruction tuning, it has become common practice to go through\\na post-training stage using instruction data before deploying the model to users. This post-training\\nstage presents an opportunity to train multiple model adaptations without incurring significant addi-\\ntional costs, making the approach more feasible and practical in real-world scenarios.\\nAs the volume of synthetic data grows, the utility of fine-tuning a single model on the entire dataset\\ndiminishes due to the diminishing returns in the post-training stage, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. The\\npass@1 accuracy after fine-tuning on the entire synthetic dataset using LORA is roughly the same\\nas only consuming 15% of the data2. This creates an opportunity to leverage the abundant synthetic\\ndata to train multiple model adaptations, each specializing in a specific subset of the data. In this\\nwork, we propose the Synthesize, Partition, then Adapt (SPA) framework to address the diverse re-\\nsponse generation problem. SPA leverages existing synthetic datasets, data partitioning techniques,\\nand parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to train multiple model adaptations.

This finding is consistent with existing studies [73, 26], and motivates the use of\\nfunctional correctness metrics instead.\\nLLM-as-a-judge. We also assess our models using the well-known LLM-as-a-judge metric, as\\nreferenced in previous studies [75, 46, 17]. For this evaluation, we employ GPT-4, the top-performing\\ncode model, as the judge. The downward trend in scores suggests that the LLM-judge has some\\nintuition. However, Figure 4b reveals that its precision is low (hovering between 10% and 30%),\\nindicating a high rate of misclassification where incorrect solutions are frequently judged as correct.\\n3.3\\nAssessing common enhancement strategies\\nFew-shot and chain-of-thought. These prompting strategies are commonly used in code generation\\ntasks [24, 40]. Few-shot prompting involves providing a few examples to guide the model. The\\nspecific prompt used in our experiments is detailed in Appendix. B.1, where we employ three-shot\\nprompting [73]. Chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) guides the model through a step-by-step process\\nto arrive at a solution, mimicking human logical progression. In our approach, we ask the model\\nto reason through the overall structure of the desired infrastructure, covering services, resources,\\nand individual attributes (Appendix. B.2). Our findings indicate that these methods yield unreliable\\nimprovements, sometimes even degrading performance. For instance, both strategies reduced GPT-4\\u2019s\\nscore from 19.36% to 10.64% and 9.31%, respectively. This is likely due to the extensive service\\ndiversity within cloud infrastructure, limiting the effectiveness of these strategies.\\nMulti-turn. This is a prompting strategy widely used in existing work [62, 71]. Here we assume the\\nmodel has access to an interpreter to evaluate the generation; errors within the compilation phase\\nare passed back to the LLM as additional context for program repair. Our setup involves two turns\\nof interaction between the model and the interpreter. We observe a noticeable improvement across\\nour Top-4 models (5.5% on average), and a slight decrease in performance for our remaining models\\n(0.92% on average). The specific prompt used is detailed in Appendix. B.3.\\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [63]. This approach leverages a vector database [47] that\\nstores relevant IaC documentation [37] for contextual retrieval. Given the problem input, the LLM\\nfirst helps identify key terms and contextual cues to retrieve relevant documentation and code snippets\\nfrom our database. The LLM then uses the retrieved documentation snippets as context to generate\\nthe final IaC code. This approach allows the LLM to access examples of similar code snippets, API\\ndocumentation, or coding patterns pertinent to the problem, enabling more accurate and contextually\\nappropriate generation. We observe a noticeable improvement across all models, with an average\\nincrease of 6.14%, making this the most effective strategy we\\u2019ve evaluated. Our prompt used is\\nshown in Appendix. B.4.\\nOverall, these methods may provide modest improvements, but we hope the introduction of IaC-Eval\\nwill catalyze further research specifically tailored to improving IaC code generation.\\n7\\nTable 2: Average benchmark scores of various models when enhanced with differing strategies,\\nranked by highest score across all strategies.

Basically, for each input token, most of the well-trained experts do not contribute to the\\noutput prediction. As a result, the potential of utilizing more experts during the inference stage to\\nenhance performance remains underexplored.\\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of unchosen experts3 on the performance of MoE models and\\nexplore their suitable usage. A direct hypothesis is that incorporating more experts improves MoE\\nmodels and helps solve more difficult problems [12\\u201314]. However, in our exploratory experiment on\\nMixtral 8x7B [6], we find simply raising the number of activated experts (blue lines in Figure 1) does\\nnot lead to stable improvements and may even hurt performance on different tasks. This indicates that\\nunchosen experts may contribute little or even negatively to the final performance, which is contrary\\nto the common perception of unchosen experts as candidates of positive power.\\nInspired by the finding, we further dive deep into the difference between the output probability\\ndistributions of MoE models applying different routing strategies. As shown in Figure 3, we calculate\\nthe Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the token distributions obtained from the default\\ntop-2 routing and rank-k routing, and find apparent discrepancy. The discrepancy is particularly\\nevident in the parts that require rigorous reasoning. This suggests that different experts do not always\\nact synergistically; instead, they may exhibit conflicting behaviors.\\nTherefore, we introduce Self-Contrast Mixture-of-Experts (SCMoE), which can convert the negative\\neffects brought by unchosen experts into positive ones through contrasting the output logits obtained\\nusing different routing strategies. Specifically, the probability of next token is based on the logits\\ndifference between strong and weak activation of the MoE models. For \\\"strong activation\\\" and\\n\\\"weak activation\\\", we use the top-2 routing strategy (Figure 2 (a)) and the rank-k routing strategy\\n(Figure 2 (b)) respectively. Thus, SCMoE enables unchosen experts to contribute to the prediction.\\nAn overview of how SCMoE works is presented in Figure 2 (c).\\nExperimental results on various benchmarks across different domains demonstrate that SCMoE\\nsignificantly enhances Mixtral 8x7B\\u2019s reasoning capability (Section 3). Specifically, compared to\\ngreedy decoding, the accuracy increases from 61.79 to 66.94 (+5.15) on GSM8K, 72.83 to 76.29\\n(+3.46) on StrategyQA, and the pass@1 accuracy increases from 46.20 to 48.80 (+2.60) on MBPP\\nand 33.54 to 41.46 (+7.92) on HumanEval. Further analysis shows that SCMoE can even surpass the\\nresult of using self-consistency with major@5 (66.87) on GSM8K. What\\u2019s more, combining SCMoE\\nwith self-consistency can further boost the model\\u2019s performance, improving major@20 accuracy\\nfrom 75.59 to 78.31 (+2.72) on GSM8K. Regarding inference efficiency, it turns out that SCMoE\\nincurs only a minor (x1.30) delay compared to greedy decoding, which is competitive among several\\nstrong decoding baselines. To sum up, empirical results and comprehensive analyses demonstrate\\nthat SCMoE is a both effective and efficient approach to unleashing MoE models\\u2019 power.\\n2\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

FUNCODER\\nconsistently boosts the performance of smaller models in code generation, demonstrating notable\\nimprovements compared to standard prompting on HumanEval, which gained +29.4% on Llama3,\\n+32.8% on StableCode, and even +51.5% on CodeLlama, outperforming that from the previous best\\nmethod CodeT. We also supplement results on GPT-4o mini, Codestral and StarCoder2 in Table 11.\\nExperiment results demonstrate that our method archives state-of-the-art performance on various\\nmodels, ranging from basic programming to competition contests.\\n3.1.3\\nAnalysis\\nFUNCODER Democratize to Smaller LLMs Limited by the LLM capabilities, the application of self-\\nimprovement or multi-agent methods on smaller models is without ease. By keeping decomposition\\nand composition within the code generation process, our approach exhibits better generalization. As\\nshown in Table 1, with FUNCODER, StableCode3b achieves around 118.6% relative performance to\\nstandard GPT-3.5, and also aligns closely with GPT-4 by about 97.7% on HumanEval.\\nPreliminary Study on Self-Testing Method We conduct a preliminary study targeting the self-testing\\nmethod on HumanEval, results are shown in Figure 3.a with further details in Appendix A.5. We first\\nverify whether model-generated programs can also pass model-generated self-tests: (a) If a program\\npasses self-tests, most from GPT-3.5 would also work on system tests, as much as 19.5%\\/64% \\u224830.5%\\nprograms from StableCode are rejected, indicating that smaller models like StableCode may not\\neffectively self-test and detect program errors on its own. (b) In the event of failed self-tests, a large\\nportion of failures are attributed to issues in self-tests instead of the programs, on both GPT-3.5\\nand StableCode. These phenomena indicate that self-testing methods have limitations in generating\\ncorrect and reliable unit tests. As a result, we design functional consensus to not require any assertion,\\nbut perform mutual verification between solutions instead, as opposed to self-testing.\\nEffectiveness of Functional Consensus Functional consensus or self-testing may be viewed as\\nranking algorithms for selecting functions. To measure ranking effectiveness, we conduct an analysis\\non HumanEval with GPT-3.5. For each problem, 11 candidates are ranked with 3 strategies: consensus,\\nself-test, and random shuffle (as a baseline). Effectiveness is measured via Pass@k, i.e. if any of the\\ntop-k ranked programs pass the system test. Figure 3.b shows that functional consensus achieves\\n94.7% upper bound (Pass@11) performance by selecting a single function (Pass@1), and is close\\nto that of self-test on Pass@4. This clearly demonstrates that functional consensus can effectively\\nevaluate correctness and pick the most promising implementation on the first attempt.\\nAblation and Token Usage To analyze the impact of dividing, conquering, and functional consensus\\nin FUNCODER, we carry out an ablation study with different settings. Studies that replace consensus\\nwith self-testing, or with AlphaCode-like (Li et al., 2022) clustering, are also included. The ablation\\nis constructed on HumanEval with GPT-3.5, as shown in Table 2. Note that to generate every\\nprogram FUNCODER costs only O(kN) tokens, where k is the number of sampled candidates,\\n6\\nTable 2: Ablation study of FUNCODER on HumanEval with GPT-3.5.

This is further exemplified and explained in\\n\\u00a7A.7. We observe that function decomposition and re-composition deliver cumulative performance\\nimprovements. Functional consistency is also shown to prevail over self-testing. Putting them all\\ntogether, FUNCODER received a +17.1 improvement with just 5.09\\u00d7 more tokens over baseline.\\nCompared to previous SOTA LDB (\\u224823K tokens), we are able to gain +2.5 in performance with\\n76.5% token usage reduction.\\n3.2\\nMathematical Reasoning\\nCode can be viewed as a tool for augmenting the reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Chen et al., 2023b).\\nAlternative to text-based reasoning like Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), programs can offer\\nunique advantages in terms of iteration and calculations. To test the generalizability of FUNCODER\\nbeyond algorithm challenges, we conduct an experiment on MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), a\\ncompetition-level mathematical reasoning benchmark.\\n3.2.1\\nExperiment Setup\\nBenchmark The experiment is conducted on a subset of the MATH test set, including 500 randomly\\nsampled problems that can be classified into 7 disjoint subjects or 5 difficulty levels. It can be noticed\\nthat labels in MATH are formatted in L\\nA\\nT\\nEX, rendering exact-match verdicts impractical. We, therefore,\\nfollow previous work (Zhang et al., 2024) and adopt GPT-4 to determine the correspondence between\\npredictions and labels, with further details provided in Appendix A.4.\\nBaselines We compare FUNCODER with the text-based baselines: Standard Prompting and Chain-\\nof-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), and program-aided baselines: Program-of-Thought (Chen et al.,\\n2023b), Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), Cumulative Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024). The results of\\nCumulative reasoning are reported in the original paper. Standard prompting and chain-of-thought\\nreasoning use 7-shot demonstrations constructed from the train set. Program-of-Thought and Self-\\nRefine prompt the model with 1-shot demonstration to generate a solution() function that solves\\nthe problem. Additionally, self-refine iteratively refines programs based on runtime feedback. All\\nbaseline methods are run with self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) at 5.\\nImplementation Details\\nFUNCODER adopts a program-aided reasoning setting that writes a\\nsolution() function and obtains the final prediction by running this program. The number of\\nsampled implementations |F| in functional consensus is set to 5 to match baseline methods.\\n3.2.2\\nResults\\nThe experimental results on MATH are shown in Table 3. It shows that program-aided reasoning\\ngenerally outperforms text-based reasoning. With GPT-4 as the backbone, FUNCODER outperforms\\nthe strongest baseline Cumulative Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024) by (6.0 \\/ 8.3%) and surpasses the\\nvanilla program-aided baseline PoT (Chen et al., 2023b) by (10.0 \\/ 14.7%). When using GPT-3.5-\\nturbo as the backbone, FUNCODER exceeds the strongest baseline by (6.2 \\/ 11.1%) and outperforms\\nPoT by as much as (13.0 \\/ 31.7%), which indicates that our approach has a strong advantage over\\nboth text-based reasoning and other program-aided reasoning methods.\\n7\\nTable 3: Experimental results on MATH, a competition-level mathematical reasoning benchmark.\\nBest results are in bold.

It illus-\\ntrates that CoT performs comparatively well on\\nthe easiest questions, but suffers from a steep\\ndecline in performance as difficulty increases.\\nThis suggests that text-based reasoning is inad-\\nequate for tackling challenging mathematical\\nreasoning problems. The same situation is also\\nobserved in PoT. In contrast, our method consis-\\ntently demonstrates high performance even on\\nchallenging problems, particularly excelling on\\nlevel 5 difficulty with nearly double the perfor-\\nmance compared to PoT and CoT. This reflects that our method, with divide-and-conquer applied,\\ncan effectively cope with complex problems.\\nDecomposed Functions are Domain-Specific We hypothesize that questions from the same subject\\nrequire similar knowledge reserves, which should be reflected in the functionality of the sub-functions.\\nTo verify this hypothesis, we statisticize the common sub-functions of FUNCODER in each MATH\\nsubject, as shown in Table 4. It is apparent that different subjects require different abilities, each\\nwith its own set of sub-functions closely associated with the domain knowledge. In addition, these\\ncommon sub-functions are fundamentally basic and straightforward. As exemplified in Appendix B.2,\\nour method is able to leverage and combine these basic sub-functions to achieve more complex goals,\\nthereby reducing the complexity of reasoning and enhancing performance.\\n8\\nTable 4: Top-3 most commonly used functions in each subject of MATH, listed in descending order.\\nSubject\\nFunctions\\nPrealgebra\\nis_prime \\/ factorial \\/ gcd\\nAlgebra\\nfind_roots \\/ is_perfect_square \\/ find_domain\\nNumber Theory\\nget_divisors \\/ mod_inverse \\/ gcd\\nCounting & Probability\\nfactorial \\/ combinations \\/ binomial_coefficient\\nGeometry\\ndi ...\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
