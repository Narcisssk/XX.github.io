{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

This personalized vision of healthcare has\\ngiven rise to virtual patients constructed with data-tuned models, known as digital twins. Originally\\nan engineering concept, digital twins have recently been realized as a resource in healthcare (6; 4).\\nThe concept combines data-driven approaches with mechanistic or simulation techniques, serving as\\na bidirectional map between real data and simulations. Medical digital twins have been applied and\\ndeveloped broadly in applications ranging from cellular mechanics (24) to the development of whole\\nbody and human digital twins (50; 76), with aims ranging from tailoring cardiovascular interventions\\n(30) to agent-based trauma care management systems (14). Both academic and industry efforts are\\nprolific with digital twins having been developed for various medical problems (9; 69; 74; 13; 22; 70).\\nIn this paper, we propose a framework for identifying patient-level digital twins using noninvasive\\nmedical images. We focus on scenarios where identifying a patient\\u2019s digital twin from noninvasive\\ndata allows us to simulate other physiological parameters that typically require invasive measurement,\\nsuch as through catheterization. Such an approach assumes that there is a mapping from rich non-\\ninvasive imaging data to patient-specific mechanistic models of physiology; such a mapping is not\\nknown to scientists humans but can be learned from data. This hypothesis is supported by previous\\nexperimental work (2; 64; 43). However, the challenge lies in the absence of datasets containing both\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nnoninvasive data and the corresponding parameters of the underlying physics-based physiological\\nmodel, hence the problem cannot be solved using standard supervised learning. To this end, we pro-\\npose a new class of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) (60) to incorporate inductive biases\\ninformed by mechanistic models of patient physiology into neural network architectures.\\nSummary of contributions. We study obtaining la-\\ntent parameters of a physics-based model from image\\nmeasurements directly as an inverse problem. Learn-\\ning patient specific parameters for a physics-based\\nmodel from a complete description of patient physi-\\ncal states and a known forward model is an inverse\\nproblem. This task can be modeled using, for exam-\\nple, a PINN approach (71; 39; 29). The process of\\nobtaining patient physical states from non-invasive\\nmedical imaging is a second inverse problem with an\\nunknown forward model. Obtaining patient specific\\nlatent parameters from non-invasive medical imaging\\ndirectly combines these two inverse problems and\\ncould be modeled by learning the unknown process\\ncomponents.

Instead, we propose a training approach that structurally resembles self-\\nsupervised learning (SSL), and leverages labeled data pairs of images and non-invasively measurable\\npatient physical states. We first train a neural network using supervised learning with synthetic data to\\napproximate the forward physics-based model as a pre-text task. We then freeze this network to fine-\\ntune the learning of a solution to the composite inverse problem from the labeled measurable data pairs.\\nOur methods are then extendable to include exogenous intervention parameters for the development\\nof in-silico experiments. We call this framework \\u201cMed-Real2Sim\\u201d since it learns virtual simulators\\nof patient phyisology on the basis of real (noninvasive) data.\\nWe apply our methodology in the setting of predicting patient specific cardiac pressure-volume\\nloops from echocardiography. The relationship between left-ventricle pressure and volume is an\\nimportant description of cardiac function (36). Pressure-volume catheter measurements are highly\\ninvasive, challenging their routine clinical use (8; 1; 77). Cardiac ejection fraction, the ratio between\\nleft-ventricular stroke volume and end-diastolic volume, while more routinely measured as a proxy\\nfor cardiac function, does not take into account cardiac pressure, preventing diagnosis of many severe\\ncardiac conditions and providing motivation to develop digital twins for pressure-volume relations\\n(80; 45; 59). Cardiovascular pressure and volume are commonly modeled using hydraulic analogy\\nmodels, representing the hydraulic system by electronic circuits, characterized by lumped parameters\\ncorresponding to system attributes. Systems of differential equations describe the relationships\\nbetween circuit parameters and volume and pressure states. A model developed in (66) relates\\nleft-ventricular pressure and volume with and without the addition of a left-ventricular assistance\\ndevice (LVAD). We train a neural network to learn to map between parameters and solution states\\nof this model and use this learning to fine-tune a convolutional neural network that learns patient\\nspecific model parameters using echocardiography frames.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Method\",\"section_content\":\"Method\\n2.1\\nProblem Setup\\nWe consider a physics-based model M : \\u0398 \\u2192X of a physiological process which maps a set of\\nparameters \\u03b8 \\u2208\\u0398 to a set of states x \\u2208X. The parameters \\u03b8 describe the physiological process in an\\nindividual patient; each patient i is associated with a patient-specific parameter set \\u03b8i and physical\\nstates xi. We are interested in a setup where the complete set of parameters and states can only\\nbe measured invasively, e.g., through a catheterization procedure. We conceptualize the physics-based\\nmodel M(\\u03b8i) as the \\u201cDigital Twin\\u201d of patient i. That is, if we have oracle access to the parameters \\u03b8i\\nof patient i, then we can simulate their physiological states through the following forward process:\\nx = M(\\u03b8).\\n(1)\\nThe model M is assumed to be known and would typically be defined by a system of differential\\nequations written f\\u03b8(x) = 0 with a physically interpretable parameter set \\u03b8. One can use numerical\\n2\\nmethods to solve f\\u03b8(x) = 0 for x and construct the solution M(\\u03b8i) for each patient parameter set \\u03b8i\\nbut a closed form solution to define the map M may not exist even though the model is known, such\\nas in the case where f\\u03b8 = 0 has no closed form solution. The level of granularity in simulating the\\n(true) physiological process depends on the fidelity of the physics-based model M.\\nIn addition to modeling the natural state of the physiological process, we also consider physics-based\\nmodels of clinical interventions (e.g., medical devices). To model an interventional process, we\\nconsider an augmented version of the physics-based model f\\nM : \\u0398 \\u00d7 U \\u2192X, which maps the\\nendogenous parameters \\u03b8 \\u2208\\u0398 of the patient and an exogenous intervention u \\u2208U to a physiological\\nstate x \\u2208X. The augmented model describes how the intervention u alters the physiological states\\nof a patient with parameters \\u03b8\\u2014in the causal inference literature, this class of models is known as\\nstructural causal models (SCMs) (57).\\nTo identify the model M(\\u03b8) traditionally and simulate the states x, one would need to conduct a\\nnumber of invasive procedures for each patient. Here, we assume that we have access to a measurement\\nyi for each patient i, which reflects some aspects of the underlying physiological process. We assume\\nthat y is acquired through a non-invasive procedure that might be conducted routinely in clinical\\npractice (e.g., an electrocardiogram). The relationship between the physiological state x and the\\nnon-invasive measurement y is given by\\ny = K(x).\\n(2)\\nThus, by combining (1) and (2), we arrive at the following relation between the parameters of the\\nphysics-based model and the non-invasive measurements:\\ny =\\nK\\n|{z}\\nUnknown\\n\\u25e6M\\n|{z}\\nKnown\\n(\\u03b8) = F(\\u03b8).\\n(3)\\nThat is, the relation between the non-invasive measurements and the physical model parameters\\nis a composition of two functions; an unknown map K that describes the relation between the\\nphysiological states and the observed measurements (e.g., the relation between pixels in an imaging\\nmodality and underlying health states), and a known mathematical model M that captures the relation\\nbetween the physiological states and unknown parameters \\u03b8. Our goal is to develop a learning\\nalgorithm to identify the digital twin M(\\u03b8i) for patient i given their non-invasive measurement yi.\\nDigital Twin Modeling as an Inverse Problem. Note that obtaining patient-specific parameters \\u03b8i\\nfrom physical states xi amounts to solving the following inverse problem:\\n\\u03b8 = M\\u22121(x).\\n(4)\\nHowever, we do not directly observe the state x, but rather a measurement y obtained by passing\\nx through the unknown forward model K. Thus, obtaining the physical parameters from y entails\\nsolving the composite inverse problem given by:\\n\\u03b8 = F\\u22121(y) = M\\u22121 \\u25e6K\\u22121(y).\\n(5)\\nSolving this problem entails two challenges. First, we do not know the forward model K. Second,\\nwe cannot directly learn the inverse map F\\u22121 using supervised learning since this requires access to\\na labeled dataset {(yi, \\u03b8i)}i. Obtaining such a dataset would require conducting a large number of\\ninvasive procedures, which we seek to avoid.\\nAn alternative way to learn the inverse map F\\u22121 is to break down the composite inverse problem\\nin (5) into separate inverse problems, and only learn the inverse of the unknown map K\\u22121 using\\nexamples of the form {(yi, xi)}i by fixing the map M. If we can construct a mapping representative\\nof M from any patient parameter set \\u03b8 \\u2208\\u0398 to state x \\u2208X, then as we can write K\\u22121 as follows:\\nK\\u22121 : Y \\u2192F\\u22121 \\u0398 \\u2192M X\\n(6)\\nwe can learn F\\u22121 using training samples which only train K\\u22121.\\nAs we will ultimately use supervised methods and gradient descent to learn Eq. (6), we need a method\\nfor fixing M that allows for mapping any arbitrary parameter set \\u03b8 to corresponding state x. There\\nare several methods in the literature for solving the forward dynamics of M that we might think of\\nto construct this mapping. These include physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) (60), which\\ntrain a network to approximate the solution xi to f\\u03b8i(xi) = 0 thereby solving M(\\u03b8i) for a fixed\\npatient parameter set \\u03b8i. Traditional PINNs learn the function xi by incorporating the differential\\n3\\nequation f\\u03b8i = 0 as a soft-constraint in the network\\u2019s training loss alongside a data loss. In the\\nsetting of a ordinary differential equations, Neural ODEs (10) train a network to learn the differential\\nequation operator f\\u03b8i on the states xi to solve for xi = M(\\u03b8i) using differentiable ODE solvers.\\nThese methods can learn M(\\u03b8i) for a fixed patient parameter set \\u03b8i and can be compared to the use\\nof a numerical differential equation solvers.\\nThese existent approaches for solving M, however, only give the states x for a single patient at a\\ntime. To learn K\\u22121 by training a network through the map M, we need a method that approximates\\nthe map as otherwise, we would need to train infinitely many separate PINNs or Neural ODEs to\\ncover the entirety of a plausible parameter range potentially traversed in supervised learning of (6).\\nNon-Invasive Data Acquisition. While we do not have direct access to the patient physiological state\\nxi to train a model to learn K\\u22121, the noninvasive observation yi typically measures physiological\\nquantities that can also be derived from the true state xi. We assume that \\u00af\\nx is a physiological\\nvariable that can be derived from both x and y, i.e.,\\n\\u00af\\nx = m(x) = g(y),\\n(7)\\nwhere m(.) is a known function and g(.) is a labeling procedure, typically conducted manually\\nby a physician or automatically through a built-in algorithm in the data acquisition device. This\\nphysiological variable represents a quantity of interest assessed by the noninvasive modality (e.g.,\\nbreast density in mammography, blood pumping efficiency in ultrasound). These variables estab-\\nlish a connection between the true state x and the observation y, as they can be both simulated from\\nthe physical model and measured based on y.\\nGiven the setup above, our digital twin modeling problem can be formulated as follows. Given a\\ndataset of noninvasive measurements for n patients, D = {yi}n\\ni=1, and a physiological variable of in-\\nterest \\u00af\\nxi = m(xi) = g(yi), our goal is to train a model that can identify the underlying physics-based\\ntwin M(\\u03b8n+1) for a new patient n + 1 based solely on their corresponding noninvasive measurement\\nyn+1. We seek to do this by fixing M and learning K\\u22121 from the data D = {(yi, \\u00af\\nxi)}n\\ni=1.\\n2.2\\nPhysics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning\\nGiven the training dataset D = {(yi, \\u00af\\nxi)}n\\ni=1, a typical supervised learning task is to train a model\\nto predict the physiological variable \\u00af\\nxi on the basis of the noninvasive observation yi via standard\\nempirical risk minimization (ERM):\\nb\\nf = arg min\\nf\\n1\\nn\\nPn\\ni=1\\u2113(f(yi), \\u00af\\nxi).\\n(8)\\nThe motivation for training the model b\\nf is usually to automate the collection of physiological variables\\nfrom medical images in a clinical workflow (68). These models follow a fully data-driven approach\\nand do not incorporate our knowledge of how the physiological processes being measured function\\non the biological or physical levels. One could think of the supervised model b\\nf as a data-driven\\nmodel of the function g(.) in (7).\\nRecall that our goal is to recover the latent physical parameters \\u03b8 that underlie the physiologi-\\ncal processes that generated the observation y. If we had oracle access to a dataset of the form\\nD\\u2217= {(yi, \\u03b8i)}n\\ni=1, then a supervised solution to identifying the digital twin would be:\\nb\\nf = arg min\\nf\\n1\\nn\\nPn\\ni=1\\u2113(f(yi), \\u03b8i).\\n(9)\\nThe solution to (9) provides an approximate solution to the inverse problem in (5). As we lack access\\nto D\\u2217, we can only learn the solution to (5) using the observed dataset D. To this end, we propose a\\ntwo-step approach for learning the parameters \\u03b8 from y, leveraging the structural similarity between\\nthe composite inverse problem in (5) and the pretraining\\/finetuning paradigm in self-supervised\\nlearning (SSL). An illustration of the two steps is provided in Figure 2(a).\\nStep 1: Physics-Informed Pretext Task. In this step, we pretrain a neural network to imitate the\\nforward dynamics of the physics-based model, i.e., x = M(\\u03b8). We do so by first sampling \\u02dc\\nn synthetic\\ntraining examples from the physics-based forward dynamics as follows:\\n\\u02dc\\n\\u03b8j \\u223cUniform(\\u0398), \\u02dc\\nxj = M(\\u02dc\\n\\u03b8j), 1 \\u2264j \\u2264\\u02dc\\nn.\\n(10)\\n4\\nWe denote this synthetic dataset by e\\nD = {(\\u02dc\\n\\u03b8j, \\u02dc\\nxj)}j. Next, we use this dataset to train a feed forward\\nneural network on the pretext task of predicting the patient physiological states from the physical\\nparameters using ERM as follows:\\nb\\n\\u03d5M = arg min\\n\\u03d5\\n1\\n\\u02dc\\nn\\nP\\u02dc\\nn\\nj=1\\u2113(\\u03d5(\\u02dc\\n\\u03b8j), \\u02dc\\nxj).\\n(11)\\nThis training process distills the true physics-based model, M(\\u03b8), into the weights of a neural network\\nb\\n\\u03d5M. That is, the forward pass of the network will emulate the forward dynamics of the physiological\\nprocess, i.e., x \\u2248b\\n\\u03d5M(\\u03b8).\\nStep 2: Physics-Guided Finetuning. Given the observed dataset D = {(yi, \\u00af\\nxi)}i, we train another\\nmodel to predict the physical parameters \\u03b8 from the observed measurements y using the loss function\\nb\\n\\u03d5F = arg min\\n\\u03d5\\n1\\nn\\nPn\\ni=1\\u2113(m(b\\n\\u03d5M \\u25e6\\u03d5(yi)), \\u00af\\nxi).\\n(12)\\nHere, the model pretrained on synthetic data from the physical simulator, b\\n\\u03d5M, is frozen and only\\nthe model b\\n\\u03d5F is finetuned using real data on y and \\u00af\\nx. The neural network trained in Step 2, b\\n\\u03d5F,\\nrepresents an approximate solution to the composite inverse problem in (3), i.e., b\\n\\u03d5F(.) \\u2248F\\u22121(.).\\nFor a new patient n + 1, we discard the pretrained model b\\n\\u03d5M, and use the model b\\n\\u03d5F to predict the\\npatient\\u2019s digital twin based on their noninvasive measurement yn+1 as follows:\\nb\\n\\u03b8n+1 = b\\n\\u03d5F(yn+1), b\\nxn+1 = M(b\\n\\u03b8n+1).\\n(13)\\nInterpretation of Physics-Informed SSL. Our proposed algorithm structurally resembles the SSL\\nparadigm, where, akin to SSL, we decompose our model into a \\u201cbackbone\\u201d architecture and a task-\\nspecific \\u201chead\\u201d (47). However, there are fundamental conceptual differences between standard SSL\\napproaches and ours. In standard SSL, the backbone is a high-capacity model pretrained on a pretext\\ntask using unlabeled data to derive a general-purpose representation transferable to many downstream\\ntasks, while the low-capacity head is finetuned for the specific task. In our physics-informed approach,\\nSSL serves to constrain rather than enhance flexibility. We first pretrain the low-capacity head to\\ndistill the laws of physics, and then finetune the high-capacity backbone model to learn a mapping that\\naligns with the frozen head to produce the observed physiological variables x while respecting the\\nphysical laws. In doing so, we force the backbone model to learn a mapping from the measurement y\\nto the physical parameters \\u03b8.\\nThe concept of distilling a physics-based dynamic model into a data-driven one draws from engi-\\nneering methodologies that develop surrogate models to simplify computational complexity using\\nsimulated data (e.g., (58)). This data-driven approach mirrors other supervised learning generative\\nstrategies for solving inverse problems or system identification with known dynamics in control\\ntheory (51; 78). Importantly, physics-informed SSL scales efficiently with increasingly complex and\\nhigher fidelity physical models, as its computational requirements involve one offline process (Eq.\\n(10) and (11)) once the synthetic data is acquired.\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

They are particularly useful in modeling dynamical systems,\\nwhich consist of multiple interdependent components that evolve over time [3, 4]. Take, for example,\\nthe epidemiological dynamics of a contagious disease containing various components, including\\ninfection rates, recovery rates, population movement, and intervention strategies. DTs can integrate\\nthese factors to simulate future outcomes (e.g. predict disease spread), understand system changes\\n(e.g. examining shifts in disease dynamics for varying demographics), and evaluate the impact of\\ncontrol measures (e.g. to curb disease transmission) [5, 6].\\nDesiderata. A notable differentiator between DTs and general machine learning (ML) models\\nis the emphasis on generalization. DTs are designed to simulate completely unseen scenarios or\\ninterventions at inference time. Therefore, a crucial consideration is \\u25b6[P1] out-of-distribution\\n\\u2217Equal contributions; authors listed in randomized order.\\n2Code is available at https:\\/\\/github.com\\/samholt\\/HDTwinGen.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\ngeneralization: the ability to generalize to state-action distributions beyond those observed during\\ntraining. This challenge is often compounded by the scarcity of observational data available to accu-\\nrately learn dynamics, highlighting the importance of \\u25b6[P2] sample-efficient learning. Additionally,\\nthe model should be \\u25b6[P3] evolvable: capable of efficiently adapting (i.e. with minimal retraining)\\nto changes in the underlying system dynamics. This is particularly crucial in healthcare domains,\\nsuch as epidemiological modeling and treatment planning, where DTs are regularly updated to\\nreflect fundamental changes in disease transmission patterns (caused by viral mutations, vaccination\\ncoverage) or evolving drug resistance mechanisms, often with minimal additional data of emergent\\ndynamics [6, 7].\\nExisting approaches for creating DTs primarily utilize two approaches: mechanistic models or ML-\\nbased neural models. Mechanistic models, denoted as fmech, are closed-form equations grounded\\nin domain knowledge such as biological or physical principles. They offer high accuracy and\\ngeneralization given sufficient domain understanding but are limited in their ability to model systems\\nwhere scientific knowledge is incomplete [8, 9]. Of related note, techniques have been introduced\\nto discover governing equations directly from data, but face challenges in scaling to more complex\\nproblem settings [10, 11]. Conversely, neural approaches, fneural, leverage neural networks (NN) to\\nlearn DTs directly from data, often requiring minimal knowledge [12, 13, 14, 15]. Such models are\\neffective given sufficient training data that provides adequate coverage of state-action distributions,\\nbut struggle in data-scarce settings and are difficult to evolve to reflect changing conditions due to\\ntheir overparameterized, monolithic nature.\\nKey considerations. Informed by this context, Hybrid Digtal Twins (HDTwins) combine the strengths\\nof both approaches through compositions of neural and mechanistic components, i.e. f = fmech \\u25e6\\nfneural. Here, fmech symbolically incorporates domain-grounded priors, improving generalization and\\nregularization while simplifying the complexity of patterns that have to be learned by the neural\\ncomponent. In other terms, fneural complements the mechanistic component by modeling complex\\ntemporal patterns in regions where the mechanistic model might be oversimplified or incomplete.\\nConsequently, HDTwins can more accurately and robustly capture system dynamics, particularly in\\nsettings with (limited) empirical data and (partial) domain knowledge.\\nConceptually, hybrid modeling involves two stages: model specification, determining the model\\nstructure (e.g. neural architecture, symbolic equations), and model parameterization, estimating\\nmodel parameters (e.g. neural weights, coefficients). This process, with model specification in\\nparticular, has traditionally relied heavily on human expertise to craft problem-specific models\\n[16, 17, 18, 19]. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of automatically designing hybrid models\\nwith minimal expert involvement, which would significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability\\nof model development. This task is challenging, as it requires searching for optimal specification\\nand corresponding parameters within a vast combinatorial model space [20, 21]. To address this, we\\nintroduce HDTwinGen, a novel evolutionary framework that autonomously and efficiently designs\\nHDTwins. At a high level, our method represents hybrid model specifications in code and leverages\\nlarge language models (LLMs) for their domain knowledge, contextual understanding, and learning\\ncapabilities to propose symbolically represented models and search the model space [22, 23, 24].\\nThis is coupled with offline optimization tools to empirically estimate model parameters from training\\ndata. More specifically, HDTwinGen utilizes two LLM agents: the modeling agent, whose task is\\nto generate novel model specifications, and the evaluation agent, which analyzes performance and\\nprovides targeted recommendations for improvement. Through multiple iterations, HDTwinGen\\nefficiently evolves better performing hybrid models with informed modifications.\\nContributions:\\n1 Conceptually, we present the first work in automated hybrid model design, jointly\\noptimizing model specification and parameterization of hybrid digital twins. 2 Technically, we\\nintroduce HDTwinGen, a novel evolutionary framework employing LLMs and offline optimization\\ntools to propose, evaluate, and iteratively enhance hybrid models. 3 Empirically, we demonstrate\\nthat our method learns more accurate DTs, achieving \\u25b6better out-of-distribution generalization, \\u25b6\\nsample-efficient learning, and \\u25b6increased flexibility for modular evolvability.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Digital Twins of Dynamical Systems\",\"section_content\":\"Digital Twins of Dynamical Systems\\nA dynamical system S := (X, U, \\u03a6) is a tuple of its dX -dimensional state space X \\u2286RdX , an\\n(optional) dU-dimensional action space U \\u2286RdU , and a dynamics model \\u03a6.
