{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Discussion\\nWe present NAVSIM, a framework for non-reactive AV simulation. We address shortcomings of\\nexisting driving benchmarks and propose standardized but configurable simulation-based metrics for\\nbenchmarking driving policies. For accessibility, we provide challenging scenario splits and simple\\ndata curation methods. We show that our evaluation protocol is better aligned to closed-loop driving,\\nbenchmark an established set of end-to-end planning baselines from CARLA and nuScenes, and\\npresent the results of our inaugural competition. We hope that NAVSIM can serve as an accessible\\ntoolkit for AV researchers that bridges the gap between simulated and real-world driving.\\nNeed for Reactive Simulation. While we show improvements over displacement errors, several\\naspects of driving remain unaddressed by evaluation in NAVSIM. A high PDMS does not always imply\\na high CLS, since our framework does not consider reactiveness or the compounding accumulation\\n2https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/spaces\\/AGC2024-P\\/e2e-driving-navsim\\n9\\nof errors in closed-loop simulation. Moreover, as in CLS, rear-end collisions into the ego vehicle\\nare currently not classified as \\\"at-fault\\\", resulting in little importance given to the scene behind the\\nvehicle in NAVSIM. In the future, data-driven sensor or traffic simulation could alleviate these issues,\\nonce such methods mature and become computationally tractable. Given these limitations of the\\ncurrent framework, we strongly encourage the use of graphics-based closed-loop simulators, such as\\nCARLA [17], as complementary benchmarks to NAVSIM when developing planning algorithms.\\nSimplicity of Metrics. As a starting point, NAVSIM offers both interpretable open-loop subscores\\nand a scalarizing function, which lets us provide a final score and ranking for participants in the\\nchallenge. In the future, multi-objective evaluation and other aggregation functions might be required.\\nMoreover, closed-loop metrics also face problems, i.e., PDMS inherits several weaknesses of nuPlan\\u2019s\\nCLS. Both scores do not regard certain traffic rules (e.g., stop-sign or traffic light compliance) or\\nconcepts such as transit and fuel efficiency. In the future, we aim to improve the subscore definitions\\n(e.g. the at-fault collision logic) and add more subscores during aggregation.\\nCall for Datasets. Certain limitations of the nuPlan dataset persist in NAVSIM, such as missing\\nclasses in the label space, minor errors in camera parameters, or noise in vehicle poses and 3D\\nannotations. Our analysis might favor methods that are robust to such inconsistencies. In addition,\\nthe lack of road elevation data in our representation presents a challenge for integrating scenarios\\nbased on 3D map annotations. We aim to support more datasets in the future, and advocate for more\\nopen dataset releases by the community for accelerating progress in autonomous driving.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the ERC Starting Grant LEGO-3D (850533), the DFG EXC number\\n2064\\/1 - project number 390727645, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research:\\nT\\u00fcbingen AI Center, FKZ: 01IS18039A and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs\\nand Climate Action within the project NXT GEN AI METHODS.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"5.2 Manual Evaluation\",\"section_content\":\"To further investigate the performance of the models, we also conduct a manual evaluation of a subset of the results. As a sample, we extract the frst 20 predicates that occur in the target text. We frst assess how the models perform on this subset within the default lemma-constrained setting (guess_tot). We ignore the number of attempts before retrieving the correct lemma, as it is already refected by evaluation metrics, and focus on the assignments of synsets given a shared lemma. Results are presented in Table 1, to be interpreted in the following way: 1\\/2 means that two synset candidates are retrieved by the model (given a constrained lemma), and the frst out of the two is the correct one based on manual annotation. $_{1=2\\/2}$ implies that two candidates are retrieved, and that they are identical and both correct, while $\\\\theta\\/{\\\\mathfrak{n}}$ means that none of the n retrieved candidates is correct. $1\\\\,{=}\\\\,n{=}5\\/5$ corresponds to a situation where all fve retrieved candidates are identical and correct.\\nIn addition to the evaluation settings based on lemma constraint, we then design an artifcially simplifed setting to analyze how PLMs behave when retrieving the correct synset without being limited by shared lemma. As mentioned when presenting the guess_seen evaluation criterion, in this controlled setup we focus only on lemma-synset pairs which occur in the reference corpus, excluding from the evaluation all those that do not meet this requirement. A similar setup should allow to investigate actual performances without being overly affected by data scarcity. In principle, it should be possible to retrieve tokens sharing the same synset regardless of whether they share the same lemma, as explained through the example of pario, facio, instituo, all sharing the synset v#00406243 (Section 4). However, Figure 2 highlights how the number of attempts before a correct guess is still very high. The pattern is similar to what already observed when constraining on lemma, with PhilTa performing the worst. Yet, here PhilBERTa and multilingual BERT are inverted, with the latter resulting to be the model that on average needs the lowest number of attempts before a correct one.\\nThe analysis of results shows that the models\\u2019 performances do not differ substantially one from another in the defned setting. Lemmas for which none of the retrieved candidates are correct (e.g. 0\\/5 in the table) can be explained by the fact that the sense they have been manually annotated with never occurs in the reference corpus, either at all or in association to that specifc lemma. It is e.g. the case of credo \\u2018to believe\\u2019 and moveo \\u2018to move\\u2019, despite both being quite frequent verbs. The same happens with diffdo \\u2018to distrust\\u2019; the sense observed in the target corpus (v#00687926, \\\"regard as untrustworthy; regard with suspicion; have no faith or confdence in\\\") never occurs in the reference corpus. In this way, even a classifcation that should be relatively simple -\\u2014 like the binary classifcation of diffdo, for which only two senses are stored in Latin WordNet \\u2013 fails. In the case of permota, from permoveo \\u2018to stir up\\u2019, we can observe the similarity of defnitions that was already discussed in Section 3, as the sense defnitions of retrieved candidates are highly similar: \\\"move deeply\\\" and \\\"disturb in mind or make uneasy or cause to be worried or alarmed\\\" (retrieved twice).\\nThe case of gerere, from gero \\u2018to manage\\u2019, offers interesting insights as well, since all the fve retrieved candidates are assigned the same sense \\\"direct the course of; manage or control\\\". Such cases of candidates leading to the same sense suggestion could probably be grouped, in order to investigate whether additional and different senses are retrieved after the main one; then, retrieved sense suggestions could possibly be weighted by the number of times they are proposed. However, in this specifc case in the reference corpus we can fnd ten occurrences of the verb gero, all assigned that same sense. The effect of frequency can be observed with gero in the number of total guesses before a token with the same lemma is retrieved: 459 for PhilBERTa and 304 for mBERT, considerably lower than the average number (Figure 1). Hapax legomena, marked as such in Table 1, have been set aside also in the manual evaluation, as the lemma-constrained setting inevitably prevents the retrieval of any candidate.\\n\\nOverall, what emerges from Table 1 is that no PLM consistently outperforms the others, with all models exhibiting similar performance within the defned setting.18\\nWithin the proposed manual assessment, we also evaluate the sub-task of synset retrieval. Let us take again the token permota19 as an example. mBERT and PhilBERTa, the two models that have proved to perform better, take respectively 328 and 1168 guesses before retrieving the correct synset. Their performances differ substantially here, with mBERT outperforming PhilBERTa by much. Nonetheless, the synset defnitions of the frst 5 out of the 328 candidates suggested by mBERT are suffcient to highlight the absence of a clear, reliable rationale in such retrieval, as they appear uncorrelated: \\\"give a certain impression or gave a certain outward aspect\\\", \\\"enter or assume a certain state or condition\\\", \\\"from a critical opinion of\\\", habitually do something (used only in past tense)\\\", \\\"have with oneself; have on one\\u2019s person\\\".\\nMoreover, deriving discernible patterns from the outputs of PLMs presents considerable challenges (see Figure 3). In the case of permota, beside performances by mBERT and PhilBERTa, we observe the number of guesses by PhilTa and Latin BERT amounting to 592 and 1240 respectively \\u2013 not totally consistently with the pattern observed e.g. in Figure 1. However, if we take into account the second token of the target corpus, i.e. peperat from pario with the meaning of \\\"cause to happen, occur or exist\\\", the number of suggestions before retrieving the correct sense does not mirror what has been observed so far (PhilBERTa: 15 suggested candidates; Latin BERT: 28; mBERT: 68; PhilTa: 324). Once again, it is hard to interpret why specifc senses associated to candidate suggestions are retrieved. For instance, mBERT retrieves the following: 1) \\\"be willing to concede\\\", 2) \\\"spur on\\\", 3)\\\"impose a penalty on; infict punishment on\\\", 4) \\\"confess to a punishable or reprehensible deed, usually under pressure\\\", 5) \\\"take or capture by force\\\". PhilBERTa, i.e. the model with lowest retrieval score in this specifc case, outputs these candidates: 1) \\\"make a solicitation or entreaty for something; request urgently or persistently\\\", 2) \\\"order, request, or command to come\\\", 3) \\\"get to know or become aware of, usually accidentally\\\", 4) \\\"assign a specifed (usually proper name) proper name to\\\", 5) \\\"decide with authority\\\". Not only their similarity to the actually assigned one (\\\"cause to happen, occur or exist\\\") is irrelevant, but the two sets of candidates do not look mutually similar in any way.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

As a sample, we extract the frst 20 predicates that occur in the target text. We frst assess how the models perform on this subset within the default lemma-constrained setting (guess_tot). We ignore the number of attempts before retrieving the correct lemma, as it is already refected by evaluation metrics, and focus on the assignments of synsets given a shared lemma. Results are presented in Table 1, to be interpreted in the following way: 1\\/2 means that two synset candidates are retrieved by the model (given a constrained lemma), and the frst out of the two is the correct one based on manual annotation. $_{1=2\\/2}$ implies that two candidates are retrieved, and that they are identical and both correct, while $\\\\theta\\/{\\\\mathfrak{n}}$ means that none of the n retrieved candidates is correct. $1\\\\,{=}\\\\,n{=}5\\/5$ corresponds to a situation where all fve retrieved candidates are identical and correct.\\nIn addition to the evaluation settings based on lemma constraint, we then design an artifcially simplifed setting to analyze how PLMs behave when retrieving the correct synset without being limited by shared lemma. As mentioned when presenting the guess_seen evaluation criterion, in this controlled setup we focus only on lemma-synset pairs which occur in the reference corpus, excluding from the evaluation all those that do not meet this requirement. A similar setup should allow to investigate actual performances without being overly affected by data scarcity. In principle, it should be possible to retrieve tokens sharing the same synset regardless of whether they share the same lemma, as explained through the example of pario, facio, instituo, all sharing the synset v#00406243 (Section 4). However, Figure 2 highlights how the number of attempts before a correct guess is still very high. The pattern is similar to what already observed when constraining on lemma, with PhilTa performing the worst. Yet, here PhilBERTa and multilingual BERT are inverted, with the latter resulting to be the model that on average needs the lowest number of attempts before a correct one.\\nThe analysis of results shows that the models\\u2019 performances do not differ substantially one from another in the defned setting. Lemmas for which none of the retrieved candidates are correct (e.g. 0\\/5 in the table) can be explained by the fact that the sense they have been manually annotated with never occurs in the reference corpus, either at all or in association to that specifc lemma. It is e.g. the case of credo \\u2018to believe\\u2019 and moveo \\u2018to move\\u2019, despite both being quite frequent verbs. The same happens with diffdo \\u2018to distrust\\u2019; the sense observed in the target corpus (v#00687926, \\\"regard as untrustworthy; regard with suspicion; have no faith or confdence in\\\") never occurs in the reference corpus. In this way, even a classifcation that should be relatively simple -\\u2014 like the binary classifcation of diffdo, for which only two senses are stored in Latin WordNet \\u2013 fails. In the case of permota, from permoveo \\u2018to stir up\\u2019, we can observe the similarity of defnitions that was already discussed in Section 3, as the sense defnitions of retrieved candidates are highly similar: \\\"move deeply\\\" and \\\"disturb in mind or make uneasy or cause to be worried or alarmed\\\" (retrieved twice).\\nThe case of gerere, from gero \\u2018to manage\\u2019, offers interesting insights as well, since all the fve retrieved candidates are assigned the same sense \\\"direct the course of; manage or control\\\". Such cases of candidates leading to the same sense suggestion could probably be grouped, in order to investigate whether additional and different senses are retrieved after the main one; then, retrieved sense suggestions could possibly be weighted by the number of times they are proposed. However, in this specifc case in the reference corpus we can fnd ten occurrences of the verb gero, all assigned that same sense. The effect of frequency can be observed with gero in the number of total guesses before a token with the same lemma is retrieved: 459 for PhilBERTa and 304 for mBERT, considerably lower than the average number (Figure 1). Hapax legomena, marked as such in Table 1, have been set aside also in the manual evaluation, as the lemma-constrained setting inevitably prevents the retrieval of any candidate.\\n\\nOverall, what emerges from Table 1 is that no PLM consistently outperforms the others, with all models exhibiting similar performance within the defned setting.18\\nWithin the proposed manual assessment, we also evaluate the sub-task of synset retrieval. Let us take again the token permota19 as an example. mBERT and PhilBERTa, the two models that have proved to perform better, take respectively 328 and 1168 guesses before retrieving the correct synset. Their performances differ substantially here, with mBERT outperforming PhilBERTa by much. Nonetheless, the synset defnitions of the frst 5 out of the 328 candidates suggested by mBERT are suffcient to highlight the absence of a clear, reliable rationale in such retrieval, as they appear uncorrelated: \\\"give a certain impression or gave a certain outward aspect\\\", \\\"enter or assume a certain state or condition\\\", \\\"from a critical opinion of\\\", habitually do something (used only in past tense)\\\", \\\"have with oneself; have on one\\u2019s person\\\".\\nMoreover, deriving discernible patterns from the outputs of PLMs presents considerable challenges (see Figure 3). In the case of permota, beside performances by mBERT and PhilBERTa, we observe the number of guesses by PhilTa and Latin BERT amounting to 592 and 1240 respectively \\u2013 not totally consistently with the pattern observed e.g. in Figure 1. However, if we take into account the second token of the target corpus, i.e. peperat from pario with the meaning of \\\"cause to happen, occur or exist\\\", the number of suggestions before retrieving the correct sense does not mirror what has been observed so far (PhilBERTa: 15 suggested candidates; Latin BERT: 28; mBERT: 68; PhilTa: 324). Once again, it is hard to interpret why specifc senses associated to candidate suggestions are retrieved. For instance, mBERT retrieves the following: 1) \\\"be willing to concede\\\", 2) \\\"spur on\\\", 3)\\\"impose a penalty on; infict punishment on\\\", 4) \\\"confess to a punishable or reprehensible deed, usually under pressure\\\", 5) \\\"take or capture by force\\\". PhilBERTa, i.e. the model with lowest retrieval score in this specifc case, outputs these candidates: 1) \\\"make a solicitation or entreaty for something; request urgently or persistently\\\", 2) \\\"order, request, or command to come\\\", 3) \\\"get to know or become aware of, usually accidentally\\\", 4) \\\"assign a specifed (usually proper name) proper name to\\\", 5) \\\"decide with authority\\\". Not only their similarity to the actually assigned one (\\\"cause to happen, occur or exist\\\") is irrelevant, but the two sets of candidates do not look mutually similar in any way.\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
