{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"DATASETS WITH DIVERSE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IMITATION LEARNING\\nIn this section, we present a novel suite of tasks known as D3IL - Datasets with Diverse Demon-\\nstrations for Imitation Learning. We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24.

Leveraging human expertise, IL algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in\\ntraining robots to perform a wide range of complex tasks with finesse (Brohan et al., 2022; Zhao\\net al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). However, learning from human data is challenging due to the\\ninherent diversity in human behavior (Grauman et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2020).

Furthermore,\\nthe majority of existing studies do not provide metrics to quantitatively measure a model\\u2019s ability to\\nreplicate diverse behaviors, often relying solely on qualitative analysis (Shafiullah et al., 2022).\\nTo address these challenges, this work introduces benchmark environments and the corresponding\\nDatasets with Diverse Human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning (D3IL).

We have designed these datasets to encompass the rich-\\nness and variability inherent in human behavior, offering more realistic and challenging benchmark\\nscenarios for imitation learning.

Using all these insights, our\\nstudy will inform the design and advancement of future imitation learning algorithms.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"DATASETS WITH DIVERSE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IMITATION LEARNING\\nIn this section, we present a novel suite of tasks known as D3IL - Datasets with Diverse Demon-\\nstrations for Imitation Learning. We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

However, privacy risks go beyond memorization [5].\\nAs LMs are increasingly applied to complex everyday tasks, private information can be easily exposed\\nat inference time. These models may share such information in their generated texts, potentially\\nviolating social norms specific to the context [13]. Accordingly, prior work has focused on testing\\nattribute inference or privacy-sensitive prompt injection, yet lacks systematic studies of LM privacy\\nrisks [48, 52]. The most relevant work is ConfAIde [33], which evaluates whether LMs can reason\\nabout contextual privacy. However, ConfAIde primarily employs probing questions and only covers\\na single application of meeting summary and action-item generation with 20 test cases. Thus, it\\nremains unclear whether LMs could unintentionally leak sensitive information presented at inference\\ntime in agentic applications. In this work, we propose PrivacyLens to study this emerging LM privacy\\nleakage risk.\\nTable 1: Comparison of PrivacyLens with previous work on\\nevaluating LM privacy. \\u201cUnintentional Leakage\\u201d refers to\\ndata leaks without malicious attackers. \\u201cAction-Based Eval\\u201d\\nrefers to evaluating the actions performed by LM agents.\\nExposure\\nTime\\nLeakage\\nType\\nAction-Based\\nEval?\\nEvaluating MIA on LM [10]\\nTraining\\nIntentional\\nNo\\nLM Extraction Benchmark [1]\\nTraining\\nIntentional\\nNo\\nDecoding Trust [52] \\u00a78.1\\nTraining\\nIntentional\\nNo\\nDecoding Trust [52] \\u00a78.2,\\u00a78.3\\nInference\\nIntentional\\nNo\\nConfAIde [33]\\nInference\\nUnintentional\\nNo\\nPrivacyLens (Ours)\\nInference\\nUnintentional\\nYes\\nEvaluating Language Model Agents\\nRecent advancements in LMs have\\nled to their rapid expansion in agent-\\nbased applications. Current LM agent\\nbenchmarks typically evaluate their\\ncapabilities across various domains,\\nincluding web environments [55, 58,\\n9], game playing [54], coding [23, 28,\\n45], social interactions [59], etc. [19,\\n30, 44]. However, in addition to high\\ntask completion rates, an ideal LM\\nagent should also consider the conse-\\nquences of its actions when complet-\\ning tasks on behalf of the user. To this\\nend, Naihin et al. [35] and Yuan et al. [57] manually craft risky agent trajectories to assess whether\\nLMs can be used to monitor or judge unsafe actions of LM agents. This manual approach is labor-\\nintensive and prone to becoming outdated due to issues of data contamination. Addressing this, Ruan\\net al. [41] proposes ToolEmu, an LM-based emulation framework designed to evaluate tool-use LM\\nagents. Despite these developments, to the best of our knowledge, no existing research focuses on\\nevaluating LM agent actions from the privacy perspective.\\nLanguage Model Assisted Evaluation\\nGiven the high costs and limited coverage of human-\\nannotated datasets, previous studies have leveraged the instruction-following ability of LMs to\\ngenerate test cases for assisting the evaluation of LMs themselves [17, 12, 15]. More recent work\\nfurther develops data construction framework using LMs to discover novel test cases [40], facilitate\\nred teaming [39], and understand social reasoning in LMs [14]. Drawing inspiration from these\\nadvancements, our work introduces a procedural data construction pipeline that utilizes LMs to\\nconstruct vignettes and LM agent trajectories from privacy-sensitive seeds.\\n3\\nPrivacyLens\\nIn this section, we define the risk model that serves as the focus of our evaluation (\\u00a73.1), the Priva-\\ncyLens framework, which comprises a procedural data construction pipeline (\\u00a73.2) and multi-level\\nevaluation of LM privacy norm awareness (\\u00a73.3).

PrivacyLens starts with contextual privacy-\\nsensitive seeds (A). It extends each seed into a vignette (B) with more details through template-based\\ngeneration. The seed and vignette will be used to guide the emulator in sandbox simulation to get an\\nLM agent trajectory (C). We employ the Surgery Kit module to improve the vignette and trajectory\\nquality based on unit tests and LM refinement.\\na sender, who provides an instruction i that involves sharing information with a recipient (e.g., \\u201cHelp\\nme reply to an email\\u201d), but may underspecify the appropriateness of sharing certain information; (2)\\na recipient, who the sender specifies to receive the information; (3) an LM agent, which executes\\ni through a sequence of tool use actions a, represented as {a1, o1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , an\\u22121, on\\u22121, an}, where o\\ndenotes the observations from the environment. Notably, unlike traditional risk models, our risk\\nmodel does not involve malicious actors. The privacy leakage arises when a piece of information\\ngathered in the agent trajectory, {a1, o1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , an\\u22121, on\\u22121}, is shared with the recipient in the agent\\u2019s\\nfinal action an, and the information flow violates privacy norms.\\n3.2\\nData Construction Pipeline\\nCollecting Contextual Privacy Seeds\\nTo quantify the privacy norm awareness of LMs in action, we\\nstart with privacy-sensitive seeds that encapsulate a privacy-norm-violating scenario [18]. Drawing\\nfrom the Contextual Integrity theory, we define the privacy-sensitive seed S with a 5-tuple: (1) data\\ntype, the attribute or information type; (2) data subject, the subject of the information that is being\\ntransferred; (3) data sender, the sender of the information; (4) data recipient, the recipient of the\\ninformation; (5) transmission principle, the information transmission method or condition imposed.\\nThe seed S delineates potentially inappropriate information transmissions and specifying all five\\nelements makes the seed contextual, as altering any single element could shift the expected privacy\\nnorms (see Appendix B.2 for examples).\\nExtending Contextual Seed into Vignette\\nAlthough our theory-based schema enables the privacy-\\nsensitive seeds to be contextual, these seeds have limited details. For instance, the seed in Figure 1\\ndoes not specify the circumstances under which John emails his manager. To evaluate whether LMs\\ncan identify potentially sensitive data transmissions in detailed scenarios, we extend the seed into a\\nvignette V, i.e., a short story, using a template-based generation method with GPT-4. The vignette\\n(Figure 2 (B)) includes more details to reflect the real-world complexity.\\nSince vignettes are extended from privacy-sensitive seeds, direct generations from GPT-4 often\\ninclude terms explicitly indicating sensitivity, e.g., \\u201csensitive\\u201d, \\u201cprivate\\u201d, \\u201cconfidential\\u201d. However,\\nprivate issues in daily communication are typically implicit and nuanced. To mirror such subtleties,\\nwe require that the generated vignettes exclude these restricted words. To achieve this, we introduce\\na Surgery Kit module that refines model outputs to meet specific criteria established by unit tests. As\\noutlined in Algorithm 1, this module takes in the initial output alongside a set of unit tests, and uses\\n4\\nan LM to refine the text based on the repair instruction associated with the failed test. In vignette\\ngeneration, we define a deterministic keyword detection function as the unit test and instruct the LM\\nto remove these keywords when the test fails.\\nAlgorithm 1: Surgery Kit Module\\nInput: Original output x, model M,\\nunit tests U = {u1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , uk},\\ncorresponding refining\\ninstructions I = {i1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , ik},\\nmaximum iterations n\\nOutput: Refined output \\u02c6\\nx, success flag s\\n1 for i = 1 to n do\\n2\\np \\u2190true\\n3\\nfor j = 1 to k do\\n4\\nif not uj(x) then\\n5\\np \\u2190false\\n6\\nx \\u2190refine(M, x, ij)\\n7\\nif p then\\n8\\nreturn x, true\\n9 for j = 1 to k do\\n10\\nif not uj(x) then\\n11\\nreturn x, false\\n12 return x, true\\nConstructing Executable Agent Trajectory\\nTo\\ncollect agent trajectories at scale, we develop a\\nsandbox environment leveraging ToolEmu [41].\\nWithin the sandbox, the LM agent can interact\\nwith a suite of tools, e.g., calendar, email, social\\nmedia, personal notebook, etc. (see Appendix C\\nfor details), by generating a series of actions a\\ntowards fulfilling the user instruction i. The ob-\\nservations o from these tool interactions are gen-\\nerated by a GPT-4 emulator, eliminating the need\\nto rely on real user data within the sandbox. Af-\\nter multiple interactions between the LM agent\\nand the sandbox emulator, we obtain an agent tra-\\njectory {a1, o1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , an\\u22121, on\\u22121, an}, which ulti-\\nmately completes i with the final action an. To pre-\\npare this trajectory for evaluation across different\\nLMs, we remove the final action an (e.g., sending\\nan email or message) where data transfer occurs.\\nThe whole process results in an executable trajec-\\ntory T = {a1, o1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , an\\u22121, on\\u22121} as a compo-\\nnent of each data point in PrivacyLens.\\nTo enhance worst-case evaluation efficiency, we\\nincorporate risk-triggering elements into trajectory\\nconstruction. Based on our risk model (\\u00a73.1), we use GPT-4 to generate an underspecified user\\ninstruction i given each privacy-sensitive seed S and its corresponding vignette V. The sandbox\\nemulator is instructed to generate observations based on S and V, thus creating adversarial scenarios\\nthat are likely to expose privacy risks. To ensure these agent trajectories do not have placeholders and\\nreflect the intended privacy-sensitive contexts, we again utilize the Surgery Kit module. This module\\nedits each o locally to eliminate placeholders and globally refines T to enhance its alignment with S.\\n3.3\\nMulti-Level Evaluation\\nPrivacyLens evaluates LM privacy awareness in two ways, with S, V and T in each data point:\\nProbing in Question-Answering Format\\nWe first assess LMs on their ability to identify sensitive\\ndata transmission through probing in QA format. For S and V of each data point, we prompt the\\nLM to answer \\u201cIs it acceptable for {data sender} to share {data subject}\\u2019s {data type} with {data\\nrecipient} by {transmission principle}?\\u201d This probing question is taken from Shvartzshnaider et al.\\n[47], which was originally used to survey human privacy expectations. For the agent trajectory T , we\\nformulate the probing question by emphasizing the agent is sending information on behalf of the user,\\nas exemplified in Figure 3. Since S is privacy-sensitive and V, T are constructed from it, we expect\\nthe LM to answer \\u201cNo\\u201d for all these probing questions. We use accuracy as the metric.\\nEvaluating LMs in Action with Agent Setup\\nNext, we evaluate LMs in action with agent\\ntrajectories. For each trajectory T , we prompt the LM to generate the final action, denoted as aT , to\\ncomplete the corresponding user instruction. We evaluate whether aT leaks any information about\\nthe data type in S. To streamline the evaluation process, we extract a list of sensitive information\\nitems, I(T , S) = {i1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , im}, from trajectory T based on its corresponding seed S. We build an\\nLM-based few-shot classifier f to judge whether each information item can be inferred from the\\naction. aT leaks the information if \\u2203t \\u2208{1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , m}, it can be inferred from aT . The leakage rate\\n(LR) on the evaluation dataset D is defined as the percentage of aT that leaks the information:\\nLR =\\nP\\n(S,V,T )\\u2208D 1{S f(it, aT ))|t = 1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , m}\\n|D|\\n.\\n(1)\\n5\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"METHOD\\nWe present PolyVoice, an innovative language model-based framework for speech-to-speech trans-\\nlation, catering to both written and unwritten languages. Our proposed framework leverages discrete\\nunits, acquired through self-supervised training techniques such as HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), serv-\\ning as an intermediary representation bridging the source and target speech modalities. PolyVoice\\nprovides a comprehensive framework consisting of two main components: a speech-to-unit trans-\\nlation (S2UT) front-end, facilitating the conversion of source language speech into target language\\nunits, and a unit-to-speech (U2S) back-end, skillfully synthesizing translated speech while preserv-\\ning the personalized style of the source speaker.

The discretized units are then merged by removing consecutive duplicated units.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nUnit-based cross-lingual language model (U-XLM)\\nWe denote the training sample consisting of\\nunits of speech in source language and target language as <src unit, tgt unit>. Within the encoder-\\ndecoder architecture, the encoder takes the source units as input, while the decoder generates pre-\\ndictions for the target units. To facilitate the generation of cross-lingual units, a straightforward ap-\\nproach involves utilizing simple prompts to construct training samples for natural language from unit\\npairs. For instance, one can create prompts like: \\u201cTranslate [src lang] unit {src unit} to [tgt lang]\\nunit: {tgt unit}\\u201d. In addition to the direct transformation prompt, we can also instruct the model to\\ngenerate intermediate steps similar to the cascaded systems in the chain of thought prompting (Wei\\net al., 2022) manner.\\nTraining\\nTo achieve competitive performance in training the U-XLM model, a large amount of\\ndata is crucial. However, obtaining supervised data, specifically cross-lingual unit pairs, is often\\nlimited in real-world scenarios. While auxiliary models can generate pseudo labels, such as synthe-\\nsizing the target speech using the TTS model, direct training with supervised data is preferred.\\nTo overcome the challenge of limited data availability, prior research has incorporated additional\\nloss functions into the encoder-decoder architecture using multitask learning (Jia et al., 2022a; Lee\\net al., 2022a). In our work, we leverage the power of language modeling to address this issue in\\na more straightforward manner, allowing for the utilization of diverse data sources like automatic\\nspeech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) data.\\nIn Table 1, we demonstrate how we use different prompts to create training samples for different\\ntypes of data sources. By employing parameter sharing and simplifying the design of auxiliary\\nobjectives, we train the model using these prompts. This approach also enables the direct utilization\\nof unlabeled text and speech data. Consequently, the model implicitly enhances the alignment of the\\nrepresentation space between speech units and text.\\n3.2\\nUNIT-TO-SPEECH SYNTHESIS (U2S)\\nUnit-to-speech language model (U-SLM)\\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the U-SLM leverages the\\nsemantic units predicted by U-XLM and generates the codec units which incorporate the speak-\\ning style of source speaker. Similar to VALL-E X, U-SLM encompasses both an autoregressive\\nmodel and a non-autoregressive model. However, instead of conventional phonemes, we employ\\ndiscretized semantic units in our approach.\\nSoundStream codec\\nWe employ SoundStream (Zeghidour et al., 2021), a neural audio codec,\\nto generate embeddings of acoustic tokens. To ensure optimal performance, we re-implement the\\nSoundStream with a hierarchy of 6 vector quantizers and a vocabulary of 1024 symbols. In our\\nconfiguration, the acoustic tokens are produced at a rate of 80Hz for input waveforms sampled\\nat 24 kHz, which results in a significant reduction in the sampling rate, specifically a reduction\\nby a factor of 300 (24000\\/80). Once the U2S model predicts the acoustic tokens represented by\\nthe SoundStream codec, the decoder component of SoundStream reconstructs them back into the\\nwaveform.\\nDuration model\\nThrough empirical observations, we have determined that the duration informa-\\ntion of discretized units is crucial for ensuring stable and natural-sounding synthesized speech. In\\nour approach, we employ an additional LM to predict the durations.\\nIn Figure 1, we illustrate the process of incorporating duration prediction into our framework. The\\nmerged source semantic unit sequence, merged target semantic unit sequence, and the source du-\\nration value sequence (D) are concatenated and provided as a prompt to the duration LM. Subse-\\nquently, the duration LM predicts the target duration value sequence, and each target semantic unit\\nis repeated accordingly based on its predicted duration.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In this appendix we present:\\n\\u2022 More implementation details (Section B).   \\n\\u2022 Data construction details (Section C).   \\n\\u2022 Data statistics (Section D).   \\n\\u2022 Prompts used for instruction generation (Section E).   \\n\\u2022 Discussion on broader impacts (Section F).\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

To understand the importance of dispreferred samples in\\nSTIC, we conduct an ablation study using llava-v1.6-mistral-7b as the base LVLM. We remove\\nthe negative examples from the preference data and only use the positive samples for supervised\\nfine-tuning (SFT), effectively creating an SFT version of STIC. Table 3 shows that omitting the\\ndispreferred samples even leads to a performance drop of 0.6% on LLaVA-Bench, while failing to\\nprovide equally significant improvement as STIC with preference data. This highlights the crucial\\nrole of negative examples in aligning preferences and enabling the model to distinguish between\\nhigh-quality and low-quality responses. By leveraging both positive and negative examples, STIC\\neffectively improves the model\\u2019s performance and generates more preferred outputs.\\nTable 3: Test performance of STIC if we remove negative examples and use positive ones to perform\\nSFT in Stage 1.\\nModel\\nScienceQA\\nTextVQA\\nLLaVA-Bench\\nOriginal\\n68.9\\n60.3\\n77.3\\nw\\/ STIC (positive)\\n71.8\\n63.7\\n76.7\\nw\\/ STIC\\n75.3\\n65.2\\n79.2\\n6k\\n12k\\n30k\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.0\\n1.9\\n3.1\\n3.9\\nFigure 6: Scaling law in STIC.\\nScaling law of STIC. We explore the scaling law of STIC by\\nexpanding the preference data in Stage 1. Using the LLaVA-Bench\\nbenchmark as a case study, we scale up the preference data from\\n6k to 12k MSCOCO images. As depicted in Figure 6, there is an\\nobvious gain on the LLaVA-Bench from 1.9% to 3.1%. This finding\\ndemonstrates that STIC can effectively leverage larger amounts of\\nunlabeled image data and presents a cost-effective solution to the\\nchallenge of acquiring high-quality vision-language data.\\nCorrelation between image distribution and performance gains.\\nTo gain further insight into the effectiveness of STIC across different\\nbenchmarks, we conducted a t-SNE visualization analysis comparing the image distributions of\\nMSCOCO, which we used for preference data construction, with those of four benchmarks: Sci-\\nenceQA, TextVQA, MathVista, and ChartQA (Figure 7). Our analysis revealed a general trend: the\\ngreater the overlap between the MSCOCO image distribution and that of a benchmark, the higher the\\nperformance gain achieved by STIC on that benchmark. This observation held true for ScienceQA\\nand TextVQA, which exhibited substantial distributional overlap with MSCOCO and yielded the\\nhighest performance gains of 6.4% and 4.9%, respectively. Conversely, MathVista, with its diverse\\nimage types and limited overlap with MSCOCO, saw a more modest gain of 2.4%. Interestingly,\\nChartQA was an outlier, achieving a high gain of 5.1% despite minimal overlap with MSCOCO,\\nsuggesting that the improved image comprehension from STIC played a fundamental role in under-\\nstanding and reasoning about the charts. Detailed per-benchmark visualizations and discussions are\\nprovided in Appendix C.2.\\nDiversity in image distribution. Based on the observation on the effect of image distribution\\nin the final performance, we further utilize the Vision Flan dataset (VFLAN\\u2020) for stage 1 image\\ncomprehension self-training.

Leveraging human expertise, IL algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in\\ntraining robots to perform a wide range of complex tasks with finesse (Brohan et al., 2022; Zhao\\net al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). However, learning from human data is challenging due to the\\ninherent diversity in human behavior (Grauman et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2020).

Furthermore,\\nthe majority of existing studies do not provide metrics to quantitatively measure a model\\u2019s ability to\\nreplicate diverse behaviors, often relying solely on qualitative analysis (Shafiullah et al., 2022).\\nTo address these challenges, this work introduces benchmark environments and the corresponding\\nDatasets with Diverse Human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning (D3IL).

However, the demonstrations are generated through motion planning and are hence\\nlacking diversity. Meta-World is another robot learning benchmark with 50 different tasks and a\\nfocus on multi-task reinforcement learning (Yu et al., 2020). Yet, no human demonstrations exists\\nfor these tasks and most tasks typically only have one solution. D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) proposed\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nstandardized environments and datasets for offline reinforcement learning with various tasks. Sev-\\neral other benchmarks specialize in areas such as language-guided multitask learning in simulation\\n(Mees et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023; Gong\\net al., 2023), continual learning (Liu et al., 2023) and diverse multi-task real world skill learning\\n(Walke et al., 2023; Bharadhwaj et al., 2023; Heo et al., 2023). A benchmark with a focus on human\\ndemonstrations is Robomimic (Mandlekar et al., 2021), featuring 8 different task in simulation and\\nreal world environments.

Yet, the tasks where not designed\\nto show diverse behavior and consequently, non of the tested algorithms was designed to capture the\\ndiversity of the behavior.\\nThe benchmarks most closely related to D3IL are Block-Push (Florence et al., 2022; Shafiullah\\net al., 2022), T-Shape Pushing (Florence et al., 2022) and Relay Kitchen Gupta et al. (2019). While\\nBlock-Push has 4 different modalities, the behavior is generated by a scripted policy and is hence\\nlacking variance and fall-back solutions in the dataset. T-Shape tasks are limited to a maximum of\\ntwo modalities. The Relay Kitchen environment (Gupta et al., 2019) contains 7 different tasks with\\nhuman demonstrations that solve four tasks in sequence but does not require closed-loop sensory\\nfeedback. Further, several recent work have shown to achieve nearly optimal performance (Chi\\net al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) on these benchmarks, limiting further progress in these environments.\\nMoreover, none of the mentioned benchmarks offer metrics to evaluate the diversity of the learned\\nbehavior.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"DATASETS WITH DIVERSE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IMITATION LEARNING\\nIn this section, we present a novel suite of tasks known as D3IL - Datasets with Diverse Demon-\\nstrations for Imitation Learning. We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

To understand the importance of dispreferred samples in\\nSTIC, we conduct an ablation study using llava-v1.6-mistral-7b as the base LVLM. We remove\\nthe negative examples from the preference data and only use the positive samples for supervised\\nfine-tuning (SFT), effectively creating an SFT version of STIC. Table 3 shows that omitting the\\ndispreferred samples even leads to a performance drop of 0.6% on LLaVA-Bench, while failing to\\nprovide equally significant improvement as STIC with preference data. This highlights the crucial\\nrole of negative examples in aligning preferences and enabling the model to distinguish between\\nhigh-quality and low-quality responses. By leveraging both positive and negative examples, STIC\\neffectively improves the model\\u2019s performance and generates more preferred outputs.\\nTable 3: Test performance of STIC if we remove negative examples and use positive ones to perform\\nSFT in Stage 1.\\nModel\\nScienceQA\\nTextVQA\\nLLaVA-Bench\\nOriginal\\n68.9\\n60.3\\n77.3\\nw\\/ STIC (positive)\\n71.8\\n63.7\\n76.7\\nw\\/ STIC\\n75.3\\n65.2\\n79.2\\n6k\\n12k\\n30k\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.0\\n1.9\\n3.1\\n3.9\\nFigure 6: Scaling law in STIC.\\nScaling law of STIC. We explore the scaling law of STIC by\\nexpanding the preference data in Stage 1. Using the LLaVA-Bench\\nbenchmark as a case study, we scale up the preference data from\\n6k to 12k MSCOCO images. As depicted in Figure 6, there is an\\nobvious gain on the LLaVA-Bench from 1.9% to 3.1%. This finding\\ndemonstrates that STIC can effectively leverage larger amounts of\\nunlabeled image data and presents a cost-effective solution to the\\nchallenge of acquiring high-quality vision-language data.\\nCorrelation between image distribution and performance gains.\\nTo gain further insight into the effectiveness of STIC across different\\nbenchmarks, we conducted a t-SNE visualization analysis comparing the image distributions of\\nMSCOCO, which we used for preference data construction, with those of four benchmarks: Sci-\\nenceQA, TextVQA, MathVista, and ChartQA (Figure 7). Our analysis revealed a general trend: the\\ngreater the overlap between the MSCOCO image distribution and that of a benchmark, the higher the\\nperformance gain achieved by STIC on that benchmark. This observation held true for ScienceQA\\nand TextVQA, which exhibited substantial distributional overlap with MSCOCO and yielded the\\nhighest performance gains of 6.4% and 4.9%, respectively. Conversely, MathVista, with its diverse\\nimage types and limited overlap with MSCOCO, saw a more modest gain of 2.4%. Interestingly,\\nChartQA was an outlier, achieving a high gain of 5.1% despite minimal overlap with MSCOCO,\\nsuggesting that the improved image comprehension from STIC played a fundamental role in under-\\nstanding and reasoning about the charts. Detailed per-benchmark visualizations and discussions are\\nprovided in Appendix C.2.\\nDiversity in image distribution. Based on the observation on the effect of image distribution\\nin the final performance, we further utilize the Vision Flan dataset (VFLAN\\u2020) for stage 1 image\\ncomprehension self-training. This dataset includes images from 191 diverse vision tasks, providing a\\nbroader spectrum of image types. We ensured a fair comparison by maintaining the same sample\\n\\u2020https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/datasets\\/Vision-Flan\\/vision-flan_191-task_1k\\n9\\nTable 4: Performance of STIC on different stage-1 training images compared with the original LVLM\\nmodel LLaVA-v.16 (Mistral 7B) across vision-language reasoning benchmarks.\\nModel\\nData\\nLLaVA-Bench\\nMM-Vet\\nMMBench\\nComplex\\nConv\\nDetail\\nAll\\nRec\\nOcr\\nKnow\\nGen\\nSpat\\nMath\\nTotal\\nAll\\nLLaVA-v1.6 (7B)\\n-\\n87.4\\n61.3\\n77.8\\n77.3\\n43.1\\n40.6\\n29.6\\n32.5\\n44.7\\n15.4\\n42.2\\n63.7\\nw\\/ STIC\\nCOCO\\n89.1\\n63.7\\n79.5\\n79.2\\n45.7\\n42.5\\n30.4\\n34.9\\n45.1\\n22.7\\n45.0\\n67.8\\nw\\/ STIC\\nVFLAN\\n92.8\\n68.4\\n77.9\\n81.9\\n45.7\\n43.0\\n31.0\\n36.2\\n45.1\\n26.5\\n45.1\\n68.3\\nTable 5: Performance of STIC compared with the original LVLM model LLaVA-v1.6 (Vicuna 13B)\\nacross vision-language reasoning tasks.

Despite the task being\\nfocused on mathematical reasoning, STIC enhanced the model\\u2019s response by improving its image\\ncomprehension capabilities.

This demonstrates the synergistic effect of DaR and the fine-tuning process in STIC.\\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that STIC achieves a substantial average improvement of 2.8% even\\nwithout the DaR prompting method, compared to the base LVLM.\\nTable 2: Test performance of STIC based on llava-v1.6-mistral-7b.

In Figure 5, we illustrate the sequential\\nimprovement in performance of STIC on ScienceQA. While stage\\n1 focuses exclusively on enhancing the perception capabilities of the\\nLVLM, it still notably improves performance on downstream VQA\\ntasks. Building on the improved image comprehension achieved\\nin stage 1, stage 2 introduces an enhanced reasoning process that\\nutilizes the model\\u2019s self-generated image descriptions and results\\nin an even more significant gain. This enhancement further enables\\nthe model to self-augment its prompts with Describe and Respond\\n(DaR), resulting in total the substantial performance gains of 6.4%\\nobserved.\\n8\\n80\\n60\\n40\\n20\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n80\\n60\\n40\\n20\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\nCOCO\\nScienceQA\\nT\\nextVQA\\nMathVista\\nChartQA\\nFigure 7: t-SNE visualization of images from MSCOCO and four benchmarks, each sampling 1k.\\nThe role of dispreferred samples in STIC. To understand the importance of dispreferred samples in\\nSTIC, we conduct an ablation study using llava-v1.6-mistral-7b as the base LVLM. We remove\\nthe negative examples from the preference data and only use the positive samples for supervised\\nfine-tuning (SFT), effectively creating an SFT version of STIC. Table 3 shows that omitting the\\ndispreferred samples even leads to a performance drop of 0.6% on LLaVA-Bench, while failing to\\nprovide equally significant improvement as STIC with preference data. This highlights the crucial\\nrole of negative examples in aligning preferences and enabling the model to distinguish between\\nhigh-quality and low-quality responses. By leveraging both positive and negative examples, STIC\\neffectively improves the model\\u2019s performance and generates more preferred outputs.\\nTable 3: Test performance of STIC if we remove negative examples and use positive ones to perform\\nSFT in Stage 1.\\nModel\\nScienceQA\\nTextVQA\\nLLaVA-Bench\\nOriginal\\n68.9\\n60.3\\n77.3\\nw\\/ STIC (positive)\\n71.8\\n63.7\\n76.7\\nw\\/ STIC\\n75.3\\n65.2\\n79.2\\n6k\\n12k\\n30k\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.0\\n1.9\\n3.1\\n3.9\\nFigure 6: Scaling law in STIC.\\nScaling law of STIC. We explore the scaling law of STIC by\\nexpanding the preference data in Stage 1. Using the LLaVA-Bench\\nbenchmark as a case study, we scale up the preference data from\\n6k to 12k MSCOCO images. As depicted in Figure 6, there is an\\nobvious gain on the LLaVA-Bench from 1.9% to 3.1%. This finding\\ndemonstrates that STIC can effectively leverage larger amounts of\\nunlabeled image data and presents a cost-effective solution to the\\nchallenge of acquiring high-quality vision-language data.\\nCorrelation between image distribution and performance gains.\\nTo gain further insight into the effectiveness of STIC across different\\nbenchmarks, we conducted a t-SNE visualization analysis comparing the image distributions of\\nMSCOCO, which we used for preference data construction, with those of four benchmarks: Sci-\\nenceQA, TextVQA, MathVista, and ChartQA (Figure 7). Our analysis revealed a general trend: the\\ngreater the overlap between the MSCOCO image distribution and that of a benchmark, the higher the\\nperformance gain achieved by STIC on that benchmark. This observation held true for ScienceQA\\nand TextVQA, which exhibited substantial distributional overlap with MSCOCO and yielded the\\nhighest performance gains of 6.4% and 4.9%, respectively. Conversely, MathVista, with its diverse\\nimage types and limited overlap with MSCOCO, saw a more modest gain of 2.4%. Interestingly,\\nChartQA was an outlier, achieving a high gain of 5.1% despite minimal overlap with MSCOCO,\\nsuggesting that the improved image comprehension from STIC played a fundamental role in under-\\nstanding and reasoning about the charts. Detailed per-benchmark visualizations and discussions are\\nprovided in Appendix C.2.\\nDiversity in image distribution. Based on the observation on the effect of image distribution\\nin the final performance, we further utilize the Vision Flan dataset (VFLAN\\u2020) for stage 1 image\\ncomprehension self-training. This dataset includes images from 191 diverse vision tasks, providing a\\nbroader spectrum of image types. We ensured a fair comparison by maintaining the same sample\\n\\u2020https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/datasets\\/Vision-Flan\\/vision-flan_191-task_1k\\n9\\nTable 4: Performance of STIC on different stage-1 training images compared with the original LVLM\\nmodel LLaVA-v.16 (Mistral 7B) across vision-language reasoning benchmarks.\\nModel\\nData\\nLLaVA-Bench\\nMM-Vet\\nMMBench\\nComplex\\nConv\\nDetail\\nAll\\nRec\\nOcr\\nKnow\\nGen\\nSpat\\nMath\\nTotal\\nAll\\nLLaVA-v1.6 (7B)\\n-\\n87.4\\n61.3\\n77.8\\n77.3\\n43.1\\n40.6\\n29.6\\n32.5\\n44.7\\n15.4\\n42.2\\n63.7\\nw\\/ STIC\\nCOCO\\n89.1\\n63.7\\n79.5\\n79.2\\n45.7\\n42.5\\n30.4\\n34.9\\n45.1\\n22.7\\n45.0\\n67.8\\nw\\/ STIC\\nVFLAN\\n92.8\\n68.4\\n77.9\\n81.9\\n45.7\\n43.0\\n31.0\\n36.2\\n45.1\\n26.5\\n45.1\\n68.3\\nTable 5: Performance of STIC compared with the original LVLM model LLaVA-v1.6 (Vicuna 13B)\\nacross vision-language reasoning tasks.

To explore STIC\\u2019s applicability to models with higher representation capacity, we\\nconducted supplementary experiments using LLaVA-v1.6 (Vicuna-13B).

In Figure 8, we show an example output of STIC. Despite the task being\\nfocused on mathematical reasoning, STIC enhanced the model\\u2019s response by improving its image\\ncomprehension capabilities.
