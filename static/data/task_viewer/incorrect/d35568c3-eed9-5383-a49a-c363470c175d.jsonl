{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Models such as ChatGPT and LLaMA have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks. Within this context, addressing mathematical problems has attracted considerable interest from researchers, as it serves as a prominent showcase of the reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. Reasoning involves a multitude of aspects, among which the ability to decompose the overall problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems (i.e., subgoals) is particularly essential for effective problem-solving.\\nIn this paper, we draw inspiration from the successful application of subgoal-based methods in both RL and LLMs (Zhang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023) and introduce a novel framework called SEGO (SEquential subGoal Optimization). Intuitively, a good subgoal should serve as a bridge to solving a bigger problem, such that breaking down the problem into these subgoals makes the subproblems easier to solve, thereby increasing the likelihood of solving the entire problem. SEGO quantifes this intuition by establishing a theoretical connection between the subgoal breakdown process and the probability of solving the problem (Eq. 6). Concretely, we construct a lower bound on the probability of solving the complete problem using a proposal distribution considering a specifc subgoal. We then employ a method inspired by annealed importance sampling (Neal, 2001) to effciently navigate through vast search spaces, seeking the subgoal corresponding to the theoretically optimal proposal distribution, while ensuring the process doesn\\u2019t get trapped in suboptimal subgoals (\\u00a73.2). By incorporating these sequentially optimized subgoals into the training of the policy model, we achieve signifcant improvements in solving mathematical problems.\\nTo empirically validate the effcacy of SEGO, we conducted experiments on two primary benchmarks: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Our approach demonstrated marked superiority against existing methods with comparable model sizes, highlighting the potential of SEGO in advancing the feld of AI-driven mathematical problem-solving. We hope that our fndings can open up new avenues for future research on the applicability of LLMs to complex tasks in diverse domains (Yao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"7 Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs. Large Language Models\\u2019 (LLMs) advancement in mathematical reasoning is largely driven by datasets like GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), with additional resources like MAWPS (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016) and MWPToolkit (Lan et al., 2022) enhancing the feld. Research focuses on two main areas: prompting strategies, involving techniques like Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2023), ProgressiveHint Prompting (Zheng et al., 2023), bi-modal behavioral alignment (Zhao et al., 2024) and learning with verifcations, using methods like outcomebased verifers (Cobbe et al., 2021). Our approach, orthogonal to these methods, emphasizes adaptive curricula with subgoals to improve LLMs\\u2019 mathematical reasoning. Concurrently, MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2023) explores instruction fnetuning in LLMs for math problem-solving, a concept related to our strategy. This can be considered as an implementation of the instruction fnetuning stage within our framework.\\n\\nSubgoal-based RL. In reinforcement learning, Subgoal Search is crucial for navigating complex tasks, offering insights into subgoal benefts (Zhai et al., 2022), hierarchical structures (Wen et al., 2020), option selection (Jinnai et al., 2019a), and temporal abstraction (Fruit et al., 2017). Research focuses on exploring effcient strategies (Jinnai et al., 2019b; Hartikainen et al., 2019; Pitis et al., 2020; OpenAI et al., 2021) and enhancing planning through various algorithms (Eysenbach et al., 2019; Parascandolo et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; Moro et al., 2022; Chane-Sane et al., 2021). It also develops curricula for complex subgoals (Zhang et al., 2020, 2021). Our work addresses subgoal learning in mathematical problem-solving, exploring optimal subgoal identifcation within expansive state spaces. Owing to space constraints, a detailed discussion of related works is provided in Appendix F.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"F More Discussions about Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs. The exploration of mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been signifcantly infuenced by the development of datasets such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), serving as crucial benchmarks for assessing machine learning models in mathematical domains. GSM8K encompasses a variety of grade school math problems, while MATH compiles challenging competition mathematics problems. The introduction of extensive datasets (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2017; Talmor et al., 2018; Geva et al., 2021) and platforms like MWPToolkit (Lan et al., 2022) has enriched the feld. This exploration is systematically categorized into two main domains: prompting strategies and learning with verifcations. In the realm of prompting strategies, a variety of methods have been conceptualized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Wei et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022), Progressive-Hint Prompting (Zheng et al., 2023), Least-to-Most Prompting (Zhou et al., 2022), and bi-modal behavioral alignment (Zhao et al., 2024) have been instrumental in progressively guiding LLMs to accurate conclusions and facilitating the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. Moreover, methodologies like Complexity-Based Prompting (Fu et al., 2023) and Self-Consistency(Wang et al., 2022) exploit higher reasoning complexity and diverse reasoning paths, respectively, to realize signifcant advancements in multi-step reasoning tasks. Within learning with verifcations, the emphasis is on optimizing the mathematical profciencies of LLMs through the integration of verifers. Strategies like outcome-based verifers (Cobbe et al., 2021), step-aware verifers (Li et al., 2023; Lightman et al., 2023), and learning from partially-correct solutions (Ni et al., 2023) have been deployed to bolster reliability and precision in mathematical reasoning. While the aforementioned domains have signifcantly advanced mathematical reasoning within LLMs, our approach is orthogonal to these categories. We concentrate on the formulation of adaptive curricula, emphasizing the incorporation of subgoals, to facilitate nuanced learning pathways and enhance the model\\u2019s mathematical reasoning capabilities. A parallel and notably concurrent work, MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2023), investigates the impact of instruction fnetuning to empower large language models with mathematical problem-solving capabilities. This can be considered as an implementation of the instruction fnetuning stage within our framework.\\n\\nSubgoal-based RL. Subgoal Search is a central component in reinforcement learning, essential for empowering AI systems to navigate through complex, extensive tasks effectively. This concept has played a vital role in uncovering important aspects such as the benefts of recognizing and rewarding subgoals (Zhai et al., 2022), the proper structuring of Markov decision processes for hierarchical reinforcement learning (Wen et al., 2020), the diffculties in selecting the most suitable options for planning (Jinnai et al., 2019a), and the incorporation of temporal abstraction in RL (Fruit et al., 2017). The practical research in this feld mainly focuses on exploring and creating subgoals for planning and developing learning curricula for subgoals. Exploration is aimed at fnding the best or most effcient strategies, using diverse approaches like reducing cover time (Jinnai et al., 2019b), understanding dynamical distances (Hartikainen et al., 2019), increasing entropy (Pitis et al., 2020), and applying asymmetric self-play (OpenAI et al., 2021). In the area of subgoal planning, a variety of algorithms have been developed to refne decision-making processes. For example, SoRB (Eysenbach et al., 2019) utilizes RL to develop a graph for subgoal sequences, DC-MCTS (Parascandolo et al., 2020) employs learned subgoal proposals to divide tasks, PAIR (Li et al., 2022) combines online RL with offine supervised learning, and (Moro et al., 2022) improve MCTS with Hindsight Experience Replay for goal-oriented planning. Moreover, the work by (Chane-Sane et al., 2021) provides concise insights into improving goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by conceptualizing imagined subgoals, adding a fresh viewpoint to the feld. Research in curriculum learning has developed innovative methods to construct curricula that systematically escalate the complexity of subgoals, thereby improving the speed and quality of learning (Zhang et al., 2020, 2021). The exploration of subgoal learning in the realm of complex mathematical problem-solving represents a largely unexplored feld. Our work delves into the inherent challenges of applying subgoal learning in mathematical contexts, specifcally, the diffculty in identifying the optimal subgoal within expansive state spaces, and introduces a theoretical framework to navigate these challenges.\"}\n\nIn total, 3 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
