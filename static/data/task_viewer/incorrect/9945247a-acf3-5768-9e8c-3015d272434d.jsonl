{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Existing works (Zhou et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021) generally adhere to a two-stage learning paradigm: evidence retrieval to identify a set of key evidential sentences from a large corpus, and claim verifcation which determines the authenticity of a claim based on the semantic interactions between the claim and the retrieved evidence (Guo et al., 2022b). Considerable effort has been devoted to the claim verifcation stage (Zhong et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2021). However, solely advancing the claim verifcation might not be the panacea. The effcacy of verifcation is signifcantly contingent upon the quality of retrieved evidence (Hu et al., 2023). If the refereed evidence fails to provide accurate knowledge relevant to the claim, it would be intractable to achieve the correct decisions.\\n\\nDespite the signifcance of evidence retrieval, existing models (Zhou et al., 2019; Si et al., 2021) generally utilize a trivial retrieval strategy. All candidates are embedded into low-dimensional embeddings alongside the target claim. Subsequently, the $\\\\mathbf{k}$ -nearest neighbor (KNN) search is employed to identify the top-k evidence based on their cosine similarity to the claim. However, such KNN-based strategies suffer from two limitations. Firstly, evidence that is most semantically similar to the claim may not be the most desirable for claim verifcation. Figure 1 illustrates two example claims along with their top-4 evidence retrieved by existing methods. Although semantically similar, most top candidates fail to provide clues to verify the statement in the claim. For example, while the frst and second evidence of Case 1 exhibits a high degree of semantic correlation with the claim, they lack the pivotal evidence of \\u201caired\\u201d. Thus, simply selecting evidence based on heuristic semantic similarity may not be the optimal solution (Zhao et al., 2023). Secondly, evidence retrieval is independent from the claim verifcation, resulting in a separated training paradigm. The training signals from the verifcation loss cannot guide the update of text encoder used in the evidence retrieval. Thus, the embeddings utilized for evidence retrieval may be taskirrelevant, resulting in undesirable performance.\\n\\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the crucial yet often overlooked evidence retrieval stage, with the goal of introducing a novel end-to-end training paradigm. Gradients from the claim verifcation could be back-propagated to the evidence retrieval stage to enhance evidence selection. In this manner, retrieved evidence is ensured to be task-relevant rather than merely similar to the claim. A straightforward strategy involves concatenating the claim with each candidate evidence and feeding them into a scoring neural network to obtain a closeness score. However, this method suffers from low effciency due to its computational complexity of $O(m*n)$ , where $m$ and $n$ denote the number of claims and candidate evidence, respectively. Given that the number of candidate evidence $n$ is comparatively large, this complexity becomes impractical.\\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Verifcation framework, dubbed RAV. RAV consists of two major modules: the hybrid evidence retrieval and the joint fact verifcation. The hybrid evidence retrieval involves a retriever for preliminary fltering of candidate evidence, followed by a ranker for more precise sorting of the remaining evidence. The retriever is implemented as a bi-encoder (Guo et al., 2022a), wherein the claim and evidence are processed by separate encoders. With the inference time complexity of $O(m+n)$ , the retriever\\u2019s effciency can be further optimized using Approximate Nearest Neighbor techniques, making it wellsuited for large-scale retrieval tasks. The ranker is implemented as a cross-encoder (Zhang et al., 2021), which offers higher precision by considering semantics from both the claim and evidence sides. In the joint fact verifcation module, the signals derived from the fact verifcation loss can be back-propagated to guide the updates of both the retriever and ranker. RAV can be easily adapted to existing fact verifcation models with minor modifcations and boost the verifcation performance, demonstrating its generality and superiority.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"The mainstream paradigm of fact-checking is \\\"retrieve-then-verify\\\", and most of the existing methods focus on the claim verifcation phase. As for claim verifcation, current researches primarily adopt three distinct methodologies: sequence inference, graph reasoning, and knowledge-enhanced approaches. For sequence inference, early works concatenate all pieces of evidence for feature analysis (Nie et al., 2019). However, most current efforts adopt a nuanced strategy that integrates each evidence with the claim (Wu et al., 2021; Si et al., 2021; Kruengkrai et al., 2021), generating semantically enhanced claim-evidence pairs to facilitate deep interactions. For graph-based fact verifcation, the interplay among pieces of evidence is achieved via the mechanism of information dissemination across graph structures (Yang et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). Depending on the granularity of node attributes, evidence graph can be delineated into sentence-level, tokenlevel, and multi-level. Furthermore, in recent years, some works achieve the augmentation of evidence information through the integration of text description (Yan et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2022) or external knowledge (Zou et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023), thereby effectively improving the precision of fact verifcation.\\n\\nDespite the substantial advancements achieved in the phase of claim verifcation, the majority of existing studies fail to optimize the evidence retrieval module during the training process A pre-trained classifer is utilized to reassess evidence from optimized retriever in ReRead (Hu et al., 2023), undergoing fne-tuning through joint training (Li et al., 2017). However, this approach needs manually annotated gold evidence for supervisory information and fails to address the effciency optimization in large-scale retrieval (Yin and Roth, 2018; Zhang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2019).\\nEvidence Retrieval provides a data foundation for claim verifcation to ensure the accuracy of verifcation results. Existing methods are mostly KNNbased, which can be subdivided into evidence retrieval based on feature engineering (Chakrabarty et al., 2018), neural ranking (Subramanian and Lee, 2020; Aly and Vlachos, 2022), and pre-trained models (Liu et al., 2020). These strategies depend on specifc heuristic techniques, yet the evidence thus gathered may not beneft the process of claim verifcation well. GERE (Chen et al., 2022b) introduces a generative evidence retrieval mechanism to reduce computational resource consumption, but it remains an independent retrieval process. Hence, it can be concluded that there remains an absence of a genuinely universal, end-to-end framework.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Methodology\",\"section_content\":\"As depicted in Figure 2, the proposed RAV comprises two phases: hybrid evidence retrieval and joint fact verifcation. Given a claim $c$ and $n$ pieces of candidate evidence $E=\\\\{e_{1},e_{2},\\\\ldots,e_{n}\\\\}$ , the hybrid evidence retrieval selects the top $q$ pieces of evidence $(q\\\\ll n)$ , while the fact verifcation stage endeavors to categorize the claim.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Hybrid Evidence Retrieval\",\"section_content\":\"Retriever. Due to the considerable quantity of candidate evidence, retriever is designed to effciently flter out irrelevant candidates and recall valuable evidence. As illustrated in the left segment of Figure 2, retriever is implemented as a bi-encoder model (Zhang et al., 2021). Retriever comprises two distinct encoders: one dedicated to encoding the input claim and the other tasked with encoding the candidate evidence. The deliberate separation of encoding processes for claim and evidence yields a notable reduction in inference times, rendering it well-suited for real-time applications and large-scale endeavors.\\nGiven the input claim $c$ and the candidate evidence set $E=\\\\{e_{i}\\\\}$ , the feed-forward process of retriever is formally defned as:\\nin which Encoder $\\\\ddots$ and Encodere denote the encoder for claim and evidence, respectively. The pairwise cosine similarity is further calculated as:\\nwhere $\\\\hat{s}_{i}$ denotes the cosine similarity between the claim $c$ and the evidence $e_{i}$ . Then, $p$ evidence with the highest similarity $\\\\hat{s}_{i}$ is selected as the output of retriever $\\\\hat{E}=\\\\{\\\\hat{e_{1}},\\\\hat{e}_{2},\\\\dots,\\\\hat{e}_{p}\\\\}$ . The relevance distribution of evidence in $\\\\hat{E}$ is defned as: $\\\\hat{S}_{p}=$ $\\\\left\\\\{\\\\hat{s}_{1},\\\\hat{s}_{2},\\\\ldots,\\\\hat{s}_{p}\\\\right\\\\}$ .\\n\\nRanker. Following the effcient reduction of candidate evidence number from $n$ to $p$ by the retriever, the ranker aims to meticulously select $q$ evidence pieces from the remaining pool with $q<p\\\\ll n$ . Ranker aims to identify and prioritize the most pertinent evidence from the subset generated by the retriever. To capture the semantic correlations between claims and evidence effectively, the ranker is implemented as a cross-encoder (Zhang et al., 2021). As illustrated in Figure 2, the ranker takes both the claim and the evidence as input, generating a joint representation. Although more computationally intensive, the cross-encoder framework enables the ranker to make informed decisions by considering the holistic context from both sides.\\nBased on the claim $c$ and remained evidence $\\\\hat{E}$ , the forward process of ranker is as follows:\\nin which \\\":\\\" denotes the concatenation, and $\\\\tilde{s}_{j}$ serves as the criteria for selecting the top $q$ evidence. For evidence in $\\\\hat{E}$ , the ranker calculates its selection probability as $\\\\tilde{S}=\\\\{\\\\tilde{s}_{1},\\\\tilde{s}_{2},\\\\ldots,\\\\tilde{s}_{p}\\\\}$ .\\nJoint Optimization. The separation of the retriever and ranker renders the gradient intractable for backpropagation to the retriever. Here we utilize the KL-divergence between the relevance distribution $\\\\hat{S}$ and the selection probability distribution $\\\\tilde{S}$ as a supervisory signal to optimize the retriever:\\nBy leveraging KL-divergence, the discrepancy between the output distributions of the retriever and the ranker is minimized, facilitating the integration of knowledge from ranker to update retriever.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Joint Fact Verifcation\",\"section_content\":\"RAV is a universal framework capable of integrating various claim verifcation models.

The claim is concatenated with each retrieved evidence, forming the evidence representation. Following the graph-based message-passing and pooling operations, the combined representation of the claim and evidence is obtained, which is then fed into a classifer to derive the fnal decision. To utilize the verifcation module to provide supervisory signals for original unlabeled evidence retrieval, the ranker and classifer are jointly optimized as:\\nwhere $y\\\\in\\\\{0,1,2\\\\}$ denotes the truth label of each claim, and $y^{\\\\ast}$ is the predicted label.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.3 Model Training Paradigm\",\"section_content\":\"To improve overall effciency, we introduce asynchronous parameter updates within the hybrid evidence retrieval framework.
