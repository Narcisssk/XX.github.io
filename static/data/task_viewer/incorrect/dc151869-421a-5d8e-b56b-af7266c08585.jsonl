{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Despite variations in architectural designs, a universal challenge confronting all LLMs is the escalating cost associated with their training. Recent trends indicate a shift towards utilizing larger amounts of data (e.g., 1.4T tokens for Llama-1 (Touvron et al. 2023a), 2T tokens for Llama-2 (Touvron et al. 2023b), and 15T tokens for Llama-3 (Meta 2024)). Meanwhile, the sizes of open-sourced models continue to increase (Penedo et al. 2023; Bi et al. 2024; Mistral 2024). Consequently, a major focus within LLM research is the development of innovative methodologies that effectively mitigate training expenses, aligning with the broader objectives of Green AI (Schwartz et al. 2020).\\nIn this paper, we present our exploration to train an LLM at the 100B-parameter scale using a growth strategy inspired by previous research on progressive learning (Gong et al. 2019; Gu et al. 2021; Yao et al. 2024) and neurogenesis (Eriksson et al. 1998). \\u201cGrowth\\u201d means dynamic expansion of the parameter number count, from small to large, through the training progresses. Figure 1 illustrates three typical growth strategies: linear, sublinear, and superlinear. As the FLOPs of LLMs are approximately proportional to their number of parameters (Hoffmann et al. 2022), the area under the parameter curve represents the computational cost of training.\\n\\nWhile existing studies on scaling laws (Hoffmann et al. 2022) suggest that training a smaller model with more data may potentially result in higher scores on some tasks under a fixed FLOPs budget, they mainly consider the scenarios where model sizes are fixed through training. We believe that verifying the feasibility of a growth strategy (Gu et al. 2021; Shen et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2022; Yao et al. 2024) for extremely large models would be an important completion to scaling laws. To maximize computational efficiency, we strategically focus on implementing an aggressive growth strategy (Figure 1 (c)) for sanity check. We adapt the MSG (Yao et al. 2024) growth operators to train a model at $100\\\\mathrm{B}+$ scale. We fix our budget to be $\\\\$100K$ with 192 A800 GPUs.\\nAt the 100B scale, it is impractical to conduct strict headto-head comparison with the same model trained with fixed size from scratch. Instead, we compare our grown model, namely FLM-101B, with the existing first-generation $100\\\\mathrm{B}+$ language models (Brown et al. 2020; Zeng et al. 2023). Our model is trained with around 300 billion English and Chinese tokens, aligning it with these predecessors in terms of data scale. We first evaluate on the knowledge-oriented benchmarks (i.e., MMLU (Hendrycks et al. 2021) and CEval (Huang et al. 2023)). Nevertheless, such evaluation may not comprehensively reflect the models\\u2019 capability: it is difficult to distinguish whether the models recall a piece of knowledge or possess the capacity for reasoning and\\/or inference. Borrowing some ideas from Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests (i.e., Perceptual Reasoning and Working Memory (Watkins et al. 1995)), we consolidate another range of evaluation, including symbolic mapping (Wei et al. 2023), rule understanding, pattern mining, and anti-interference evaluations.\\n\\nWe believe these tasks are less likely to be affected by data leakage or memorization, offering a more nuanced insight into the model\\u2019s cognitive abilities beyond mere knowledge retrieval.\\nTo summarize, the paper has made the following contributions. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use a growth strategy to train an LLM with $100\\\\mathrm{B}+$ parameters from scratch. The training costs only 100,000 US dollars. Second, we demonstrate details for addressing the instability issues via improving training objectives, hyperparameter search, and function-preserving growth. Third, we conduct extensive evaluations, including both the commonly used knowledge-oriented benchmarks and the new range of evaluations inspired by IQ tests. Experimental results show that, despite its low training cost, FLM-101B is competitive and robust. Lastly, we will release the model checkpoints, as well as some related code and tools, to promote related research. Related literature is reviewed in Appendix B.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Design Overview of FLM-101B\",\"section_content\":\"In this section, we provide an outline of FLM-101B, detailing its architecture, pre-training methods, and configuration specifics.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.1 Architecture\",\"section_content\":\"Backbone. Among the many existing model architectures, we adopt FreeLM (Li et al. 2023) as the backbone for our models, with modifications. FreeLM is based on GPT (Radford et al. 2019), a transformer-like architecture with a decoder-only configuration. Different from GPT, FreeLM features two pre-training objectives: the language objective and the teacher objective (Section 2.2). We preserve the GPT3-style transformer block designs without incorporating the later modifications from Llama series. We employ the tokenizer derived from GPT-4, characterized by a vocabulary size of 100, 256.\\nxPos Integration. To enhance long sequence modeling, we integrate the Extrapolatable Position Embedding (xPos) (Sun et al. 2023). This innovation draws inspiration from RoPE (Su et al. 2021), which aims to improve the length extrapolation ability by introducing an exponential decay into the rotation matrix.\\n\\nModel Sizes. Benefiting from our growth strategy, the we produce three models with 16B, 51B, and 101B (i.e., FLM101B) parameters in a single training. The training process is carried out in a progressive manner by growing a 16B model to 51B, and then 101B.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 Pre-Training Setup\",\"section_content\":\"FLM-101B. By design, FLM-101B is an English-Chinese bilingual model. It mixes English and Chinese corpora at a ratio of approximately $53.5\\\\%:46.5\\\\%$ . Inspired by the finding that instruction data can augment LLMs\\u2019 comprehension capabilities (Ouyang et al. 2022), we integrate multi-task instructionally prompted data: OIG (Open Instruction Generalist) 1 and COIG (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist) 2, in the pre-training stage.\\neFLM-16B. To analyse the effect of domain-specific knowledge data (Section 4.2), we apply the FreeLM teacher signals (Li et al. 2023) to enhance factual capability. Due to computational cost, we incorporate these signals only in the smallest 16B model. This enhanced model is named eFLM-16B.\\nSpecifically, we employ two emojis: $\\\\overrightarrow{\\\\cdot\\\\cdot}$ $_{\\\\mathrm{U}+1\\\\mathrm{F}621}$ ) and $\\\\circledast$ $(\\\\mathrm{U}{+}1\\\\mathrm{F}608)$ 3, from the vocabulary to replace the original binary classification labels (Li et al. 2023). For the teacher signal, we supervise only on the emoji tokens, unifying the objective with language modeling. Moreover, we discard the original multi-task alternating approach and completely mix the samples from both sides in every batch. This strategy can enhance the consistency of data sampling distribution as well as improve training stability.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.3 Growth Strategy\",\"section_content\":\"The essence of the low cost in scaling up FLM-101B is the growth strategy. Specifically, we train three models, with 16B, 51B, and 101B parameters, respectively, in a sequential manner. Each model inherits knowledge from its predecessor. This is contrary to the common practice that the models of different sizes are trained independently (Touvron et al. 2023a,b).\\nFunction-preserving Growth. Function preservation means that before and after growth, the models yield consistent outputs given the same arbitrary inputs. This property has proven beneficial for both knowledge inheritance (Chen, Goodfellow, and Shlens 2016; Chen et al. 2022; Shen et al. 2022) and training stability (Yao et al. 2024). The growth operators used in FLM-101B training originate from Masked Structural Growth (MSG) (Yao et al. 2024), with adaptation. Specifically, to adapt these operators to the multi-node 3D parallel framework, we implement them by extending the model structures offline and reloading the checkpoint when the next stage starts.\\n\\nSchedules and Cost-Effectiveness. Model growth scheduling is a trade-off between the pros and cons inherent to models of different sizes (Yao et al. 2024): a smaller model is faster in computation, enabling more rapid consumption of training data for broader commonsense knowledge; conversely, a larger model is better in the reduction of loss per step, indicating a deeper understanding of the nuanced linguistic patterns. Based on the speed test results and total budget, we train the 16B model with 245.37B tokens, the 51B model with 39.64B tokens, and the 101B model with 26.54B tokens. The billion tokens per day of different sizes are listed in Table 1. Under this growth schedule, the total time cost for training FLM-101B is 21.54 days, which is $72\\\\%$ time-saving (or a 3.56x speedup) compared to training a 101B model from scratch (76.74 days estimated). This is consistent with our motivations depicted in Figure 1.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.4 The Parallelism Setup and Model Configurations\",\"section_content\":\"The Parallel Strategies. FLM-101B is trained on a cluster of 24 DGX-A800 GPU $(8\\\\times80\\\\mathrm{G})$ servers. We employ a 3D parallel strategy for optimal throughput, including the standard data parallelism (Valiant 1990), tensor model parallelism (Shoeybi et al. 2019), and pipeline model parallelism (Narayanan et al. 2021). Moreover, by employing sequence parallelism (Korthikanti et al. 2022), we slice the inputs to the Transformer core\\u2019s LayerNorm and Dropout layers along the sequence length dimension, leading to additional savings in GPU computational resources and memory utilization. We also utilize the Megetron-LM 4 implementation of the distributed optimizer (Rajbhandari et al. 2019) to further reduce GPU memory consumption, which evenly distributes the optimizer states across data parallel ranks.\\nTable 2 shows the parallelism configurations and training throughput in each stage of FLM-101B training. In different stages, we configure different Tensor Parallel $\\\\times$\\nPipeline Parallel sizes to achieve higher efficiency. The singleGPU throughput for all three training stages consistently exceeds 160 teraFLOPs\\/sec with a utilization rate of at least $51.3\\\\%$ . For comparison, GLM-130B achieves 135 teraFLOPs\\/sec (Zeng et al. 2023) with a $42.27\\\\%$ utilization rate. We can also find that FLM-101B has a higher FLOP utilization rate than Megatron-LM (Korthikanti et al. 2022) under a similar model size.\\nFLM-101B Configurations. The FLM-101B model is structured with a hidden state dimension of 10, 240, a layer number of 80, a context window of 2,048 tokens, 80 attention heads, and a vocabulary size of 100, 256. FLM-101B uses the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter 2017) with $\\\\beta_{1}=0.9$ and $\\\\beta_{2}=0.95$ . A cosine learning rate schedule is employed, leading to a final learning rate of $6e-6$ . We use a weight decay of 0.1 and gradient clipping of 1.0.\\nTable 1 presents part of the hyperparameters used in different growth stages. In each growth stage, we approximately inherit the previous learning rate and adhere to the same schedule. The learning rate at the beginning of each stage is reported in the table. In the 16B stage, 4,608k samples are used for learning rate warmup, while in later growth stages, we use fewer samples of 230.4k. Note that we do not apply batch size warmup because we address the stability issue in a different manner, detailed in Section 3.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 Training Stability of FLM-101B\",\"section_content\":\"Models beyond 100B parameters (Scao et al. 2022; Zeng et al. 2023) usually suffer from a bunch of notorious stability issues including loss divergence, gradient explosion, and numerical overflow\\/underflow. This not only inflates the cost of searching for feasible hyperparameters like optimal learning rates, but also intensifies ongoing maintenance during training, such as babysitting, issue resolution, data adjustment, and rebooting. Moreover, this makes the budget of the whole project unpredictable. In this section, we introduce details for mitigating these issues.\\n\\nPredictable Scaling. The Tensor Programs theories (Yang and Hu 2021; Littwin and Yang 2023) unveil the universal relations of the training dynamics with the model width tending to infinite. This results in a parameterized mapping for certain classes of hyperparameters between a small model and its larger counterparts, which is termed $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{P}$ (Yang et al. 2021). Two important insights are: (i) The wider, the better: theoretically, under $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{P}$ transfer, a wider model will always yield lower loss than its narrower counterparts when exposed to identical data (Yang et al. 2021). As a direct corollary, if a narrow model converges, its wider counterparts will always converge. (ii) Loss prediction: the loss value of a large model is predictable using the loss of its smaller counterparts (OpenAI 2023). $\\\\mu$ Scaling (Yao and Wang 2023) open-sources a methodology through which loss prediction can be achieved by combining $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{P}$ (Yang et al. 2021) and (a modified) scaling law (Kaplan et al. 2020; Henighan et al. 2020; Hoffmann et al. 2022).\\nBased on these findings, our method to solve training stability is as follows: we first determine the data distribution before the FLM-16B training starts. Next, we perform a grid search on three hyperparameters including the learning rate, initialization standard deviation, and the softmax temperature in the output layer. This grid search is performed with a small proxy model (less than $100M$ ) with a hidden state dimension (\\u201cmodel width\\u201d) of 256 and a head number of 2. All the other structural configurations and training data are identical to those of FLM-16B. A single run of grid search takes 24.6 hours with data parallelism on 6 nodes, which is equivalent to 6 hours per run given our 24-node infrastructure. Finally, we find a group of well-performing hyperparameters: learning rate $=4e\\\\mathrm{~-~}4$ , standard deviation $=1.6e\\\\mathrm{~-~}2$ , and softmax temperature $=2.0$ . Transferring these hyperparameters to the 16B model via $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{P}$ (Yang et al. 2021) led to a seamless training experience devoid of instabilities. Combined with MSG (Yao et al. 2024), we also witness no post-growth divergence in FLM-51B and FLM-101B.\\nOur implementations of $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{P}$ are largely consistent with those in $\\\\mu$ Scaling (Yao and Wang 2023), with modifications to handle the rotary embedding. Thus, the value range of FLM-16B loss is also predictable with the results from multiple proxy widths at the same steps. Mixed-precision training is applied to save run-time memory and reduce time costs. Specifically, we choose Bfloat16 instead of FP16 due to its superior precision for values approaching zero, making it more suitable for $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{P}.$ As a result, we do not encounter the FP16 underflow issue reported by (Yang et al. 2021). Moreover, Bfloat16 negates the need for loss scale adjustments, making our training procedure more promising and reproducible.\\n\\nThe full training loss curve is presented in Figure 2. We observe that the loss curve becomes steeper after each growth. It matches the intuition that a larger model is better in loss reduction per step. The whole training procedure is robust and predictable: even though the 51B stage is short with only 40B tokens, the 101B training remains stable. This supports the effectiveness of the growth strategy.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
