{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

This is a long-standing fascinating question, which poses challenges to research areas like software engineering, programming language, and artifcial intelligence. Realizing this scenario would have an unprecedented impact on our lives, education, economy, and labour market, as it would change the centralized software development and operation paradigm. Due to its promising and intriguing future, natural-languageto-code (NL2Code) has been proposed as a research task that has attracted widespread interest in both academia and industry, with the goal of generating code from natural language descriptions.\\n\\nEarly studies on NL2Code were mainly based on heuristic rules or expert systems, such as probabilistic grammar-based methods (Joshi and Rambow, 2003; Cohn et al., 2010; Allamanis and Sutton, 2014) and those focusing on domain-specifc languages (de Moura and Bj\\u00f8rner, 2008; Gulwani, 2010; Jha et al., 2010), which are infexible and not scalable. Other studies utilized static language models, like n-gram (Nguyen et al., 2013; Raychev et al., 2014; Devanbu, 2012) and Hidden Markov (Sutskever et al., 2008), which have sparse vector representations and cannot model long-term dependencies. Subsequently, neural networks, including CNN (Liu et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018), RNN (Iyer et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2018), and LSTM (Eriguchi et al., 2016; Yin and Neubig, 2017), were employed to model the relationship between NL and code. In 2017, the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) model was introduced for machine translation and later applied to the NL2Code task (Mastropaolo et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021). However, these deep learning models require a signifcant amount of labelled pairs of NL and code for training, and have limited capabilities for the NL2Code task.\\nRecently, a growing number of large language models (LLMs) with Transformer architecture have been trained on large-scale unlabelled code corpus. These models have the ability to generate code in a zero-shot manner and have achieved impressive results in the NL2Code task. As a milestone, Codex (Chen et al., 2021) has shown that an LLM with 12 billion parameters is able to solve $72.31\\\\%$ of challenging Python programming problems created by humans. More encouragingly, Codex has been used to power a commercial\\nFigure 1: A simple example of the NL2Code task. The code blocks marked in grey, green, and yellow represent the natural language problem description, the predicted code solution, and the test cases, respectively.\\nproduct1 and improve coding effciency in practice (Sobania et al., 2022a; Barke et al., 2023). Following Codex\\u2019s success, various LLMs for the NL2Code task have emerged, with model sizes ranging from millions to billions of parameters. Examples include AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), which aims to solve competitive-level programming problems, and InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), which supports flling code in arbitrary positions using bidirectional contexts. Other models such as CodeGen (Nijkamp et al., 2023), PaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022), PanGu-Coder (Christopoulou et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023) have also gained great attention. As the model size increases, LLMs have been shown to exhibit some emergent capabilities such as human-like programming and debugging (Zhang et al., 2022; Saunders et al., 2022; Kang et al., 2023).\\nLarge language models have kindled hope for the NL2Code task due to their impressive power and potential value. Despite the signifcant progress, there are still numerous challenges and opportunities, calling for more advanced and innovative future work. Currently, considering the variety of techniques and applications, there is a growing need for a comprehensive survey to provide a systematic overview of this feld and identify critical challenges. To this end, in this paper, we carefully investigate 27 advanced LLMs for NL2Code (\\u00a72), and also review benchmarks and metrics (\\u00a74). We conduct an intuitive comparison of all the existing LLMs on the HumanEval benchmark, perform a thorough analysis, and eventually attribute the success of these LLMs to \\\"Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning\\\" (\\u00a73).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the frst survey of LLMs for NL2Code2, and we hope it will contribute to the ongoing development of this exciting feld.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Large Language Models for NL2Code\",\"section_content\":\"Given a natural language problem description, the NL2Code task aims to automatically generate the demanded code. To illustrate this task visually, we provide a Python programming problem as an example in Figure 1, while different NL2Code benchmarks may vary in terms of language or problem domain. Existing large language models for the NL2Code task are usually based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and are trained on a large-scale code related unlabelled corpus. For better code generation performance, most LLMs, no matter encoder-decoder or decoder-only models, employ the causal language modeling objective for training, which is to predict the token following a sequence of tokens. During inference, an LLM can tackle NL2Code problems in a zero-shot manner without fne-tuning its parameters. There are also studies employing few-shot (Austin et al., 2021) or in-context learning (Nijkamp et al., 2023) to further boost the performance.\\n\\nWe conduct a comprehensive investigation of 27 representative LLMs for the NL2Code task. Details of each model are summarized in Table 1, where models vary in architecture, size, and accessibility. For better visualization, we present these models in chronological order in Figure 2, plotting the largest model sizes. One trend observed is that these large language models are consistently growing in size as the research feld advances. Additionally, the decoder-only architecture is favoured for pre-trained models with larger sizes.\\nEarly works, such as GPT-C (Svyatkovskiy et al., 2020), PyMT5 (Clement et al., 2020), and PLBART (Ahmad et al., 2021), have relatively small numbers of parameters and do not demonstrate strong capabilities in zero-shot code generation. Conversely, large-scale models such as GPT\\nNeo (Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), despite their billion-level parameter scale, have been found to have limited power in the NL2Code task due to the small amount of code in their training corpus. Recently, a number of powerful LLMs have been proposed for NL2Code, such as Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), and PaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022), which possess massive parameter scales and high-quality training corpus with code. While they show surprisingly good performance on NL2Code, most of them are not readily accessible. At present, a number of excellent open-source models have also been proposed, including CodeParrot (Huggingface, 2021), PolyCoder (Xu et al., 2022), GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which contribute to the thriving of LLMs for NL2Code. Besides, recent studies have proposed various approaches to address specifc NL2Code scenarios. For example, JuPyT5 (Chandel et al., 2022a) is designed to work within Jupyter Notebooks, while ERNIECode (Chai et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) are trained to support multiple natural or programming languages. Additionally, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), FIM (Bavarian et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023) not only support left-to-right code prediction, but also allow for inflling arbitrary regions of code. As LLMs for NL2Code are evolving rapidly, we created a website to keep up-to-date with the latest advances by crowd-sourcing. Details of the website can be found in Appendix B.\\n\\nThese models are not only attractive in academia (Chen et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022b), but also applied in real-world products to improve programming effciency (Sobania et al., $2022\\\\mathrm{a}$ ; Barke et al., 2023). One example is GitHub and OpenAI\\u2019s Copilot, a programming assistance tool that utilizes Codex to provide realtime code suggestions. Other notable products include CodeGeeX3 and CodeWhisperer4. A summary of 10 products can be found in Appendix Table 5. Recent studies (Sobania et al., 2022b; Pearce et al., 2022; Nguyen and Nadi, 2022) have shown that these products can provide helpful recommendations, while they also introduce minor bugs that can cause issues for users. There is still room for improvement before LLMs can be fully practical and capable of coding like humans.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 What makes LLMs successful?\",\"section_content\":\"We have summarized the existing large language models for NL2Code. These LLMs vary in terms of architecture, size, and other characteristics, making it diffcult to establish a completely fair comparison. We evaluate these LLMs on the HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) in a zero-shot manner to provide an intuitive comparison. HumanEval, proposed along with Codex, is one of the most popular benchmarks for the NL2Code task and consists of 164 hand-written Python programming problems. Test cases are provided for each programming problem to evaluate the correctness of generated code. pass $@k$ is used as the evaluation metric , which calculates the proportion of problems that can be correctly answered with $k$ tries. Table 2 shows the results of different LLMs organized by the model size. Implementation details and the evaluation on the MBPP benchmark (Austin et al., 2021) can be found in Appendix C.2.\\nIt can be observed from Table 2 that the performance of existing LLMs varies widely on HumanEval, even for those with similar model sizes. Specifcally, Codex (Chen et al., 2021) holds the leading position in various model sizes, while a relatively small model, PyCodeGPT 110M (Zan et al., 2022b), achieves comparable results to Codex 85M. Other larger models such as Alpha\\nTable 2: Performance on the HumanEval benchmark. \\u2020 denotes our reproduced results, while others are cited from the original papers. AlphaCode(dec) means the decoder-only version. We also compare the Codex models (code-cushman and code-davinci) provided by OpenAI API. We exclude the models that cannot pass any problem in the benchmark.\\nCode (Li et al., 2022b), CodeGen-Mono (Nijkamp et al., 2023), and PanGu-Coder (Christopoulou et al., 2022) also exhibit impressive performance. Notably, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023) and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which use the FIM training method (Bavarian et al., 2022), also obtain remarkably decent results in the left-to-right generation setting. The signifcant variation in performance leads us to the question: What makes LLMs successful in NL2Code? Given the diversity of these models in terms of design choices, we perform a thorough analysis and conclude the answer: Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning. That is, large model and data size, high-quality data and expert hyper-parameter tuning are the key factors for the success of LLMs in the NL2Code task. In this section, we detail our observations and insights from the perspectives of model, data and tuning.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Large Model Size\",\"section_content\":\"As shown in Figure 2 and Table 2, recent LLMs for NL2Code exhibit larger sizes and superior performance. This is consistent with prior fndings that an increased number of model parameters can enhance model capabilities (Radford et al., 2019; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). We further demonstrate the correlation between model size and performance in Figure 3a, which compares the pass $@1$ results of 10 representative models on the HumanEval benchmark. It is clear that larger models generally result in better performance. Furthermore, we also fnd that current models, regardless of size, still have the potential for improvement through further increases in size. Additional results on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks can be found in Appendix Figure 7, which also support this conclusion.\\n\\nAdditionally, we conduct an experiment on the HumanEval benchmark to examine the syntax error rates of the code generated by different models of varying sizes. Specifcally, we make the models predict 10 code samples for each programming problem, and then calculate the percentage of code samples that have syntax errors. As shown in Figure 3b, results indicate that larger models tend to have lower syntax error rates. It is noteworthy that the largest version of the CodeGen-Mono model exhibits a remarkably low rate of syntax errors, i.e., $6\\\\%$ . However, as evidenced by Figure 3a and Table 2, the CodeGen-Mono model with 16 billion parameters still has unsatisfactory performance in terms of pass $@k$ , e.g., pass $@1$ to be $29\\\\%$ . This highlights the fact that the current limitation for large pre-trained models is the generation of semantically correct code.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Large and Premium Data\",\"section_content\":\"As the sizes of LLMs increase in the feld of NL2Code, the scale of the corpus used for training also increases. This highlights the importance of selecting and pre-processing high-quality data. In this section, we will discuss various commonly used data sources and pre-processing strategies that are essential for training LLMs.\\nEarly models were trained using manually annotated data pairs of NL and code, and the data sources include CodeSearchNet (Husain et al., 2019), CoST (Zhu et al., 2022b), and XLCoST (Zhu et al., 2022a). However, manual annotation is labour-intensive and time-consuming. There are also models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021), and GPT\\nJ (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021) that are trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020), a large-scale unsupervised dataset. However, these models have not yet demonstrated exceptional code generation capabilities due to the limited number of code fles in the training corpus. More recently, with the emergence of more powerful LLMs for NL2Code, larger-scale unlabelled code datasets have been proposed, including BigQuery (Google, 2016), CodeParrot\\u2019s corpus (HuggingFace, 2021a), GitHub-Code (HuggingFace, 2021b), and the Stack (HuggingFace, 2022), which are collected from general domain open-source websites like GitHub6 and Stack Overfow7. Furthermore, there are also specialized datasets proposed for different scenarios, for example, using Jupyter Notebooks or competition programming problems as a training corpus. Released datasets include Jupyter (HuggingFace, 2021c), JuICe (Agashe et al., 2019), APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and CodeNet (IBM, 2021).\\nIn order to ensure the quality of the training corpus, it is common for LLMs to perform data preprocessing on the signifcant amount of code in the collected data. We carefully review the data pre-processing methods of fve powerful LLMs, including Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), CodeGen (Nijkamp et al., 2023), InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), and PyCodeGPT (Zan et al., 2022b), and identify several commonalities. One is the removal of likely auto-generated or unfnished code fles, as they are deemed to be meaningless. Additionally, specifc rules are employed to flter out uncommon code fles. These rules include factors such as the repository star rating, the fle size, the line length, and the alphanumeric rate. In summary, the goal of these pre-processing strategies is to achieve a code corpus that is unduplicated, complete, correct, clean, and general in nature.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.3 Expert Tuning\",\"section_content\":\"Training an excellent model requires careful consideration of various design choices and hyperparameters. After reviewing the existing 27 LLMs (summary in Appendix Table 6), we have the following fndings. Firstly, these LLMs share some common settings. For example, we observe that the optimizer of the current models is almost all Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) or its variants (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017). We also fnd that initializing with other natural language models yields no noticeable gain compared to training from scratch, except for accelerating convergence (Chen et al., 2021). Furthermore, there are several hyper-parameters that require expert tuning, such as learning rate, batch size, window size, warmup steps, gradient accumulation steps, and sampling temperature. For the learning rate, we analyze its correlation with model size using six powerful LLMs, as shown in Figure 4. We observe that the learning rate becomes smaller as the model gets larger. To explore the effects of temperature, in Figure 5, we report the performance of two models using multiple temperatures on HumanEval. One observation is that higher temperature leads to lower pass $@1$ and higher pass $@100$ , which suggests that a higher temperature makes LLMs generate more diverse predictions and vice versa. Besides, some studies (erman Arsenovich Arutyunov and Avdoshin, 2022) have shown that window size is a key factor. An interesting fnding is that the small model with a large window size sometimes outperforms the large model with a small window size (details in Appendix D). In addition, powerful LLMs usually train a new tokenizer on code corpus primarily using two techniques: Byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding (Radford et al., 2019) and SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). A new tokenizer can be more effective and accurate in splitting code content into tokens. These proven tuning techniques will serve as valuable references for training more powerful LLMs.\"}\n\n... # only display 8 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Existing large language models for the NL2Code task are usually based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and are trained on a large-scale code related unlabelled corpus. For better code generation performance, most LLMs, no matter encoder-decoder or decoder-only models, employ the causal language modeling objective for training, which is to predict the token following a sequence of tokens. During inference, an LLM can tackle NL2Code problems in a zero-shot manner without fne-tuning its parameters. There are also studies employing few-shot (Austin et al., 2021) or in-context learning (Nijkamp et al., 2023) to further boost the performance.\\n\\nWe conduct a comprehensive investigation of 27 representative LLMs for the NL2Code task. Details of each model are summarized in Table 1, where models vary in architecture, size, and accessibility. For better visualization, we present these models in chronological order in Figure 2, plotting the largest model sizes. One trend observed is that these large language models are consistently growing in size as the research feld advances. Additionally, the decoder-only architecture is favoured for pre-trained models with larger sizes.\\nEarly works, such as GPT-C (Svyatkovskiy et al., 2020), PyMT5 (Clement et al., 2020), and PLBART (Ahmad et al., 2021), have relatively small numbers of parameters and do not demonstrate strong capabilities in zero-shot code generation. Conversely, large-scale models such as GPT\\nNeo (Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), despite their billion-level parameter scale, have been found to have limited power in the NL2Code task due to the small amount of code in their training corpus. Recently, a number of powerful LLMs have been proposed for NL2Code, such as Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), and PaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022), which possess massive parameter scales and high-quality training corpus with code. While they show surprisingly good performance on NL2Code, most of them are not readily accessible. At present, a number of excellent open-source models have also been proposed, including CodeParrot (Huggingface, 2021), PolyCoder (Xu et al., 2022), GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which contribute to the thriving of LLMs for NL2Code. Besides, recent studies have proposed various approaches to address specifc NL2Code scenarios. For example, JuPyT5 (Chandel et al., 2022a) is designed to work within Jupyter Notebooks, while ERNIECode (Chai et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) are trained to support multiple natural or programming languages. Additionally, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), FIM (Bavarian et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023) not only support left-to-right code prediction, but also allow for inflling arbitrary regions of code. As LLMs for NL2Code are evolving rapidly, we created a website to keep up-to-date with the latest advances by crowd-sourcing. Details of the website can be found in Appendix B.\\n\\nThese models are not only attractive in academia (Chen et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022b), but also applied in real-world products to improve programming effciency (Sobania et al., $2022\\\\mathrm{a}$ ; Barke et al., 2023). One example is GitHub and OpenAI\\u2019s Copilot, a programming assistance tool that utilizes Codex to provide realtime code suggestions. Other notable products include CodeGeeX3 and CodeWhisperer4. A summary of 10 products can be found in Appendix Table 5. Recent studies (Sobania et al., 2022b; Pearce et al., 2022; Nguyen and Nadi, 2022) have shown that these products can provide helpful recommendations, while they also introduce minor bugs that can cause issues for users.

To illustrate this task visually, we provide a Python programming problem as an example in Figure 1, while different NL2Code benchmarks may vary in terms of language or problem domain. Existing large language models for the NL2Code task are usually based on Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and are trained on a large-scale code related unlabelled corpus. For better code generation performance, most LLMs, no matter encoder-decoder or decoder-only models, employ the causal language modeling objective for training, which is to predict the token following a sequence of tokens. During inference, an LLM can tackle NL2Code problems in a zero-shot manner without fne-tuning its parameters. There are also studies employing few-shot (Austin et al., 2021) or in-context learning (Nijkamp et al., 2023) to further boost the performance.\\n\\nWe conduct a comprehensive investigation of 27 representative LLMs for the NL2Code task. Details of each model are summarized in Table 1, where models vary in architecture, size, and accessibility. For better visualization, we present these models in chronological order in Figure 2, plotting the largest model sizes. One trend observed is that these large language models are consistently growing in size as the research feld advances. Additionally, the decoder-only architecture is favoured for pre-trained models with larger sizes.\\nEarly works, such as GPT-C (Svyatkovskiy et al., 2020), PyMT5 (Clement et al., 2020), and PLBART (Ahmad et al., 2021), have relatively small numbers of parameters and do not demonstrate strong capabilities in zero-shot code generation. Conversely, large-scale models such as GPT\\nNeo (Black et al., 2021) and GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), despite their billion-level parameter scale, have been found to have limited power in the NL2Code task due to the small amount of code in their training corpus. Recently, a number of powerful LLMs have been proposed for NL2Code, such as Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), and PaLM-Coder (Chowdhery et al., 2022), which possess massive parameter scales and high-quality training corpus with code. While they show surprisingly good performance on NL2Code, most of them are not readily accessible. At present, a number of excellent open-source models have also been proposed, including CodeParrot (Huggingface, 2021), PolyCoder (Xu et al., 2022), GPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which contribute to the thriving of LLMs for NL2Code. Besides, recent studies have proposed various approaches to address specifc NL2Code scenarios. For example, JuPyT5 (Chandel et al., 2022a) is designed to work within Jupyter Notebooks, while ERNIECode (Chai et al., 2022), CodeGeeX (Zheng et al., 2023), and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) are trained to support multiple natural or programming languages. Additionally, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), FIM (Bavarian et al., 2022), and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023) not only support left-to-right code prediction, but also allow for inflling arbitrary regions of code. As LLMs for NL2Code are evolving rapidly, we created a website to keep up-to-date with the latest advances by crowd-sourcing. Details of the website can be found in Appendix B.\\n\\nThese models are not only attractive in academia (Chen et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022b), but also applied in real-world products to improve programming effciency (Sobania et al., $2022\\\\mathrm{a}$ ; Barke et al., 2023). One example is GitHub and OpenAI\\u2019s Copilot, a programming assistance tool that utilizes Codex to provide realtime code suggestions. Other notable products include CodeGeeX3 and CodeWhisperer4. A summary of 10 products can be found in Appendix Table 5.

These LLMs vary in terms of architecture, size, and other characteristics, making it diffcult to establish a completely fair comparison. We evaluate these LLMs on the HumanEval benchmark (Chen et al., 2021) in a zero-shot manner to provide an intuitive comparison. HumanEval, proposed along with Codex, is one of the most popular benchmarks for the NL2Code task and consists of 164 hand-written Python programming problems. Test cases are provided for each programming problem to evaluate the correctness of generated code. pass $@k$ is used as the evaluation metric , which calculates the proportion of problems that can be correctly answered with $k$ tries. Table 2 shows the results of different LLMs organized by the model size. Implementation details and the evaluation on the MBPP benchmark (Austin et al., 2021) can be found in Appendix C.2.\\nIt can be observed from Table 2 that the performance of existing LLMs varies widely on HumanEval, even for those with similar model sizes. Specifcally, Codex (Chen et al., 2021) holds the leading position in various model sizes, while a relatively small model, PyCodeGPT 110M (Zan et al., 2022b), achieves comparable results to Codex 85M. Other larger models such as Alpha\\nTable 2: Performance on the HumanEval benchmark. \\u2020 denotes our reproduced results, while others are cited from the original papers. AlphaCode(dec) means the decoder-only version. We also compare the Codex models (code-cushman and code-davinci) provided by OpenAI API.

Notably, InCoder (Fried et al., 2023) and SantaCoder (Allal et al., 2023), which use the FIM training method (Bavarian et al., 2022), also obtain remarkably decent results in the left-to-right generation setting. The signifcant variation in performance leads us to the question: What makes LLMs successful in NL2Code? Given the diversity of these models in terms of design choices, we perform a thorough analysis and conclude the answer: Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning.

This is consistent with prior fndings that an increased number of model parameters can enhance model capabilities (Radford et al., 2019; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022). We further demonstrate the correlation between model size and performance in Figure 3a, which compares the pass $@1$ results of 10 representative models on the HumanEval benchmark. It is clear that larger models generally result in better performance. Furthermore, we also fnd that current models, regardless of size, still have the potential for improvement through further increases in size. Additional results on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks can be found in Appendix Figure 7, which also support this conclusion.\\n\\nAdditionally, we conduct an experiment on the HumanEval benchmark to examine the syntax error rates of the code generated by different models of varying sizes. Specifcally, we make the models predict 10 code samples for each programming problem, and then calculate the percentage of code samples that have syntax errors. As shown in Figure 3b, results indicate that larger models tend to have lower syntax error rates. It is noteworthy that the largest version of the CodeGen-Mono model exhibits a remarkably low rate of syntax errors, i.e., $6\\\\%$ . However, as evidenced by Figure 3a and Table 2, the CodeGen-Mono model with 16 billion parameters still has unsatisfactory performance in terms of pass $@k$ , e.g., pass $@1$ to be $29\\\\%$ . This highlights the fact that the current limitation for large pre-trained models is the generation of semantically correct code.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Large and Premium Data\",\"section_content\":\"As the sizes of LLMs increase in the feld of NL2Code, the scale of the corpus used for training also increases. This highlights the importance of selecting and pre-processing high-quality data. In this section, we will discuss various commonly used data sources and pre-processing strategies that are essential for training LLMs.\\nEarly models were trained using manually annotated data pairs of NL and code, and the data sources include CodeSearchNet (Husain et al., 2019), CoST (Zhu et al., 2022b), and XLCoST (Zhu et al., 2022a). However, manual annotation is labour-intensive and time-consuming. There are also models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021), and GPT\\nJ (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021) that are trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020), a large-scale unsupervised dataset. However, these models have not yet demonstrated exceptional code generation capabilities due to the limited number of code fles in the training corpus. More recently, with the emergence of more powerful LLMs for NL2Code, larger-scale unlabelled code datasets have been proposed, including BigQuery (Google, 2016), CodeParrot\\u2019s corpus (HuggingFace, 2021a), GitHub-Code (HuggingFace, 2021b), and the Stack (HuggingFace, 2022), which are collected from general domain open-source websites like GitHub6 and Stack Overfow7. Furthermore, there are also specialized datasets proposed for different scenarios, for example, using Jupyter Notebooks or competition programming problems as a training corpus. Released datasets include Jupyter (HuggingFace, 2021c), JuICe (Agashe et al., 2019), APPS (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and CodeNet (IBM, 2021).\\nIn order to ensure the quality of the training corpus, it is common for LLMs to perform data preprocessing on the signifcant amount of code in the collected data. We carefully review the data pre-processing methods of fve powerful LLMs, including Codex (Chen et al., 2021), AlphaCode (Li et al., 2022b), CodeGen (Nijkamp et al., 2023), InCoder (Fried et al., 2023), and PyCodeGPT (Zan et al., 2022b), and identify several commonalities. One is the removal of likely auto-generated or unfnished code fles, as they are deemed to be meaningless. Additionally, specifc rules are employed to flter out uncommon code fles. These rules include factors such as the repository star rating, the fle size, the line length, and the alphanumeric rate. In summary, the goal of these pre-processing strategies is to achieve a code corpus that is unduplicated, complete, correct, clean, and general in nature.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Challenges and Opportunities\",\"section_content\":\"Our investigations have revealed that advances in LLMs for NL2Code have a considerable impact on both academia and industry. Despite this progress, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, offering ample opportunities for further research and applications. In this section, we explore the challenges and opportunities in terms of the ability gap between LLMs and humans.\\nUnderstanding Ability The inherent fexibility of natural language allows for a variety of expressions to convey functional requirements. Humans are able to understand various descriptions at different levels of abstraction. In contrast, current LLMs tend to be sensitive to the given context, which may cause unexpected performance degradation (Wang et al., 2022a). In addition, LLMs may struggle when faced with complex problems that have numerous conditions and requirements (Barke et al., 2022; Imai, 2022). We believe exploring the understanding abilities of LLMs is a crucial research direction. One potential solution is to break down complex problems into multiple steps, as is commonly done in reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022).\\nJudgement Ability Humans have the ability to determine whether they can solve a programming problem or not. While current models will always return a solution even if there is no answer to the problem, due to the fact that they are trained by unsupervised causal language modeling objective. This can cause problems in practical applications. To improve the judgment ability of LLMs, researchers have employed reinforcement learning to leverage user feedback, as seen in models like InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and ChatGPT8. However, collecting high-quality feedback for code is costly and challenging. There are also ongoing studies (Chen et al., 2023; Key et al., 2022) exploring the possibility of self-validation for LLMs, which is also a promising research direction.\\n\\nExplanation Ability It is widely acknowledged that human developers possess the ability to interpret the meaning of the code they write, which is crucial for educational purposes and software maintenance. Recent studies showed that LLMs have the potential to automatically generate code explanations. MacNeil et al. (2022a) proposed using LLMs to generate code explanations for students during their learning process, and MacNeil et al. (2022b) proposed explaining numerous aspects of a given code snippet using Copilot. Further research and explorations are necessary to fully realize the potential of LLMs in this regard.\\nAdaptive Learning Ability A fundamental difference between current large language models and humans is their ability to adapt to new and updated knowledge. Human developers possess a unique ability to quickly search and learn new materials, such as programming documentation, and adapt to changes in APIs with relative ease. However, re-training or fne-tuning LLMs requires signifcant effort and resources. This issue has inspired a number of recent studies, such as DocCoder (Zhou et al., 2023) and APICoder (Zan et al., 2022a), which utilize retrieval-based methods to provide extra or updated knowledge during model inference. Despite these advancements, it remains an open challenge to endow LLMs with the powerful learning capabilities humans possess.\\nMulti-tasking Ability Large language models have been applied to a variety of code-related tasks, such as code repair (Joshi et al., 2022; Prenner and Robbes, 2021), code search (Neelakantan et al., 2022), and code review (Li et al., 2022c) as well as non-code tasks that can be formatted in a code-like manner, such as mathematics (Drori and Verma, 2021; Drori et al., 2021) and chemistry (Krenn et al., 2022; Hocky and White, 2022). However, there are differences between LLMs and human abilities in terms of multi-tasking. Humans can seamlessly switch between tasks, while LLMs may require sophisticated prompt engineering (Liu et al., 2023). Another evidence is that LLMs lack the ability to quickly master multiple programming languages (Zheng et al., 2023) as humans do. These limitations highlight areas for future research.\"}\n\nIn total, 4 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
