{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The\\nmain goal of current cross-prompt AES sys-\\ntems is to learn enough shared features be-\\ntween the source and target prompts to grade\\nwell on the target prompt.

To this end, we propose a prompt represen-\\ntation learning framework for cross-prompt AES\\n(PMAES) in which we design a prompt-mapping\\ncontrastive learning strategy to effectively learn\\nabout more consistent representations of source and\\ntarget prompts. To do this, we design a mapping\\noperation to project each essay from the source\\nprompt to the target prompt and get its mapping\\nrepresentation speci\\ufb01c to the target prompt. For\\neach essay on the source prompt (let\\u2019s say rs), we\\n\\ufb01rst determine how similar it is to all the essays in\\nthe target prompt by their original representations\\n(e.g., by taking the dot product with the inverse\\nmatrix of the representations of all the essays in the\\ntarget prompt) as the weights of the rs to each tar-\\nget essay. Then, we employ a learnable parameter\\nmatrix (speci\\ufb01cally, a prompt-mapping matrix) to\\nacquire the weighted representation of the source\\nprompt essay projected on the target prompt to\\nexpress the mapping representation of the source\\nessay rs (let\\u2019s say \\u02c6\\nrs). These source essay rep-\\nresentations and source mapping representations\\nare treated as the source-to-target mapping pairs\\n(rs, \\u02c6\\nrs). By decreasing the distance between the\\nessays in these mapping pairs, we may gradually\\nreduce the discrepancy between the source and tar-\\nget prompts and \\ufb01nally make the representations\\nof the two prompt essays more consistent. It is\\nworth noting that the above description is about\\nmapping from source to target. Naturally, we also\\nperform target-to-source prompt mapping opera-\\ntions to further learn a more consistent representa-\\ntions of the two prompts, which will be described\\nin Section 3.4.\\nAs demonstrated in Figure 1, given the origi-\\nnal essay representations of a source and a target\\nprompt (which we marked in green and red, respec-\\ntively), there are very few shared features between\\nthem under the original representations (which we\\nmarked in yellow). When we train the model using\\nour proposed prompt-mapping approach, the rep-\\nresentations of the two prompts may become more\\nsimilar, which enables more shared features across\\nthe two prompts. We show them in Figure 1(b)\\nand Figure 1(c). As the shared features increase,\\nwe can get more accurate representations of target\\nprompt essays and grade them more accurately. To\\nsummarize, the main contributions of our work are\\nas follows:\\n1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the \\ufb01rst\\nattempt to explore the learning of consistent rep-\\nresentations of different prompts by introducing a\\nprompt-mapping learning strategy in order to ob-\\ntain more shared features between the source and\\ntarget prompts.\\n2) We conduct comprehensive experiments on\\nthe ASAP++ dataset, and the results show that our\\napproach outperforms the state-of-the-art model\\non both single-overall and multi-attribute scoring\\ntasks. Also, the prompt consistency experiments\\nshow that our method can make source and target\\nprompts much more similar to each other.\\n3) We further design three types of source-target\\nsettings. The results show that our approach can be\\nadapted to multiple scenarios.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\n2.1\\nPrompt-speci\\ufb01c AES\\nPrompt-speci\\ufb01c AES aims to train and test essays\\non the same prompt.

Suppose each essay is\\ncomposed of n sentences, and each sentence con-\\ntains m words. We use wi to denote the POS em-\\nbedding of each word for convenience. Then, the\\nsentence-level representation is captured by CNN\\nwith attention pooling:\\nci = CNN([wi : wi+l\\u22121]), i = 1, 2, ..., m\\n(1)\\nst = attention([c1 : cm])\\n(2)\\n1We use the NLTK (http:\\/\\/www.nltk.org)\\n1491\\n\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\\u25a1 D1.
