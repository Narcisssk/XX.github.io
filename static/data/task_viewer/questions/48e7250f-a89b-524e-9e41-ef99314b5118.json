    "question": "According to the paper that proposes the Subspace Identification Guarantee model, which method is used to estimate the label distribution from the target domain $p_{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}$? What's the formula of the loss they reweight using the distribution? In the paper that proposes the aforementioned method, as the dataset size increases, when the proposed method first surpasses the baseline method on MNIST with $\\alpha=1.0$?",
    "answer_format": "Your answer should be a Python list of 3 elements, the first is a string, the abbreviation of the method, the second is a string, the formula in LaTeX format, and the last is an integer, the approximate dataset size. Note that for the third sub-question, you don't need to figure out the exact value, just provide the approximate value that appears on the horizontal axis of the figure.",
