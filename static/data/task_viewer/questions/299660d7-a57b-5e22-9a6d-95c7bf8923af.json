    "answer_format": "Your answer should be a list of three elements. The first element should be a string of free-form natural English describing the difference between methods of two works. The second element should be a string from [\"Synatra\", \"AgentTrek\"]. The third element should be a float in [0, 100] as the difference of the success rates of two models.",
