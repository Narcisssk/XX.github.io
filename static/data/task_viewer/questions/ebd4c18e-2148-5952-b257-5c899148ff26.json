            "reference_answer": "The paper proposes a novel approach to \"red teaming\" language models (LMs) using other LMs. This means using one LM to generate test cases (input prompts) that can uncover harmful outputs from another LM. The key idea is to leverage the generative capabilities of LMs to automatically generate a large and diverse set of test cases, which can reveal various failure modes and potential harmful behaviors of the target LM. This approach complements manual testing and can help identify and mitigate risks before deploying LMs in real-world applications.",
