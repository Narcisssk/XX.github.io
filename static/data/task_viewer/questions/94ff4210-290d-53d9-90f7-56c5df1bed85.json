Annotating a set of review segments with binary labels, i.e., to determine whether they are 'good' or 'bad' justifications. 2. Training a classifier on the annotated subset and applying it to distantly label all the review segments to extract 'good' justifications for each user and item pair. 3. Applying fine-grained aspect extraction for the extracted justifications, and building user personas and item profiles.",
