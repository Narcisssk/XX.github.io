    "abstract": "A GOOD AUDIO CODEC FOR LIVE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS TELECOMMUNICATION IS CHARACTERIZED BY THREE KEY PROPERTIES: (1) COMPRESSION, I.E. THE BITRATE THAT IS REQUIRED TO TRANSMIT THE SIGNAL SHOULD BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE; (2) LATENCY, I.E. ENCODING AND DECODING THE SIGNAL NEEDS TO BE FAST ENOUGH TO ENABLE COMMUNICATION WITHOUT OR WITH ONLY MINIMAL NOTICEABLE DELAY; AND (3) RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY OF THE SIGNAL. IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE AN OPEN-SOURCE, STREAMABLE, AND REAL-TIME NEURAL AUDIO CODEC THAT ACHIEVES STRONG PERFORMANCE ALONG ALL THREE AXES: IT CAN RECONSTRUCT HIGHLY NATURAL SOUNDING 48 KHZ SPEECH SIGNALS WHILE OPERATING AT ONLY 12 KBPS AND RUNNING WITH LESS THAN 6 MS (GPU)/10 MS (CPU) LATENCY. AN EFFICIENT TRAINING PARADIGM IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED FOR DEVELOPING SUCH NEURAL AUDIO CODECS FOR REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS. BOTH OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE EVALUATIONS USING THE VCTK CORPUS ARE PROVIDED. TO SUM UP, AUDIODEC IS A WELL-DEVELOPED PLUG-AND-PLAY BENCHMARK FOR AUDIO CODEC APPLICATIONS.",
