However, LLMs often generate incorrect query statements due to the lack of relevant knowledge in the previous methods. To address this, we propose a framework called Augmenting Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs with Graph Structures in Knowledge Base Question Answering (ARG-KBQA), which retrieves question-related graph structures to improve the performance of LLMs. Unlike other methods that directly retrieve relations or triples from KBs, we introduce an unsupervised two-stage ranker to perform multi-hop beam search on KBs, which could provide LLMs with more relevant information to the questions. Experimental results demonstrate that ARG-KBQA sets a new state-of-the-art on GrailQA and WebQSP under the few-shot setting. Additionally, ARG-KBQA significantly outperforms previous few-shot methods on questions with unseen query statement in the training data.\"\n}\n",
