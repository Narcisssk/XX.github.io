    "abstract": "Prior research on policy adaptation in multi-agent games has often relied on online interaction with the target agent in training, which can be expensive and impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by recent progress in offline reinforcement learn- ing, this paper studies offline policy adaptation, which aims to utilize the target agentâ€™s behavior data to exploit its weakness or enable effective cooperation. We investigate its distinct challenges of distributional shift and risk-free deviation, and propose a novel learning objective, conservative offline adaptation, that optimizes the worst-case performance against any dataset consistent proxy models. We pro- pose an efficient algorithm called Constrained Self-Play (CSP) that incorporates dataset information into regularized policy learning. We prove that CSP learns a near-optimal risk-free offline adaptation policy upon convergence. Empirical results demonstrate that CSP outperforms non-conservative baselines in various environments, including Maze, predator-prey, MuJoCo, and Google Football.",
