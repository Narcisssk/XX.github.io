    "abstract": "Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have made significant advances across various fields. One of the most popular research areas involves applying these agents to video games. Traditionally, these methods have relied on game APIs to access in-game environmental and action data. However, this approach is limited by the availability of APIs and does not reflect how humans play games. With the advent of vision language models (VLMs), agents now have enhanced visual understanding capabilities, enabling them to interact with games using only visual inputs. Despite these advances, current approaches still face challenges in action-oriented tasks, particularly in action role-playing games (ARPGs), where reinforcement learning methods are prevalent but suffer from poor generalization and require extensive training. To address these limitations, we select an ARPG, ``Black Myth: Wukong'', as a research platform to explore the capability boundaries of existing VLMs in scenarios requiring visual-only input and complex action output. We define 12 tasks within the game, with 75% focusing on combat, and incorporate several state-of-the-art VLMs into this benchmark. Additionally, we will release a human operation dataset containing recorded gameplay videos and operation logs, including mouse and keyboard actions. Moreover, we propose a novel VARP (Vision Action Role-Playing) agent framework, consisting of an action planning system and a human-guided trajectory system. Our framework demonstrates the ability to perform basic tasks and succeed in 90% of easy and medium-level combat scenarios. This research aims to provide new insights and directions for applying multimodal agents in complex action game environments. The code and datasets will be made available at https://varp-agent.github.io/.",
