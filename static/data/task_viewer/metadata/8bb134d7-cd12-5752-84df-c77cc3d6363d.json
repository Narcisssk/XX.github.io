    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are often used in face sketch synthesis due to their powerful ability in image generation. However, most GAN based synthesis methods took the entire face as the minimum unit. Differently, we propose a novel fine-granularity face sketch synthesis framework in this paper. The core idea is to first capture local information at a fine granularity (i.e., facial component), and then generate a complete face sketch based on the fine-grained information. Specifically, we partition the face sketch into multiple components, and then train a parallel network for each component. A condition enhanced detail repair network is further designed to correct the mismatches and deformations produced during parallel generation. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods from both the qualitative and quantitative perspectives.",
