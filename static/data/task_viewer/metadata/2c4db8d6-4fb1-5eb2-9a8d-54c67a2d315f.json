    "abstract": "Sketching is a powerful tool for creating abstract images that are sparse but meaningful. Sketch understanding poses fundamental challenges for general-purpose vision algorithms because it requires robustness to the sparsity of sketches relative to natural visual inputs and because it demands tolerance for semantic ambiguity, as sketches can reliably evoke multiple meanings. While current vision algorithms have achieved high performance on a variety of visual tasks, it remains unclear to what extent they understand sketches in a human-like way. Here we introduce $\\texttt{SEVA}$, a new benchmark dataset containing approximately 90K human-generated sketches of 128 object concepts produced under different time constraints, and thus systematically varying in sparsity. We evaluated a suite of state-of-the-art vision algorithms on their ability to correctly identify the target concept depicted in these sketches and to generate responses that are strongly aligned with human response patterns on the same sketch recognition task. We found that vision algorithms that better predicted human sketch recognition performance also better approximated human uncertainty about sketch meaning, but there remains a sizable gap between model and human response patterns. To explore the potential of models that emulate human visual abstraction in generative tasks, we conducted further evaluations of a recently developed sketch generation algorithm (Vinker et al., 2022) capable of generating sketches that vary in sparsity. We hope that public release of this dataset and evaluation protocol will catalyze progress towards algorithms with enhanced capacities for human-like visual abstraction.",
