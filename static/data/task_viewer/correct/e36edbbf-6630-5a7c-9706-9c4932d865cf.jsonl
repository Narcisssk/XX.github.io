{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Bergen Department of Cognitive Science, University of California San Diego {j1michae,bkbergen}@ucsd.edu\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Does inverse scaling only occur as a function of model size, or can it also occur over the course of training? We carry out an exploratory study investigating whether the performance of language models on specifc tasks can decrease (while general performance remains high) during training on the language modeling task. We fnd 8 tasks on which Pythia 12B (Biderman et al., 2023) shows decreased performance over the course of training. Five of these tasks (TRUTHFULQA-MC1, TRUTHFULQAMC2, HINDSIGHT NEGLECT, MEMO TRAP, and PATTERN MATCH SUPPRESSION) additionally show a consistent relationship whereby larger language models show a greater decrease in performance the more they are trained, despite showing standard (positive) scaling overall. This highlights the importance of testing performance at all relevant benchmarks any time models are trained on additional data, even if their overall performance improves.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"For language models, bigger is usually better. Recent research has found that both increased number of model parameters and increased size of the training dataset positively infuence model performance (Brown et al., 2020; Kaplan et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Clark et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Taylor et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a). One particularly striking pattern that has been reported is emergence, a nonlinearity in these relationships, where at a particular scale, language models improve rapidly at a given task (Wei et al., 2022).\\nHowever, while increased scale usually leads to improved performance, on certain tasks it correlates with decreased performance. This is known as inverse scaling (Lin et al., 2022). An example of a task on which inverse scaling is observed is the TruthfulQA benchmark, where larger language models are more likely to predict popular misconceptions over statements of fact (Lin et al., 2022). More recently, additional tasks that reportedly show such an effect have been identifed as part of the Inverse Scaling Prize (McKenzie et al., 2023b), as well as by other researchers (Jang et al., 2023; Michaelov and Bergen, 2023).\\n\\nInverse scaling is a serious concern for several reasons. At a high level, inverse scaling may indicate \\u2018outer misalignment\\u2019 (Perez et al., 2022) between the model training approach and the purposes to which they are applied. The lack of robustness observed in inverse scaling phenomena may thus indicate that the apparent successes of specifc language models at a wide range of benchmarks (e.g., Hendrycks et al., 2021; Srivastava et al., 2022) do not necessarily entail that they have the capability ostensibly being tested (Bowman and Dahl, 2021; Raji et al., 2021).\\nThe existence of inverse scaling is also concerning because of the possibility of other as yet unidentifed tasks where performance similarly scales inversely with model size. Models that perform well on a variety of tasks may well present deteriorating performance in unseen tasks with scale, even as performance at established benchmarks increases. This is of particular concern if better performance at established benchmarks and more natural-seeming output leads users to place more trust in such models as general-purpose natural language understanding systems (see, e.g., Bender et al., 2021, for general discussion of such risks).\\nFinally, inverse scaling is also of concern because it is often unpredictable. In the same way that certain capabilities appear to emerge at scale (Wei et al., 2022), inverse scaling also appears or accelerates at given scales. For example, as McKenzie et al. (2022b) show, the performance of Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) and Plain LM (Ganguli et al., 2022) at the Inverse Scaling Prize\\u2019s negated question-answering task (NEQA) appears to be stable or even increasing as model size increases, only dropping as model size increases to around 7 billion parameters and beyond (McKenzie et al., 2022b). Thus, inverse scaling may occur not just for unidentifed tasks, but also for well-established tasks: a model architecture that performs well at a benchmark at a small scale may suddenly perform surprisingly worse as scale increases\\u2013it is not safe to assume that performance will continue to improve or even remain stable.\\n\\nWhile previous work has focused on inverse scaling based on the number of model parameters (Lin et al., 2022; McKenzie et al., 2022a,b, 2023a; Jang et al., 2023; Michaelov and Bergen, 2023); as discussed, scaling effects more generally occur not just in relation to model size but also as a function of training data quantity. Recent work has shown that this latter effect has been substantially underestimated (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a). Thus, in the present study, we consider the possibility of inverse scaling over the course of pretraining; that is, the hypothesized situation where performance on some tasks decreases as the total quantity of training data increases. If inverse scaling of this type exists, it may be more problematic than inverse scaling as a function of model size, because if performance at a given task can degrade over the course of pretraining even as the performance at the majority of tasks improves, a specifc model that has previously performed well at a given task may unexpectedly show decreased performance later in training.\\nWe test how well the 8 models of the Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) suite perform at 12 tasks over the course of training. These tasks are the 10 multiple-choice tasks that won the Inverse Scaling Challenge (McKenzie et al., 2022b), plus the two multiple-choice versions of the TruthfulQA benchmark, on which language models have also been found to show inverse scaling (Lin et al., 2022). The aim of this study is therefore an exploratory analysis to see whether tasks that show inverse scaling as model parameter size increases also show inverse scaling over the course of training.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"TRUTHFULQA-MC1 is the frst multiple-choice variant of TRUTHFULQA (Lin et al., 2022), which tests whether language models fnd common misconceptions or statements of fact more predictable in a given context. In this version, there is one true option and the remainder are false. For example, for the prompt what should you take for a viral infection?, the true answer is you should take a rest and drink fuids, and other answers include you should take a full course of antibiotics. The language model is considered to respond correctly if the probability of the correct answer is higher than any other.\\n\\nTRUTHFULQA-MC2 is an alternative multiplechoice variant of TRUTHFULQA in which there are often multiple correct answers. Here, the model is considered to respond correctly if the total probability of correct responses is greater than that of incorrect responses.\\nSIG FIGS, like all the Inverse Scaling Prize tasks, is a multiple-choice task with one correct answer. It also has two incorrect answers, and the model is considered to respond correctly if the correct answer has the highest probability. The task itself tests whether, when prompted to round a number to a number of signifcant fgures, the language model fnds the number rounded correctly to be more probable or the number rounded to the same number of decimal places.\\nNEQA is a zero-shot task with negated questions such as As the barometer reading goes lower there is not a greater chance of A. sunshine B. getting wet.\\nREDEFINE is a zero-shot task where expressions are redefned in a range of ways, and then questions are asked are asked about these redefned expressions\\u2014e.g., a prompt may ask for the frst digit of $5+15$ , where $5+15$ is frst redefned as a text string rather than an equation. The task tests whether the language model does indeed treat the expression in the redefned way rather than its usual interpretation.\\nMEMO TRAP is a task where a language model is instructed to write a famous quote with a specifc last word, e.g., write a quote that ends in the word \\u201cheavy\\u201d: Absence makes the heart grow. In this case, the correct answer would be heavy and not the expected fonder.\\nHINDSIGHT NEGLECT is a few-shot multiplechoice task where the input contains information about a bet and its outcome and the task is to correctly determine whether or not the bet should have been taken. In the task, a number of examples are provided where the expected value aligns with the result (if the task has a positive expected value, the individual taking the bet wins, and if it has a negative one, the individual taking the bet loses). For the fnal question (the one that is answered for the task), the value won or lost does not align (the individual either wins a bet with a negative expected value or loses one with a positive expected value).\\n\\nINTO THE UNKNOWN is a task that involves a description of a setting and a question, with the twist that the task is to identify which of two pieces of information would help to answer the question. One option (the correct answer) contains new information and the other repeats information from the original description.\\nMODUS TOLLENS tests whether language models can make predictions in line with the modus tollens form of deductive inference, i.e., \\u2018[i]f $p$ , then $q$ ; not $q$ ; therefore, not $p'$ (McKenzie et al., 2023b). The task involves an example of such an inference, and then a question of whether the conclusion is valid or not.\\nPATTERN MATCH SUPPRESSION tests whether language models can violate a repeated pattern. For example, one prompt is to generate a sequence of 6 symbols alternating between two symbols $(A\\\\,B)$ but ending unexpectedly. A, B, A, B, $A$ , with possible answers $A$ or $B$ .\\nRESISITING CORRECTION is a few-shot task, with the instruction to repeat a text without changing it and two examples. In the fnal example, the sentence to be repeated includes an atypicality, e.g., spelling mistake or a switched word of a famous quote. The task tests whether the model follows the instruction and replicates the atypical, or whether it \\u2018corrects\\u2019 it.\\nREPETITIVE ALGEBRA is a few-shot task based on simple algebra questions. Until the penultimate question, all questions have the same answer (provided in the prompt), and the penultimate question has an answer that differs (also provided in the prompt). For the fnal question that needs to be answered, the answer is the same as the initial answers. The task tests which of the two answers (initial or penulatimate) the model predicts to be more likely.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We use the 70 million parameter (70M), 160M, 410M, 1B, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, and 12B Pythia models (Biderman et al., 2023). The models were trained on the autoregressive language modeling task on The Pile (Gao et al., 2020), an 800GB text dataset comprising 300 billion tokens. All models were trained on this dataset, with checkpoints released at every 2 billion tokens of training. Given that scaling is often considered on a logarithmic scale, we tested each model\\u2019s performance at 8 checkpoints based on powers of 2: checkpoint 2 (4 billion tokens), checkpoint 4 (8B tokens), checkpoint 8 (16B), checkpoint 16 (32B), checkpoint 32 (64B), checkpoint 64 (128B), checkpoint 128 (256B), and checkpoint 143 (300B tokens, i.e., fully trained).\\n\\nWe run our analyses of model performance using the Language Model Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2021). All code, data, and statistical analyses are provided at https:\\/\\/github.com\\/ jmichaelov\\/emergent-inabilities.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Model performance at each task is shown in Figure 1. In order to quantify the patterns observed, we also ft a least-squares linear regression for each dataset, with the logarithm (base 10) of model parameters, the logarithm (base 10) of training tokens, and the interaction between them as predictors of task accuracy. All variables were z-scored. The results of these tests are shown in Table 1.\\nThe clearest inverse scaling effects can be seen with TRUTHFULQA-MC2\\u2014larger models perform worse, performance overall decreases with number of training tokens, and the rate at which performance deteriorates with training tokens increases with model size. Inferential statistics show a negative effect of number of parameters, number of training tokens, and their interaction. In other words, the regression predicts that model performance decreases with number of parameters and training tokens; and in addition, that the larger a model is, the more there is a decrease in performance as the model continues to train. Whether this pattern of statistical results is specifc to the tasks used in the present work or to all tasks that show inverse scaling is a question for future work. However, it does also appear to be present for most of the other tasks clearly displaying inverse scaling, namely, HINDSIGHT NEGLECT, MEMO TRAP, PATTERN MATCH SUPPRESSION, and TRUTHFULQA-MC1.\\nSome of the remaining tasks, namely INTO THE UNKNOWN, MODUS TOLLENS, NEQA, and SIG FIGS display no clear pattern across models. But when focusing on just the two largest models, REDEFINE appears to show inverse scaling over the course of training, and the largest (12 billion parameter) model shows inverse scaling during training on REPETITIVE ALGEBRA and RESISTING CORRECTION. These may be a case of emergent inverse scaling (i.e., nonlinearities that cannot be accounted for using linear statistical models), especially in the case of RESISTING CORRECTION, but models with a larger number of parameters would be needed to verify this.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We fnd clear evidence of inverse scaling over the course of training on TRUTHFULQA-MC1, TRUTHFULQA-MC2, HINDSIGHT NEGLECT,\\nMEMO TRAP, and PATTERN MATCH SUPPRESSION, as well as possible evidence of the same phenomenon on REDEFINE, REPETITIVE ALGEBRA, RESISTING CORRECTION for the largest model or models. In addition, RESISTING CORRECTION appears to present an example of emergence in inverse scaling over the course of training\\u2014performance only decreases with training on the largest model.\\nAt the time of initial writing, this study was the frst to have identifed an example of inverse scaling over the course of pretraining. Since then, an offcial Inverse Scaling Prize paper has been released (McKenzie et al., 2023b). In addition to exploring scaling in terms of the number of foating point operations (FLOPs) needed to train each model, McKenzie et al. (2023b) also analyze the performance of different sizes of the Anthropic LM model (2M, 13M, 42M, 197M, 805M, 3B, 13B, 52B) over the course of training on 400B tokens, providing a valuable point of comparison. On the whole, their results are similar to ours over the same scales. At the larger scale, they fnd that the 13B and 52B models begin to show inverse scaling on NEQA, SIG FIGS, and INTO THE UNKNOWN. Conversely, only the 52B model begins to show inverse scaling on RESISTING CORRELATION.\\nMcKenzie et al. (2023b) also classify the tasks into different types.1 These classes do not clearly delineate between ones that show inverse scaling and ones that do not based on either our analyses or their analyses. Nonetheless, they provide a valuable starting point for considering the kinds of features of tasks that may lead to different scaling patterns.\\nIndeed, the question of whether there are consistent scaling patterns based on task features remains an open one. We fnd several clear cases of inverse scaling that share the pattern of model performance decreasing more rapidly over the course of training as the number of model parameters increases. In several cases there is only a decrease in performance in the largest models. These are not necessarily different phenomena; it may be that the threshold of number of parameters and tokens for tasks like TRUTHFULQA-MC2 is simply lower than for tasks like RESISTING CORRECTION. Additionally, it is not clear whether the main pattern of inverse scaling that we identify\\u2014namely, a greater decrease in performance during training in the largest models\\u2014is a general feature of inverse scaling, or only due to the fact that we use tasks already known to show inverse scaling as models increase in number of parameters. Future work should establish what kinds of relationships (if any) hold between inverse scaling as a function of model parameters and inverse scaling as a function of training data.\\n\\nPerhaps the main takeaway of the present study is that of instability in model performance. As we see with Pythia 12B on the RESISTING CORRECTION task, a model that was previously among the best at a given task can relatively suddenly experience decreased performance as it continues to train. Good performance on a task at one stage doesn\\u2019t guarantee continued good performance, even in cases where the model only continues to be trained on text data. This highlights the importance of regular and rigorous evaluation. For this reason, users of models subject to updates would be well advised to verify continuing performance regularly, and it is incumbent on parties who provide such models for use in applications to notify users of updates.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In this study, we set out to investigate whether inverse scaling can occur not only as a function of number of model parameters, but also number of training tokens. We fnd clear evidence that it does occur with the Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) suite of models on fve of the twelve tasks analyzed, and additional evidence that it may occur on up to eight.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The main limitations of this study relate to the models used and tasks evaluated. With respect to the former, our analysis is limited to 8 models at various stages in their training. While this means that we can make the inference that the performance of a specifc model can deteriorate over the course of training, it also means that it is possible that some of the models have idiosyncratic features that would not generalize to other models of the same size or with the same amount of training data.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "[Thought]: The most relevant result is from the chunk of text in the paper with the specified `pdf_id` and `primary_key`. It mentions that 4 GeForce RTX 2080 GPUs were used to train a model with a batch size of 28 per GPU. This is the closest match to the information we need. However, the paper does not explicitly state the number of GPUs required for a 70M model with the GPT-3 batch sizes.
