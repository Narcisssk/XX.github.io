{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

To the best of our knowledge,\\nLLM4Mat-Bench is the most extensive benchmark to date for assessing the efficacy of language\\nmodels in materials property prediction. The dataset comprises approximately two million samples,\\nsourced from ten publicly available materials sources, each containing between 10K and 1M structure\\nsamples. LLM4Mat-Bench encompasses several tasks, including the prediction of electronic, elastic,\\nand thermodynamic properties based on a material\\u2019s composition, crystal information file (CIF), or\\ntextual description of its structure. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to evaluate several LLMs of different\\nsizes, namely LLM-Prop [35] (35M parameters), MatBERT [41] (109.5M parameters), and Llama\\n2 [39] (7B parameters).

In this section, we describe each data source and discuss how we accessed its data.\\n2.1.1\\nData sources\\nhMOF [42] is a publicly available database2 consisting of about 160K Metal-Organic Frameworks\\n(MOFs), generated by Wilmer et al. using computational approaches. Materials Project (MP) [21] is\\na database with around 150K materials, offering free API access3 for data retrieval, including CIF\\nfiles and material properties. The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) [23] is a publicly\\naccessible database4 of 1.2M materials, containing DFT-calculated thermodynamic and structural\\nproperties, created at Northwestern University. OMDB [3] is an organic materials database with\\nabout 12K structures and related electronic band structure properties, freely available5. JARVIS-DFT\\n[8, 9] is a repository created by NIST researchers, containing around 75.9K material structures\\nwith downloadable properties6. QMOF [33, 34] is a quantum-chemical property database of over\\n16K MOFs, accessible via GitHub7. JARVIS-QETB [17] is a NIST-created database8 of nearly one\\nmillion materials with tight-binding parameters for 65 elements. GNoME is a database of 381K\\nnew stable materials discovered by Merchant et al. [28] using graph networks and DFT, available on\\nGitHub9. Cantor HEA [25] is a DFT dataset of formation energies for 84K alloy structures, available\\non Zenodo10. SNUMAT is a database with around 10K experimentally synthesized materials and\\nDFT properties, accessible via API11.\\n2.1.2\\nCollecting crystal information files (CIFs) and materials property\\nCrystal structure files (CIFs), material compositions, and material properties were collected from\\npublicly accessible sources described in Section 2.1.1. Data collection was facilitated by APIs and\\n2https:\\/\\/mof.tech.northwestern.edu\\/\\n3https:\\/\\/next-gen.materialsproject.org\\/api\\n4https:\\/\\/www.oqmd.org\\/\\n5https:\\/\\/omdb.mathub.io\\/\\n6https:\\/\\/jarvis.nist.gov\\/jarvisdft\\n7https:\\/\\/github.com\\/Andrew-S-Rosen\\/QMOF\\n8https:\\/\\/jarvis.nist.gov\\/jarvisqetb\\/\\n9https:\\/\\/github.com\\/google-deepmind\\/materials_discovery\\/blob\\/main\\/DATASET.md\\n10https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.10854500\\n11https:\\/\\/www.snumat.com\\/apis\\n2\\ndirect download links provided by the respective databases. For databases such as Materials Project,\\nOMDB, SNUMAT, JARVIS-DFT, and JARVIS-QETB, user registration is required for access, while\\ndatabases like hMOF, QMOF, OQMD, and GNoME allow direct data access without registration.\\nFrom each source, we obtained CIFs and associated material properties. Although the Materials\\nProject and JARVIS-DFT databases offer a broader range of properties, we selected a subset\\u201410 and\\n20 properties respectively\\u2014that adequately represents the data within our benchmark, based on the\\nnumber of data points available for each property. This selection was made to optimize computational\\nefficiency when training models across the 65 properties included in LLM4Mat-Bench.\\n2.1.3\\nGenerating the textual description of crystal structure\\nLLMs perform better with textual input, and Rubungo et al. [35], Korolev and Protsenko [24], Qu\\net al. [30] have demonstrated that LLMs can effectively learn the structural representation of a crystal\\nfrom its textual description, outperforming graph neural network (GNN)-based models that directly\\nutilize the crystal structure for property prediction. Crystal structures are typically described in\\nfile formats such as Crystallographic Information File (CIF) which include predominantly numbers\\ndescribing lattice vectors and atomic coordinates and are less amenable to LLMs. Instead of directly\\nusing these as inputs, we use Robocrystallographer [21] to deterministically generate texts that are\\nmore descriptive of crystal structures from CIF files. Robocrystallographer was developed and has\\nbeen used by the Materials Project team to auto-generate texts for their database. Given a structure,\\nRobocrystallographer leverages predefined rules and existing libraries to extract chemical and struc-\\ntural information, including oxidation states, global structural descriptions (symmetry information,\\nprototype matching, structural fingerprint calculations etc.), and local structural descriptions (e.g.\\nbonding and neighbor analysis, connectivity). This method not only generate deterministic and\\nhuman-readable texts, but also ensures no data contamination in our fine-tuned LLMs, as the data\\nsources mentioned do not include these crystal text descriptions.\\nTable 1: LLM4Mat-Bench statistics.\\nData source\\n# Structure files\\n# Structure-Description pairs\\n# Tokens (Words)\\n# Avg. subword tokens\\/Sample\\n# Properties\\nTotal\\nTrain\\nValidation\\nTest\\nComposition\\nStructure\\nDescription\\nComposition\\nStructure\\nDescription\\nOQMD [23]\\n1,008,266\\n964,403\\n771,522\\n96,440\\n96,441\\n964K\\n96M\\n244M\\n5.3\\n635.4\\n347.3\\n2\\nJARVIS-QETB [17]\\n829,576\\n623,989\\n499,191\\n62,399\\n62,399\\n624K\\n45M\\n90M\\n3.5\\n466.6\\n202.5\\n4\\nGNoME [28]\\n381,000\\n376,276\\n301,020\\n37,628\\n37,628\\n830K\\n78M\\n508M\\n9.7\\n1185.3\\n1711.3\\n6\\nMaterials Project [21]\\n146,143\\n146,143\\n125,825\\n10,000\\n10,318\\n272K\\n37M\\n157M\\n6.8\\n1611.8\\n1467.3\\n10\\nhMOF [42]\\n133,524\\n132,743\\n106,194\\n13,274\\n13,275\\n449K\\n96M\\n581M\\n14.9\\n4583.9\\n5629.3\\n7\\nCantor HEA [25]\\n84,024\\n84,019\\n67,215\\n8,402\\n8,402\\n84K\\n11M\\n251M\\n9.5\\n868.4\\n4988.6\\n4\\nJARVIS-DFT [8, 9]\\n75,965\\n75,965\\n60,772\\n7,596\\n7,597\\n76K\\n9M\\n25M\\n5.0\\n786.0\\n455.9\\n20\\nQMOF [33, 34]\\n16,340\\n7,656\\n6,124\\n766\\n766\\n8K\\n7M\\n22M\\n14.0\\n5876.4\\n3668.0\\n4\\nOMDB [3]\\n12,500\\n12,122\\n9,697\\n1,212\\n1,213\\n66K\\n8M\\n14M\\n14.8\\n4097.4\\n1496.6\\n1\\nSNUMAT 12\\n10,481\\n10,372\\n8,297\\n1,037\\n1,038\\n16K\\n2M\\n4M\\n5.9\\n1244.5\\n539.1\\n7\\nTotal\\n2,697,779\\n1,978,985\\n1,592,315\\n193,357\\n193,313\\n4.7M\\n615.5M\\n3.1B\\n7.9\\n1559.7\\n1703.6\\n65\\nTable 2: Comparing the LLM4Mat-Bench with other existing benchmarks.\\nBenchmark\\n# Data Sources\\n# Distinct Properties\\n# Properties\\/# Samples\\n# Properties\\/Task Type\\nMaterial Representations\\n<10k\\n10-100k\\n100k+\\nRegression\\nClassification\\nComposition\\nStructure\\nDescription\\nMatBench [13]\\n6\\n10\\n7\\n3\\n3\\n10\\n3\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2717\\nTextEdge [35]\\n1\\n3\\n0\\n0\\n3\\n2\\n1\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2717\\n\\u2713\\nLLM4Mat-Bench (Ours)\\n10\\n45\\n5\\n31\\n29\\n60\\n5\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n\\u2713\\n2.2\\nData Statistics\\nAs Table 1 shows, LLM4Mat-Bench comprises 2,697,779 structure files, which, after pairing with\\ndescriptions generated by Robocrystallographer and filtering out descriptions with fewer than five\\nwords, result in 1,978,985 composition-structure-description pairs13. The reduction in sample count\\nis also due to Robocrystallographer\\u2019s inability to describe certain CIF files. The total samples for\\neach dataset in LLM4Mat-Bench are randomly split into 80%, 10%, and 10% for training, validation,\\nand testing, respectively. OQMD has the highest number of samples at 964,403, while QMOF has\\nthe fewest with 7,656 samples. On average, each dataset in LLM4Mat-Bench contains approximately\\n200,000 samples.\\nIn LLM4Mat-Bench, when combined, textual descriptions contain 3.1 billion tokens, crystal structures\\n615 million, and compositions 4.7 million14. OQMD leads in composition tokens (964K), while\\n13The total number of pairs were 2,433,688, after removing about 454703 duplicated pairs across datasets, it\\nresulted to 1,978,985 pairs.\\n14We used NLTK toolkit as a tokenizer to count the number of words\\/tokens.\\n3\\nhMOF has the most description tokens (581M). For CIFs, both OQMD and hMOF have around 96M\\ntokens. On average, compositions have 8 subword tokens per sample, CIFs 1600, and descriptions\\n1700. hMOF averages the longest inputs for compositions (14.9) and descriptions (5629), while\\nQMOF leads in structures (5876.4)15. JARVIS-DFT has the most tasks with 20 properties, followed\\nby Materials Project with 10, and OMDB with one. Details on sample counts are in Section 3.2.\\nLLM4Mat-Bench provides the most comprehensive dataset compared to existing benchmarks, with\\nthe largest number of samples, properties, and tasks, including 60 regression and 5 classification tasks\\n(see Table 2). It also offers more diverse material representations, incorporating chemical formulas,\\ncrystal structures, and crystal text descriptions. In contrast, MatBench [13] and TextEdge [35] have\\nfewer tasks and less representation diversity, with MatBench lacking crystal text descriptions and\\nTextEdge missing material compositions and crystal structures.\\n2.3\\nData Quality\\nSince Robocrystallographer generates crystal text descriptions in a deterministic manner following\\npredefined and well-validated rules [21], these texts should faithfully describe the crystal structures\\nused to generate them. Regarding the quality of labels, they are calculated from simulations and\\nare usually considered noise-free. Properties data except those from JARVIS-QETB and hMOF\\nare obtained from DFT, which is based on fundamental quantum mechanical equations. While\\nDFT calculations can still be performed with different levels of approximations and fidelity, the\\nDFT-calculated properties are usually considered to be highly reliable and are routinely used as\\nnoise-free ground truths for ML models in the materials science community.\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
