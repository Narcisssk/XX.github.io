{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Most prior KGC\\nwork focuses on learning embeddings for en-\\ntities and relations through a simple scoring\\nfunction. Yet, a higher-dimensional embedding\\nspace is usually required for a better reasoning\\ncapability, which leads to a larger model size\\nand hinders applicability to real-world prob-\\nlems (e.g., large-scale KGs or mobile\\/edge\\ncomputing). A lightweight modularized KGC\\nsolution, called GreenKGC, is proposed in this\\nwork to address this issue. GreenKGC consists\\nof three modules: representation learning, fea-\\nture pruning, and decision learning, to extract\\ndiscriminant KG features and make accurate\\npredictions on missing relationships using clas-\\nsifiers and negative sampling. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate that, in low dimensions,\\nGreenKGC can outperform SOTA methods in\\nmost datasets. In addition, low-dimensional\\nGreenKGC can achieve competitive or even\\nbetter performance against high-dimensional\\nmodels with a much smaller model size. We\\nmake our code publicly available.1\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nKnowledge graphs (KGs) store human knowledge\\nin a graph-structured format, where nodes and\\nedges denote entities and relations, respectively. A\\n(head entity, relation, tail entity) factual triple, de-\\nnoted by (h, r, t), is a basic component in KGs. In\\nmany knowledge-centric artificial intelligence (AI)\\napplications, such as question answering (Huang\\net al., 2019; Saxena et al., 2020), information ex-\\ntraction (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Daiber et al., 2013),\\nand recommendation (Wang et al., 2019; Xian et al.,\\n2019), KG plays an important role as it provides\\nexplainable reasoning paths to predictions. How-\\never, most KGs suffer from the incompleteness\\n1https:\\/\\/github.com\\/yunchengwang\\/Gree\\nnKGC\\nFigure 1: MRR versus the number of free parameters in\\nKGE methods against FB15K-237 (left) and YAGO3-10\\ndataset (right). When a model has fewer parameters, its\\nperformance is poorer. Also, the larger dataset, YAGO3-\\n10, demands more parameters than the smaller dataset,\\nFB15k-237, to achieve satisfactory results.\\nproblem; namely, a large number of factual triples\\nare missing, leading to performance degradation\\nin downstream applications. Thus, there is grow-\\ning interest in developing KG completion (KGC)\\nmethods to solve the incompleteness problem by\\ninferring undiscovered factual triples based on ex-\\nisting ones. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE)\\nmethods have been widely used to solve the in-\\ncompleteness problem. Embeddings for entities\\nand relations are stored as model parameters and\\nupdated by maximizing triple scores among ob-\\nserved triples while minimizing those among neg-\\native triples. The number of free parameters in\\na KGE model is linear to the embedding dimen-\\nsion and the number of entities and relations in\\nKGs, i.e. O((|E| + |R|)d), where |E| is the num-\\nber of entities, |R| is the number of relations, and\\nd is the embedding dimension. Since KGE mod-\\nels usually require a higher-dimensional embed-\\nding space for a better reasoning capability, they re-\\nquire large model sizes (i.e. parameter numbers) to\\nachieve satisfactory performance as demonstrated\\nin Fig. 1. To this end, it is challenging for them\\nto handle large-scale KGs with lots of entities and\\nrelations in resource-constrained platforms such\\nas mobile\\/edge computing. A KGC method that\\n10596\\n\",\"page_number\":1}\n{\"page_content\":\"has good reasoning capability in low dimensions is\\ndesired (Kuo and Madni, 2022).\\nThe requirement of high-dimensional embed-\\ndings for popular KGE methods comes from\\nthe over-simplified scoring functions (Xiao et al.,\\n2015). Thus, classification-based KGC methods,\\nsuch as ConvE (Dettmers et al., 2018), aim to in-\\ncrease the reasoning capabilities in low dimensions\\nby adopting neural networks (NNs) as powerful\\ndecoders. As a result, they are more efficient in pa-\\nrameter scaling than KGE models (Dettmers et al.,\\n2018). However, NNs demand longer inference\\ntime and more computation power due to their\\ndeep architectures. The long inference time of\\nthe classification-based methods also limits their\\napplicability to some tasks that require real-time\\ninference. Recently, DualDE (Zhu et al., 2022) ap-\\nplied Knowledge Distillation (KD) (Hinton et al.,\\n2015) to train powerful low-dimensional embed-\\ndings. Yet, it demands three stages of embedding\\ntraining: 1) training high-dimensional KGE, 2)\\ntraining low-dimensional KGE with the guidance\\nof high-dimensional KGE, and 3) multiple rounds\\nof student-teacher interactions. Its training process\\nis time-consuming and may fail to converge when\\nthe embeddings are not well-initialized.\\nHere, we propose a new KGC method that works\\nwell under low dimensions and name it GreenKGC.\\nGreenKGC consists of three modules: 1) represen-\\ntation learning, 2) feature pruning, and 3) decision\\nlearning. Each of them is trained independently. In\\nModule 1, we leverage a KGE method, called the\\nbaseline method, to learn high-dimensional entity\\nand relation representations. In Module 2, a feature\\npruning process is applied to the high-dimensional\\nentity and relation representations to yield discrim-\\ninant low-dimensional features for triples. In ad-\\ndition, we observe that some feature dimensions\\nare more powerful than others in different relations.\\nThus, we group relations with similar discriminant\\nfeature dimensions for parameter savings and bet-\\nter performance. In Module 3, we train a binary\\nclassifier for each relation group so that it can pre-\\ndict triple\\u2019s score in inference. The score is a soft\\nprediction between 0 and 1, which indicates the\\nprobability of whether a certain triple exists or not.\\nFinally, we propose two novel negative sampling\\nschemes, embedding-based and ontology-based,\\nfor classifier training in this work. They are used\\nfor hard negative mining, where these hard nega-\\ntives cannot be correctly predicted by the baseline\\nKGE methods.\\nWe conduct extensive experiments and compare\\nthe performance and model sizes of GreenKGC\\nwith several representative KGC methods on link\\nprediction datasets. Experimental results show that\\nGreenKGC can achieve good performance in low\\ndimensions, i.e. 8, 16, 32 dimensions, compared\\nwith SOTA low-dimensional methods. In addi-\\ntion, GreenKGC shows competitive or better per-\\nformance compared to the high-dimensional KGE\\nmethods with a much smaller model size. We\\nalso conduct experiments on a large-scale link pre-\\ndiction datasets with over 2.5M entities and show\\nthat GreenKGC can perform well with much fewer\\nmodel parameters. Ablation studies are also con-\\nducted to show the effectiveness of each module in\\nGreenKGC.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\n2.1\\nKGE Methods\\nDistance-based KGE methods model relations as\\naffine transformations from head entities to tail en-\\ntities. For example, TransE (Bordes et al., 2013)\\nmodels relations as translations, while RotatE (Sun\\net al., 2019) models relations as rotations in the\\ncomplex embedding space for better expressive-\\nness on symmetric relations. Recent work has\\ntried to model relations as scaling (Chao et al.,\\n2021) and reflection (Zhang et al., 2022) oper-\\nations in order to handle particular relation pat-\\nterns. Semantic-matching KGE methods, such as\\nRESCAL (Lin et al., 2015) and DistMult (Bor-\\ndes et al., 2014), formulate the scoring functions\\nas similarities among head, relation, and tail em-\\nbeddings. ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) ex-\\ntends such methods to a complex space for bet-\\nter expressiveness on asymmetric relations. Re-\\ncently, TuckER (Balazevic et al., 2019) and Au-\\ntoSF (Zhang et al., 2020) allow more flexibility\\nin modeling similarities.

In Euclidean space, Du-\\nalDE (Zhu et al., 2022) adopts Knowledge Distil-\\nlation to learn low-dimensional embeddings from\\nhigh-dimensional ones for smaller model sizes and\\nfaster inference time. Yet, it requires a long training\\ntime to reduce feature dimension. GreenKGC has\\ntwo clear advantages over existing low-dimensional\\nmethods. First, it fully operates in the Euclidean\\nspace. Second, it does not need to train new low-\\ndimensional embeddings from scratch, thus requir-\\ning a shorter dimension reduction time.\\n3\\nMethodology\\nGreenKGC is presented in this section. It con-\\nsists of three modules: representation learning,\\nfeature pruning, and decision learning, to obtain\\ndiscriminant low-dimensional triple features and\\npredict triple scores accurately. An overview of\\nGreenKGC is given in Fig. 2. Details of each mod-\\nule will be elaborated below.\\n3.1\\nRepresentation Learning\\nWe leverage existing KGE models, such as\\nTransE (Bordes et al., 2013) and RotatE (Sun et al.,\\n2019), to obtain good initial embeddings for enti-\\nties and relations, where their embedding dimen-\\nsions can be high to be expressive. Yet, the initial\\nembedding dimension will be largely reduced in\\nthe feature pruning module. In general, GreenKGC\\ncan build upon any existing KGE models. We re-\\nfer to the KGE models used in GreenKGC as our\\nbaseline models. We include the training details\\nfor baseline models in Appendix A as they are not\\nthe main focus of this paper.\\n3.2\\nFeature Pruning\\nIn this module, a small subset of feature dimensions\\nin high-dimensional KG representations from Mod-\\nule 1 are preserved, while the others are pruned, to\\nform low-dimensional discriminant KG features.\\nDiscriminant Feature Test (DFT). DFT is a\\nsupervised feature selection method recently pro-\\nposed in Yang et al. (2022). All training samples\\nhave a high-dimensional feature set as well as the\\ncorresponding labels. DFT scans through each di-\\nmension in the feature set and computes its dis-\\ncriminability based on sample labels. DFT can be\\nused to reduce the dimensions of entity and rela-\\ntion embeddings while preserving their power in\\ndownstream tasks such as KGC.\\nHere, we extend DFT to the multivariate setting\\nsince there are multiple variables in each triple. For\\nexample, TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) has 3 vari-\\nables (i.e. h, r, and t) in each feature dimension.\\nFirst, for each dimension i, we learn a linear trans-\\nformation wi to map multiple variables [hi, ri, ti]\\nto a single variable xi in each triple, where hi, ri, ti\\nrepresents the i-th dimension in the head, relation,\\nand tail representations, respectively. Such a linear\\ntransformation can be learned through principal\\ncomponent analysis (PCA) using singular value\\ndecomposition (SVD). As a result, wi is the first\\nprincipal component in PCA. However, linear trans-\\nformations learned from PCA are unsupervised and\\ncannot separate observed triples from negatives\\nwell. Alternatively, we learn the linear transforma-\\ntion through logistic regression by minimizing the\\nbinary cross-entropy loss\\nL = \\u2212y log(\\u03c3(wi[hi, ri, ti]T ))\\n\\u2212(1 \\u2212y) log(1 \\u2212\\u03c3(wi[hi, ri, ti]T )),\\n(1)\\nwhere y = 1 for observed triples (h, r, t) and\\ny = 0 for corrupted triples (h\\u2032, r, t\\u2032). Afterward,\\nwe can apply the standard DFT to each dimension.\\nDFT adopts cross-entropy (CE) to evaluate the\\ndiscriminant power of each dimension as CE is\\na typical loss for binary classification. Dimen-\\nsions with lower CE imply higher discriminant\\n10598\\n\",\"page_number\":3}\n{\"page_content\":\"[0, 1] soft labels\\nBinary \\nclassifier\\nLow-dimensional\\ntriple features\\nFeature pruning\\n[0, 1] soft labels\\nFeature pruning\\n[0, 1] soft labels\\nFeature pruning\\nHigh-dimensional\\nentity \\/ relation \\nrepresentations\\nKG partitioning\\nBinary \\nclassifier\\nBinary \\nclassifier\\n(a)\\n(b)\\n(c)\\nFigure 2: An overview of GreenKGC, which consists of three modules: (a) representation learning, (b) feature\\npruning, and (c) decision learning.\\nCluster #\\nRelations\\n0\\n_derivationally_related_form\\n_also_see\\n_member_meronym\\n_has_part\\n_verb_group\\n_similar_to\\n1\\n_hypernym\\n_instance_hypernym\\n_synset_domain_topic_of\\n2\\n_member_of_domain_usage\\n_member_of_domain_region\\nTable 1: Relation grouping results on WN18RR when\\napplying k-Means on relation embeddings when k = 3.\\npower.

Then, we perform feature pruning\\nwithin each relation group and select the powerful\\nfeature dimensions correspondingly.\\nWe hypothesize that relations that have similar\\nproperties are close in the embedding space. There-\\nfore, we use k-Means to cluster relation embed-\\nFigure 3: Average cross-entropy for different numbers\\nof KG partitions in FB15k-237.\\ndings into relation groups. To verify our hypothe-\\nsize, we show the grouping results on WN18RR in\\nTable 1. Without categorizing relations into differ-\\nent logical patterns explicitly, relations of similar\\npatterns can be clustered together in the embedding\\nspace. For example, most relations in cluster #0\\nare symmetric ones. All relations in the cluster #1\\nare N-to-1.
