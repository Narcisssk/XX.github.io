{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, efficiently serving LLMs has been a challenge due to its large memory bottleneck, specifically in small batch inference settings (e.g. mobile devices). Weight-only quantization can be a promising approach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude activation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first propose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates quantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional per-output channel (OC). Our method is motivated by the observation that activation outliers affect the input dimension of the weight matrix, so similarly grouping the weights in the IC direction can $\\\\textit{isolate outliers to be within a group}$. We also find that activation outliers do not dictate quantization difficulty, and inherent weight sensitivities also exist. With per-IC quantization as a new outlier-friendly scheme, we then propose Adaptive Dimensions ($\\\\textbf{AdaDim}$), a versatile quantization framework that can adapt to various weight sensitivity patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaDim by augmenting prior methods such as Round-To-Nearest and GPTQ, showing significant improvements across various language modeling benchmarks for both base (up to $+4.7\\\\%$ on MMLU) and instruction-tuned (up to $+10\\\\%$ on HumanEval) LLMs.\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"0bbd7a9a-8b7f-597a-9702-ee5dedd5255d\",\"title\":\"SemCoder: Training Code Language Models with Comprehensive Semantics Reasoning\",\"abstract\":\"Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have excelled at tasks like code completion but often miss deeper semantics such as execution effects and dynamic states. This paper aims to bridge the gap between Code LLMs' reliance on static text data and the need for semantic understanding for complex tasks like debugging and program repair. We introduce a novel strategy, _monologue reasoning_, to train Code LLMs to reason comprehensive semantics, encompassing high-level functional descriptions, local execution effects of individual statements, and overall input\\/output behavior, thereby linking static code text with dynamic execution states.\\nWe begin by collecting PyX, a clean Python corpus of fully executable code samples with functional descriptions and test cases. \\nWe propose training Code LLMs not only to write code but also to understand code semantics by reasoning about key properties, constraints, and execution behaviors using natural language, mimicking human verbal debugging, i.e., rubber-duck debugging. This approach led to the development of SemCoder, a Code LLM with only 6.7B parameters, which shows competitive performance with GPT-3.5-turbo on code generation and execution reasoning tasks. SemCoder achieves 79.3% on HumanEval (GPT-3.5-turbo: 76.8%), 63.6% on CRUXEval-I (GPT-3.5-turbo: 50.3%), and 63.9% on CRUXEval-O (GPT-3.5-turbo: 59.0%). We also study the effectiveness of SemCoder's monologue-style execution reasoning compared to concrete scratchpad reasoning, showing that our approach integrates semantics from multiple dimensions more smoothly. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of applying learned semantics to improve Code LLMs' debugging and self-refining capabilities.

Recent work utilizes plan-and-solve decomposition to decrease the complexity and leverage self-tests to refine the generated program. Yet, planning deep-inside requirements in advance can be challenging, and the tests need to be accurate to accomplish self-improvement. To this end, we propose FunCoder, a code generation framework incorporating the divide-and-conquer strategy with functional consensus. Specifically, FunCoder recursively branches off sub-functions as smaller goals during code generation, represented by a tree hierarchy. These sub-functions are then composited to attain more complex objectives. Additionally, we designate functions via a consensus formed by identifying similarities in program behavior, mitigating error propagation. FunCoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +9.8% on average in HumanEval, MBPP, xCodeEval and MATH with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, our method demonstrates superiority on smaller models: With FunCoder, StableCode-3b surpasses GPT-3.5 by +18.6% and achieves 97.7% of GPT-4's performance on HumanEval. Further analysis reveals that our proposed dynamic function decomposition is capable of handling complex requirements, and the functional consensus prevails over self-testing in correctness evaluation.\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"189ab94c-8288-5ea5-9013-b6df4ddd269d\",\"title\":\"Instruction Tuning With Loss Over Instructions\",\"abstract\":\"Instruction tuning plays a crucial role in shaping the outputs of language models (LMs) to desired styles. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method, Instruction Modelling (IM), which trains LMs by applying a loss function to the instruction and prompt part rather than solely to the output part. Through experiments across 21 diverse benchmarks, we show that, in many scenarios, IM can effectively improve the LM performance on both NLP tasks (*e.g.,* MMLU, TruthfulQA, and HumanEval) and open-ended generation benchmarks (*e.g.,* MT-Bench and AlpacaEval). Remarkably, in the most advantageous case, IM boosts model performance on AlpacaEval 1.0 by over 100%. We identify two key factors influencing the effectiveness of IM: (1) The ratio between instruction length and output length in the training data; and (2) The number of training examples. We observe that IM is especially beneficial when trained on datasets with lengthy instructions paired with brief outputs, or under the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis (SAH) where a small amount of training examples are used for instruction tuning. Further analysis substantiates our hypothesis that our improvement can be attributed to reduced overfitting to instruction tuning datasets. It is worth noting that we are not proposing \\\\ours as a replacement for the current instruction tuning process.\\nInstead, our work aims to provide practical guidance for instruction tuning LMs, especially in low-resource scenarios.\\nOur code is available at https:\\/\\/github.com\\/ZhengxiangShi\\/InstructionModelling.\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"3282322d-ff2e-5269-8e96-e7906a98cfac\",\"title\":\"CodeChain: Towards Modular Code Generation Through Chain of Self-revisions with Representative Sub-modules\",\"abstract\":\"Large Language Models (LLMs) have already become quite proficient at solving simpler programming tasks like those in HumanEval or MBPP benchmarks. However, solving more complex and competitive programming tasks is still quite challenging for these models - possibly due to their tendency to generate solutions as monolithic code blocks instead of decomposing them into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. On the other hand, experienced programmers instinctively write modularized code with abstraction for solving complex tasks, often reusing previously developed modules. To address this gap, we propose CodeChain, a novel framework for inference that elicits modularized code generation through a chain of self-revisions, each being guided by some representative sub-modules generated in previous iterations. Concretely, CodeChain first instructs the LLM to generate modularized codes through chain-of-thought prompting. Then it applies a chain of self-revisions by iterating the two steps: 1) extracting and clustering the generated sub-modules and selecting the cluster representatives as the more generic and re-usable implementations, and 2) augmenting the original chain-of-thought prompt with these selected module-implementations and instructing the LLM to re-generate new modularized solutions. We find that by naturally encouraging the LLM to reuse the previously developed and verified sub-modules, CodeChain can significantly boost both modularity as well as correctness of the generated solutions, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 35\\\\% on APPS and 76\\\\% on CodeContests. It is shown to be effective on both OpenAI LLMs as well as open-sourced LLMs like WizardCoder. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies with different methods of prompting, number of clusters, model sizes, program qualities, etc., to provide useful insights that underpin CodeChain's success.\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"33b2bb79-7d68-5315-96c6-e63dab5303d6\",\"title\":\"Large Language Model Evaluation Via Multi AI Agents: Preliminary results\",\"abstract\":\"The increasing significance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both the academic and industrial sectors can be attributed to their exceptional performance across a diverse range of applications. As LLMs have become integral to both research and daily operations, rigorous evaluation is crucial. This assessment is important not only for individual tasks but also for understanding their societal\\nimpact and potential risks. Despite extensive efforts to examine LLMs from various perspectives, there is a noticeable lack of multi-agent AI models specifically designed to evaluate the performance of different LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-agent AI model that aims to assess and compare the performance of various LLMs. Our model consists of eight distinct AI agents, each responsible for retrieving code based on a common description from different advanced language models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Google Bard, LLAMA, and Hugging Face. Our developed model utilizes the API of each language model to retrieve code for a given high-level description. Additionally, we developed a verification agent, tasked with the critical role of evaluating the code generated by its counterparts. We integrate the HumanEval benchmark into our verification agent to assess the generated code\\u2019s performance, providing insights into their respective capabilities and efficiencies. Our initial results indicate that the GPT-3.5 Turbo model\\u2019s performance is comparatively better than the other models. Initially, we provided ten common high-level input descriptions to our proposed model. This preliminary analysis serves as a benchmark, comparing their performances side by side. Our future goal is to enhance the evaluation process by incorporating the Massively Multitask Benchmark for Python (MBPP) benchmark, which is expected to further refine our assessment. Additionally, we plan to share our developed model with twenty practitioners from various backgrounds to test our model and collect their feedback for further improvement.\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"37758401-6101-554f-8f1e-4e2995443314\",\"title\":\"Large Language Models Meet NL2Code: A Survey\",\"abstract\":\"The task of generating code from a natural language description, or NL2Code, is considered a pressing and significant challenge in code intelligence.

Second, we evaluate twenty code models on our benchmark and discover that many recent high-scoring models on HumanEval show no improvements on our benchmark. Third, we show that simple CoT and fine-tuning schemes can improve performance on our benchmark but remain far from solving it. The best setup, GPT-4 with chain of thought (CoT), achieves a pass@1 of 75% and 81% on input and output prediction, respectively. In contrast, Code Llama 34B achieves a pass@1 of 50% and 46% on input and output prediction.

We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM out- puts, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural lan- guage. Based on this insight, we propose PlanSearch, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PlanSearch generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and uses these observations to con- struct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PlanSearch explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PlanSearch on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best pass-rate achieved without any search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling on top of existing non-search models (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict perfor- mance gains from search as a function of the diversity over generated ideas.

Discrete Flow Matching offers several key contributions:  (i) it works with a general family of probability paths interpolating between source and target distributions; (ii) it allows for a generic formula for sampling from these probability paths using learned posteriors such as the probability denoiser ($x$-prediction) and noise-prediction ($\\\\epsilon$-prediction); (iii) practically, focusing on specific probability paths defined with different schedulers improves generative perplexity compared to previous discrete diffusion and flow models; and (iv) by scaling Discrete Flow Matching models up to 1.7B parameters, we reach 6.7% Pass@1 and 13.4% Pass@10 on HumanEval and 6.7% Pass@1 and 20.6% Pass@10 on 1-shot MBPP coding benchmarks.

Only when oracle\\nfeedback is available to assist with early termination does the self-refine approach provide a slight\\n16\\nApproach\\nGSM8K [11]\\nMATH [20]\\nw\\/o oracle\\nw\\/ oracle\\nw\\/o oracle\\nw\\/ oracle\\nm1@t1\\n\\u2192m5@t1\\n\\u2192m1@t5\\np1@t5\\nm1@t1\\n\\u2192m5@t1\\n\\u2192m1@t5\\np1@t5\\nRISE (Ours)\\nLlama2 Base\\n10.5\\n22.8 (+12.3)\\n11.1 (+0.6)\\n13.9 (+3.4)\\n1.9\\n5.1 (+3.2)\\n1.4 (-0.5)\\n2.3 (+0.4)\\n+Boost\\n32.9\\n45.4 (+12.5)\\n39.2 (+6.3)\\n55.5 (+22.6)\\n5.5\\n6.8 (+1.3)\\n5.5 (+0.0)\\n14.6 (+9.1)\\n+Iteration 1\\n35.6\\n49.7 (+14.1)\\n50.7 (+15.1)\\n63.9 (+28.3)\\n6.3\\n8.8 (+2.5)\\n9.7 (+3.4)\\n19.4 (+13.1)\\n+Iteration 2\\n37.3\\n51.0 (+13.7)\\n55.0 (+17.7)\\n68.4 (+31.1)\\n5.8\\n10.4 (+4.6)\\n10.4 (+4.6)\\n19.8 (+14.0)\\nRISE (Ours)\\nMistral-7B\\n33.7\\n49.4 (+15.7)\\n39.0 (+5.3)\\n46.9 (+13.2)\\n7.5\\n13.0 (+5.5)\\n8.4 (+0.9)\\n13.0 (+5.5)\\n+ Iteration 1\\n35.3\\n50.6 (+15.3)\\n59.2 (+23.9)\\n68.6 (+33.3)\\n6.7\\n9.5 (+2.8)\\n18.4 (+11.1)\\n29.7 (+22.4)\\nSFT on oracle data\\nOnly correct data\\n27.4\\n42.2 (+14.9)\\n34.0 (+6.6)\\n43.6 (+16.2)\\n5.8\\n7.9 (+2.1)\\n5.5 (-0.3)\\n12.1 (+6.2)\\nCorrect and incorrect\\n25.7\\n41.8 (+16.1)\\n31.2 (+5.5)\\n41.5 (+15.8)\\n5.0\\n5.2 (+0.2)\\n5.0 (+0.0)\\n13.1 (+8.1)\\nBaselines\\nGPT-3.5\\n66.4\\n80.6 (+14.2)\\n71.0 (+4.6)\\n74.7 (+8.3)\\n39.7\\n47.8 (+8.1)\\n45.1 (+5.4)\\n54.3 (+14.6)\\nMistral-7B\\n33.7\\n49.4 (+15.7)\\n39.0 (+5.3)\\n46.9 (+13.2)\\n7.5\\n13.0 (+5.5)\\n8.4 (+0.9)\\n13.0 (+5.5)\\nEurus-7b-SFT\\n36.3\\n66.3 (+30.0)\\n47.9 (+11.6)\\n53.1 (+16.8)\\n12.3\\n19.8 (+7.5)\\n16.3 (+4.0)\\n22.9 (+10.6)\\nSelf-Refine\\n\\u2192m1@t3\\n\\u2192p1@t3\\n\\u2192m1@t3\\n\\u2192p1@t3\\nBase\\n10.5\\n22.4 (+11.9)\\n7.1 (-3.4)\\n13.0 (+2.5)\\n1.9\\n5.1 (+3.2)\\n1.9 (0.0)\\n3.1 (+1.2)\\n+Boost\\n32.9\\n45.3 (+12.4)\\n26.5 (-6.4)\\n40.9 (+8.0)\\n5.5\\n6.5 (+1.0)\\n2.9 (-2.6)\\n7.2 (+1.7)\\n+Iteration1\\n35.6\\n49.5 (+13.9)\\n31.7 (-3.9)\\n43.7 (+8.1)\\n6.3\\n8.7 (+2.4)\\n5.9 (-0.4)\\n9.9 (+3.6)\\n+Iteration2\\n37.3\\n50.5 (+13.2)\\n33.3 (-4.0)\\n44.5 (+7.2)\\n5.8\\n9.4 (+3.6)\\n5.7 (-0.1)\\n9.5 (+3.7)\\nGPT-3.5\\n66.4\\n80.2 (+13.8)\\n61.0 (-5.4)\\n71.6 (+5.2)\\n39.7\\n46.5 (+6.8)\\n36.5 (-3.2)\\n46.7 (+7.0)\\nMistral-7B\\n33.7\\n48.5 (+14.8)\\n21.2 (-12.5)\\n37.9 (+4.2)\\n7.5\\n12.3 (+4.8)\\n7.1 (-0.4)\\n11.4 (+3.9)\\nEurus-7b-SFT\\n36.3\\n65.9 (+29.6)\\n26.2 (-10.1)\\n42.8 (+6.5)\\n12.3\\n19.4 (+7.1)\\n9.0 (-3.3)\\n15.1 (+2.8)\\nGloRE\\n\\u2192m1@t3\\n\\u2192p1@t3\\n+ORM\\n48.2\\n49.5 (+1.3)\\n57.1 (+8.9)\\n+SORM\\n48.2\\n51.6 (+3.4)\\n59.7 (+11.5)\\nN\\/A\\n+Direct\\n48.2\\n47.4 (-0.8)\\n59.2 (+11.0)\\nV-STaR\\n\\u2192m64@t1\\n+STaR\\n28.0\\n46.1 (+18.1)\\n+Verification\\n28.0\\n56.2 (+28.2)\\nN\\/A\\n+V-STaR\\n28.0\\n63.2 (+35.2)\\nTable 3: Comparing RISE with other approaches (Self-Refine, GLoRE, and V-STaR) and other baseline\\napproaches. Observe that RISE attains the biggest performance improvements between 1-turn and 5-turn\\nperformance without the use of an oracle on both GSM8K and MATH. This performance gap is even larger\\nwhen oracle early termination is allowed (5-turn w\\/ oracle). Self-Refine largely degrades performance across the\\nboard. GLoRE trains a separate refinement model, but still performs worse than RISE.\\nperformance boost. This highlights the limitation of the self-refine structure in effectively improving\\nmodel performance without external guidance, which is also observed in [24].\\nIn contrast, the model trained with RISE can attain consistent performance improvements without\\nrelying on an oracle. By training the model to iteratively refine its responses, our method enables\\nthe model to self-correct and improve its performance over multiple turns. This showcases the\\neffectiveness of our approach in comparison to the self-refine baseline, as it allows for more robust\\nand consistent performance gains without the need for the oracle assistance.\\nComparison with GLoRE [19]. GLoRE is a multi-model system that relies on a student model\\nto propose drafts, an Outcome-based Reward Model (ORM) or Step-wise ORM to locate errors\\nat different granularity levels, and a Global or Local Refinement Model for adjusting these errors.\\nSince no code was openly available for this approach, in our experiments, we compared to the\\nnumbers from the main paper Havrilla et al. [19]. While the comparison against GLoRE is already\\napples-to-oranges since our method only trains a single end-to-end model, while GLoRE trains\\nmultiple models. Performance-wise, GLoRE\\u2019s global and local refinement models show little to no\\nimprovement in overall accuracy without an oracle, and even exhibit decreasing accuracy in some\\ncases. However, when an oracle is used to guide the refinement process, GLoRE demonstrates a 10%\\nimprovement on the 7B model in the GSM8K dataset.\\nAs anticipated, since we run RISE from a less advanced base model (Llama2 7B), we observe a slightly\\nlower absolute performance compared to GLoRE. However, RISE demonstrates its effectiveness\\nin self-improvement by sequentially enhancing its performance by an impressive 13.4% within\\njust 3 turns without an oracle feedback, and by a remarkable 23.4% with an oracle on GSM8K.\\nThis showcase of RISE\\u2019s capabilities is particularly noteworthy considering that GLoRE utilizes 3\\n17\\nSelf-Refine\\nSystem: You are an AI language model designed to assist with math problem-solving.

V-STaR requires training an additional verifier model to rank\\ncandidate answers generated by the targeted model, but it does not make any sequential revisions\\nor improvements to a response. While comparing RISE to using a verifier for re-ranking the top 5\\nresponses at the first turn (as a base comparison) would have been informative, we were unable to\\nfind this specific result in the original V-STaR paper. The results presented in the official table 3\\nfor V-STaR correspond to running 64 samples, which improves the base model\\u2019s performance by\\n35.2% for each prompt during evaluation. In contrast, our method, RISE, after the same amount of\\nfinetuning iterations (3 iterations) and using only 5 samples, improves upon the base model by 44.5%\\n(calculated as 55.0% - 10.5% = 44.5%). This comparison highlights RISE\\u2019s efficiency in achieving\\nsignificant improvements with fewer samples and iterations compared to V-STaR\\u2019s approach of using\\na large number of samples without sequential refinement.\\nMoreover, V-STaR\\u2019s performance is inherently bounded by the candidate generator\\u2019s performance.\\nAs discussed in Section 5, if there is no correct response among the generated candidates, the problem\\nremains unsolved. In contrast, we show in Figure 5 that RISE can also solve problems that were not\\nsolved by majority voting with a much higher budget in the first turn. Furthermore, we believe that\\ncombining V-STaR with RISE could lead to even better performance, as RISE can generate better\\nmodels and a verifier can be complementarily used for filtering.\\nComparison with other base models. Mistral-7B [25] and Eurus-7B-SFT [63] are models that\\nexhibit comparable performance to our method in terms of the absolute maj@5 performance. However,\\nit is crucial to note that these base models are fine-tuned using a vast amount of data, including data\\nspecifically tuned for math reasoning performance [63], while our model is fine-tuned on a single\\ndomain. That said, we do show that fine-tuning with RISE can still enhance the performance of\\nMistral-7B models.\\nTo summarize, our method offers advantages over GLoRE and V-STaR: end-to-end error correction\\nwith a single model, superior performance with fewer samples, and solving problems unsolvable by\\nfirst-turn random sampling. Although our maj@1 performance is lower than GLoRE\\u2019s base model\\nEI, our 5-turn performance surpasses their best performance in both oracle and non-oracle scenarios.\\nCompared to Mistral-7B and Eurus-7B-SFT, our method achieves comparable performance while\\nbeing fine-tuned on a single domain, and generalizes to better base models.\\nB.2\\nThe Performance of RISE over More Turns than Training\\nIn this section, we evaluate RISE\\u2019s performance on GSM8K across multiple turns (up to k=10). Our\\nanalysis reveals several key findings. First, the base model demonstrates limited self-improvement\\ncapability: as we increase the number of turns k, the performance improvement is marginal, showing\\nonly a 0.7% increase (from 10.5% to 11.2%) at k = 10. Notably, this multi-turn performance is\\ninferior to the strategy of sampling 10 responses in the first turn, which yields a more substantial\\n18\\nimprovement of 17.3% (from 10.5% to 27.8%). This pattern consistently holds across all values of\\nk from 1 to 10. In contrast, RISE demonstrates significant improvements in two aspects. First, it\\nsubstantially enhances the model\\u2019s base performance, elevating it from 10.5% to 35.5% after one\\niteration, and further to 37.3% after two iterations. More importantly, RISE enables more effective\\nsequential self-improvement: at k = 10, the model achieves a remarkable performance gain of 22.2%\\n(from 35.6% to 57.8%) after one iteration, and 23.0% (from 37.3% to 60.3%) after two iterations. This\\nenhanced self-improvment capability is evident across most values of k, where m1@tk consistently\\nsurpasses mk@t1.\\nTurn\\nBase\\nRISE (Iteration 1)\\nRISE (Iteration 2)\\nmk@t1\\nm1@tk\\np1@tk\\nmk@t1\\nm1@tk\\np1@tk\\nmk@t1\\nm1@tk\\np1@tk\\n1\\n10.5\\n35.6\\n37.3\\n2\\n15.2\\n11.0\\n13.0\\n39.9\\n41.4\\n51.9\\n40.6\\n42.0\\n52.8\\n3\\n19.2\\n12.0\\n13.6\\n44.5\\n46.6\\n58.4\\n46.5\\n49.4\\n60.0\\n4\\n21.7\\n11.9\\n13.8\\n48.0\\n49.4\\n62.5\\n49.6\\n53.4\\n64.4\\n5\\n22.8\\n11.1\\n13.9\\n49.7\\n50.7\\n63.9\\n51.0\\n55.0\\n68.4\\n6\\n24.9\\n11.7\\n14.1\\n50.9\\n53.1\\n68.8\\n54.1\\n55.5\\n69.4\\n7\\n26.2\\n11.4\\n14.3\\n55.2\\n55.1\\n70.9\\n55.7\\n57.0\\n71.6\\n8\\n27.4\\n11.3\\n14.3\\n56.3\\n55.9\\n72.9\\n56.0\\n58.1\\n72.9\\n9\\n27,5\\n11.3\\n14.4\\n56.6\\n56.3\\n74.2\\n56.9\\n59.3\\n74.2\\n10\\n27.8\\n11.2\\n14.6\\n57.6\\n57.8\\n75.4\\n57.2\\n60.3\\n75.3\\nTable 4: The performance of RISE with Llama-2-7B over 10 turns on GSM8K.

We also find\\nsequential sampling with RISE (m1@tk) still outperforms parallel sampling (mk@t1), with a larger gap between\\nthese numbers from iteration 1 to 2 of RISE, although parallel sampling for the base model is much better than\\nsequential sampling. This means RISE is effective at teaching the model how to improve itself.\\nB.3\\nThe Performance of RISE on Code Generation Tasks\\nIn Table 5, we evaluate RISE\\u2019s effectiveness when integrated with Llama-2-7B on two established\\nPython programming benchmarks: MBPP [2] and CoNaLa [61]. Our experimental results demon-\\nstrate that after a single iteration, RISE significantly enhances the model\\u2019s five-turn performance,\\nyielding improvements of 7.0% and 1.7% on MBPP and CoNaLa, respectively. Notably, these multi-\\nturn performance gains are achieved while simultaneously improving the first-turn performance: RISE\\nelevates the initial success rate from 19.0% to 27.0% on MBPP and from 5.3% to 6.1% on CoNaLa,\\nindicating that the method enhances both immediate and iterative problem-solving capabilities.\\nApproach\\nMBPP\\nCoNaLa\\nw\\/o oracle\\nw\\/ oracle\\nw\\/o oracle\\nw\\/ oracle\\nm1@t1\\n\\u2192m5@t1\\n\\u2192m1@t5\\np1@t5\\nm1@t1\\n\\u2192m5@t1\\n\\u2192m1@t5\\np1@t5\\nLlama2 Base\\n19.0\\n29.0 (+10.0)\\n15.0 (-4.0)\\n22.0 (+3.0)\\n5.3\\n6.8 (+1.5)\\n5.8 (+0.5)\\n8.4 (+3.1)\\n+Iteration 1\\n27.0\\n32.0 (+5.0)\\n34.0 (+7.0)\\n48.0 (+21.0)\\n6.1\\n7.0 (+0.9)\\n7.8 (+1.7)\\n13.6 (+7.5)\\nTable 5: The performance of RISE on MBPP [2] and CoNaLa [61].
