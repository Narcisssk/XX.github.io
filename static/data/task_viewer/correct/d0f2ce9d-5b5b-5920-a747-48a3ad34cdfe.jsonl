{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "[Question]: I believe introducing synthetic text-to-SQL data into model fine-tuning will benefit the final accuracy of the text-to-SQL task.

In recent studies (Gao et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023), notable accomplishments have been observed in powerful closed-source LLMs, exemplifed by GPT4, employing a range of prompting methods (Wei et al., 2022). However, the adoption of closedsource LLMs introduces concerns pertaining to issues of openness, privacy, and substantial costs.\\nRecently, the proliferation of numerous opensource LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023; Roziere et al.,\\n2023; Bai et al., 2023) has attracted considerable attention as these models demonstrate comparable capabilities to their closed-source counterparts across a broad spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This motivates us to undertake a thorough evaluation of prominent open-source LLMs in the text-to-SQL task, aiming to gauge their viability as alternatives. However, following an assessment utilizing a standardized prompt, we observed that open-source models still exhibit a substantial performance gap compared to closed-source models. In particular, the popular open-source model CodeLLaMA-13B-Instruct demonstrates a $30\\\\%$ lower execution accuracy than GPT-4 on the BIRD (Li et al., 2023c) benchmark.\\nDeveloping specialized text-to-SQL models built upon open-source LLMs that attains performance levels comparable to close-source models holds critical importance in contexts marked by sensitivity to policy, privacy, and resource limitations. To this end, we focus on supervised fne-tuning (SFT) to enhance the text-to-SQL capabilities of open-source base models. However, enhancing the text-to-SQL ability of open-source models through SFT remains an open challenge. A signifcant barrier to this progress is the high cost of achieving text-to-SQL data, which relies on manual expert annotation. The generation of high-quality text-toSQL fne-tuning data should consider two primary perspectives. First, the inclusion of diverse data aims to facilitate cross-domain generalization, allowing the model to be successfully applied to new domains or databases. Second, alignment with executors becomes crucial to better enable the model to learn SQL from execution feedback, particularly from errors, mirroring how humans often learn from their mistakes.\\n\\nIn response to the data scarcity challenge, numerous endeavors (Wang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023) have sought to generate synthetic data utilizing larger and more powerful LLMs (strong models), such as GPT-4, creating what is denoted as strong data. Although strong data inherently contributes to the enhancement of data diversity (Xu et al., 2024), a critical factor for the domain generalization of models, its application in the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. Additionally, the generation of valuable erroneous text-to-SQL data poses a separate challenge. Strong models often exhibit signifcant efforts toward correct alignment and safety, making it diffcult to elicit erroneous samples. Consequently, we redirect our focus towards smaller, less well-aligned open-source models (weak models). Weak models produce valuable weak SQL samples, which can subsequently be validated and subjected to error induction with the assistance of executors. Preference learning (Rafailov et al., 2023) is employed to instruct language models to learn from both correct and incorrect samples, constituting what we refer to as weak data.\\nTo verify the effectiveness of our SENSE, we conduct SFT on a popular open-source base model, i.e., CodeLLaMA (Roziere et al., 2023), and obtain a new specialized model named SENSE. We comprehensively evaluate SENSE\\u2019s performance on the text-to-SQL tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on both the standard benchmark Spider (Yu et al., 2018) and the challenging benchmark BIRD (Li et al., 2023c), narrowing the gap between open-source and closed-source models. Additionally, we evaluate SENSE on three robustness datasets: SYN (Gan et al., 2021a), REALISTIC (Deng et al., 2021), and DK (Gan et al., 2021b), demonstrating its advantages in robustness. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth experimental analysis offers insights into the infuence of synthetic data on model performance. In summary, our contributions are threefold:\\n\\n\\u2022 We frst evaluate both open-source and closedsource LLMs on text-to-SQL benchmarks using a standardized prompt. We observe that the text-to-SQL capabilities of open-source models were signifcantly inferior. It motivated us to train our specialized model SENSE through SFT on an open-source LLM. \\u2022 We propose a synthetic data approach that uses strong models to generate strong data to enhance data diversity and employs weak models to generate weak data combined with an executor to learn from feedback. \\u2022 Extensive experiments shows the effectiveness of SENSE, achieving SOTA performance, even competing with methods based on GPT4. We believe that making these data and models publicly available can contribute to the advancement of the text-to-SQL community.\"}\n{\"abstract\":\"The capability gap between open-source and closed-source large language models (LLMs) remains a challenge in text-to-SQL tasks.

To mitigate this and further expand the scale, we turn to the powerful language model GPT-4 for assistance, utilizing prompts to synthesize target data. Given that crossdomain generalization is a central challenge for text-to-SQL, we designed hints to encourage diversity by prompting GPT-4 to generate suffciently diverse datasets, as shown in Figure 3.
