{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Tables are widely used to store and present data across various felds, e.g., fnancial analysis, scientifc research and government reports (Lautert et al., 2013; Shigarov, 2023). To make the most of the abundant tabular data, the table understanding (TU) technique has been proposed to automatically understand tables and perform table-based tasks, such as question answering (Pasupat and Liang,\\n2015) and text generation (Parikh et al., 2020). As a technique that could signifcantly elevate work effciency in different industries, it has attracted ever-increasing research interest in recent years.\\nThough considerable efforts have been dedicated to the table understanding problem (Herzig et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022), most previous models can only fulfll very limited tasks until the emergence of large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022). With the help of powerful LLMs, we are getting closer to the vision that a versatile model can perform a variety of table-based tasks. However, existing table-oriented LLMs (Zhang et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023c; Zha et al., 2023) rely heavily on the prerequisite that all given tables must be converted into a certain text sequence (like Markdown or HTML) to be input to LLMs. Under some practical scenarios like scanned documents and webpage screenshots, it is diffcult to obtain such high-quality textual table representations, and yet table images are more accessible. Moreover, humans can directly understand two-dimensional tables using the intuitive visual information, whereas LLMs can only interpret tables in a one-directional textual perspective, which may increase the diffculty of comprehending diverse table structures and colored table elements. In summary, for the sake of convenience and intuitiveness, it is a crucial and urgent challenge to explore how to directly digest tables using visual information.\\n\\nTo promote the advancement of table understanding and its real-world applications, we propose the multimodal table understanding problem, where the model is required to generate correct responses to different table-related requests (e.g., questions) in an end-to-end fashion based on the table image. Despite the fact that recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in many multimodal tasks, they cannot be directly extended to the proposed task. As shown in Figure 1, the performance of popular MLLMs like MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) and BLIP2 (Li et al., 2023b) is close to zero on most tasks, revealing their weakness in understanding tabular data. More importantly, there is a lack of a comprehensive dataset that can support both the development and evaluation of generalist MLLMs towards multimodal table understanding.\\nTo address the above issue, we construct MMTab, the frst open-source large-scale dataset for multimodal table understanding problem, based on 14 publicly available table datasets of 8 domains. We carefully design scripts to convert original textual tables in these datasets into table images highlighting a broad coverage of table structures and styles, and transform all task-specifc samples into multimodal instruction-tuning samples with a unifed format of <table image, input request, output response>. The resulting dataset contains (1) 150K table recognition samples on 97K table images for pre-training (named MMTab-pre). (2) 232K samples of 14 table-based tasks on 82K table images for instruction tuning (named MMTabinstruct). (3) 49K test samples on 23K table images composing 17 held-in and 7 held-out benchmarks (named MMTab-eval). During the dataset construction, data augmentations at multiple levels (e.g., table-level, task-level) were adopted to further improve the data diversity, and we also introduce multimodal table structure understanding tasks that have been overlooked in previous studies.\\n\\nBased on the curated dataset, we develop a versatile tabular MLLM named Table-LLaVA with an enhanced two-stage training paradigm. In the frst stage, we pre-train LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2023a) with an extra table recognition task on the MMTabpre, which requires the model to generate textual sequences (like HTML) given table images. This stage aligns the structures and elements within table images to textual modality and thus enhances the comprehension of the basic table structure and content. In the second stage, we continue to instructiontuning the model with diverse table-based downstream tasks on the MMTab-instruct, which endows the model with the multimodal instructionfollowing ability for table-related requests.\\nWe compare Table-LLaVA with a series of opensource (M)LLMs and closed-source GPT-4V. Experimental results show that Table-LLaVA beats strong MLLM baselines on 17 held-in and 6 heldout benchmarks, and is even competitive with the powerful GPT-4V on 14 benchmarks with a subset of test samples. Extensive ablation experiments are conducted to reveal the contributions of different training data (e.g., the infuence of table recognition pre-training data). We also explore the mutual infuence between model\\u2019s capacity for tabular tasks and non-tabular tasks. We hope this work could establish a strong base for future research on the multimodal table understanding problem and facilitate the progress of more general MLLMs.\\nWe conclude our contributions as follows:\\n1) We make the frst systematic exploration of the multimodal table understanding problem, which is complementary to the traditional text-only problem setting.\\n2) Accordingly, we construct and release a largescale dataset MM-Tab which covers diverse tables and data for different tasks, including a series of novel table structure understanding tasks.\\n3) We develop a versatile tabular MLLM TableLLaVA, which signifcantly outperforms a range of strong MLLM baselines under both held-in and held-out settings (Figure 1).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Previous works have shown that the diversity of instruction-following data is crucial to the capability of the resulting instruction-following models (Zhou et al., 2023; Si et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c). To create more data diversity and avoid over-ftting in the model training, we perform additional data augmentations at multiple levels.\\n\\nTable-level augmentations. Real-world tables often have varied structures and styles. An ideal table understanding model should be able to process divergent tables like a human reader. Since our dataset already includes diverse table structures from academic datasets, we separately design scripts to render table images with three different styles: Web-page $(70.8\\\\%)$ , Excel $(19.4\\\\%)$ and Markdown $(9.8\\\\%)$ . Fine-grained adjustments such as font type and cell colors are also considered.\\nInstruction-level augmentations. In practical scenarios, user instructions for the same task are likely to vary from user to user. To improve models\\u2019 robustness towards such variations, we resort to GPT-4 to generate new instruction templates and descriptions about JSON output format in a fewshot fashion based on several manually annotated demonstrations. Generated instruction templates with grammar mistakes or deviation from the original task are fltered out. When we construct input requests of each dataset, we randomly select an instruction template and an output format description from the candidate pool, and then combine them with the task-specifc input such as table-related questions to produce the fnal input request. This combination strategy can bring more diversity of input requests. Using the TABMWP as an example, we show instruction templates and Python code for building input requests in Figure 8.\\n\\nTask-level augmentations. Though the collected 14 public datasets highlight 9 academic tabular tasks (e.g., Flat TQA and Cell Description) which demand table-based reasoning capabilities, it is still a question whether existing MLLMs are truly aware of the basic table structures. Prior study has found that, despite achieving great performance on downstream tasks, tabular LLMs may still exhibit poor capacity for perceiving table structures (Sui et al., 2023). To further strengthen the fundamental table structure understanding ability of MLLMs, 6 table structure understanding tasks (the 6 rows with \\u2018Structure Understanding\\u2019 task category in Table 1) are devised, e.g., table size detection (TSD) task.\\nFor each task, we use the above-mentioned method to generate input requests and design scripts to automatically extract the fnal answer from the textual tables in collected datasets. Finally, 8K training samples, 1K or 1.25K evaluation samples were constructed for each structure understanding task. Except above strategies, we also combine singleturn samples of the same table to compose 37K multi-turn conversation samples. At last, we obtain 232K samples on 82K table images for instructiontuning (named MMTab-instruct), and 45K held-in and 4K held-out test samples on 23K table images for evaluation (named MMTab-eval).\\nInspired by existing MLLMs which align textual descriptions with input images through image-text pre-training, we introduce the table recognition task as an important pre-training task for multimodal table understanding. In this task, MLLMs learn to generate a textual table representation such as an HTML sequence given the table image, which helps aligning structure and text information in the table image with the ground-truth. We additionally collect 20K table images from the ToTTo (Parikh et al., 2020) training split and merge them with table images in the MMTab-instruct to construct suffcient pre-training data. Based on these table images and their original textual tables, we write scripts to construct table representations of three formats (HTML, Markdown and Latex), and then build instruction-following samples in the same way of MMTab-instruct. The resulting pre-training data contains 150K table recognition samples (HTML: 96K, Markdown: 27K, Latex: 27K) on 97K table images, which is denoted as MMTab-pre.
