{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"MAIN CONJECTURE\\nWe now describe our main conjecture. In this conjecture, and throughout the paper, we consider\\nTransformers \\u201ctrained to completion,\\u201d meaning trained to near-optimal performance on their training\\ndistribution. That is, we assume that in-distribution generalization is achieved nearly-optimally, and\\nfocus our attention on the induced out-of-distribution generalization. The exact training procedure\\nwe consider is given in Section 3.\\nA key ingredient we develop is a restriction of RASP which we call RASP-L, that we describe in\\nmore detail in Section 4. For now, it suffices to say RASP is a human-readable programming lan-\\nguage which defines sequence-to-sequence programs that can be compiled into Transformer weights,\\nsuch that each line of RASP roughly corresponds to one Transformer layer. Our conjecture follows.\\nRASP-Generalization Conjecture. A decoder-only autoregressive Transformer is likely to length-\\ngeneralize when trained to completion on an algorithmic task if the following conditions hold.\\n1. Realizability. The true next-token function for the task can be represented by a single\\ndecoder-only Transformer which works on all input lengths.\\n2. Simplicity. This representation is \\u201csimple\\u201d, meaning it can be written in RASP-L (a learn-\\nable subset of RASP defined in Section 4).\\n1We do not claim the model will be exactly equivalent to the correct algorithm on all possible inputs; this\\nis unlikeley for technical reasons\\u2014 numerical precision, noise in the training and sampling procedures, finite\\noptimization time, etc. However, we can hope for strong approximations.\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n3. Diversity. The training data is sufficiently diverse, such that there does not exist any shorter\\nRASP-L program which agrees with the task in-distribution but not out-of-distribution.\\nThe first condition of realizability is actually quite stringent, because it requires a single Transformer\\nto be able to solve the task at all lengths2. Decoder-only Transformers (also known as causal Trans-\\nformers) define a particular computational model, and not all sequence-to-sequence tasks can be\\nsolved within this model. For example, next-token functions which require \\u2126(n3) computation time\\non inputs of length n provably cannot be represented by a Transformer, however large\\u2014 a conse-\\nquence of the Time Hierarchy Theorem (e.g. Arora & Barak (2009)).\\nThe realizability condition\\nmay seem stronger than required, because in practice, we do not actually need length generalization\\nfor arbitrary unbounded lengths\\u2014 only lengths up to some maximum context size. Nevertheless, we\\nfind that considering representability in the unbounded length setting is a good heuristic for learn-\\nability in bounded length settings. Intuitively, if a task requires a different Transformer for each\\ninput length, then it may be an \\u201cunnatural\\u201d task for Transformers, and unlikely to generalize well.\\nWe emphasize that our conjecture is primarily phenomenological, as opposed to mechanistic. That\\nis, we do not make strong claims about which exact function the Transformer learns, and whether\\nor not it is equivalent to a RASP-L program. Our main conjecture characterizes which tasks Trans-\\nformers are likely to length-generalize on, and not why or how they do so. Although we believe the\\ntoy model is a plausible mechanism that implies our conjecture, we leave investigating this more\\nfully as an important question for future work.\\nLimitations of Scope and Strength.\\nWe acknowledge that our Main Conjecture is not fully for-\\nmal, because there are aspects we do not fully understand. For example, we cannot precisely predict\\nthe extent of length generalization for different tasks. Moreover, since it is likely intractable to de-\\ntermine the minimum RASP-L program that fits a given training set, we cannot predict a priori what\\nforms of \\u201cdata diversity\\u201d are required to ensure strong length generalization, even if our conjecture\\nholds true. Nonetheless, we view our conjecture as a step forward in understanding the implicit bias\\nof Transformers, as it has more predictive power than many prior theories. For example, in Ap-\\npendix H we give a simple theoretical setting where the popular \\u201cmin-degree-interpolator\\u201d model\\nof learning from Abbe et al. (2023) does not correctly predict Transformers\\u2019 out-of-distribution be-\\nhavior, but our conjecture does. Developing more formal and precise conjectures is an important\\nquestion for future work.\\n3\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"page_content\":\"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTransformer architecture and the count task, though, is that a Transformer can easily represent the\\nabove program, uniformly for all input lengths. This is not trivial: we claim that the same exact\\nTransformer weights which solve the task at length 20, can also solve the task at length 50, and all\\ngreater lengths (Figure 1a). In fact, we provide evidence in Appendix C that the trained models are\\nactually implementing this algorithm.\\nThe main message of our work, inspired by the above example, is that it is actually possible for\\nTransformers to approximately1 learn a length-generalizing algorithm, if the correct algorithm is\\nboth possible and \\u201csimple\\u201d to represent with a Transformer. To reason about what is \\u201csimple\\u201d for\\nTransformers, we leverage the RASP programming language (Weiss et al., 2021; Lindner et al.,\\n2023), which is essentially an \\u201cassembly language for Transformers.\\u201d (We describe RASP, and our\\nextension of it RASP-L, in Section 4). We then propose the following toy model of learning.\\nToy Model (RASP Learning).\\nFor symbolic tasks, Transformers tend to learn the shortest\\nRASP-L program which fits the training set, if one exists. Thus, if this minimal program exists\\nand correctly length-generalizes, then so will the Transformer.\\nWe find this toy model to be a useful conceptual tool for predicting when Transformers will length-\\ngeneralize, and is consistent with our experiments on many tasks. Although many prior works\\nhave conjectured similar \\u201csimplicity bias\\u201d in Transformers (Abbe et al., 2023; Bhattamishra et al.,\\n2023), the notion of simplicity we use here is tailor-made for the Transformer architecture: by\\nconstruction, each line of RASP can be compiled into at most 1 layer of a Transformer. Moreover,\\nthis is a notion of simplicity over programs, rather than over functions with fixed input dimension.\\nOur main phenomenological conjecture, described in Section 2, is a more precise version of this toy\\nmodel. On the theoretical side, we also give an example where the \\u201cmin-degree-interpolator\\u201d model\\nof learning from Abbe et al. (2023) does not produce correct predictions for Transformers, but our\\nconjecture does (Appendix H).\\nThe RASP perspective thus helps unify our understanding of length generalization: instead of de-\\nveloping specialized tools to study generalization of each individual task (such as addition, multipli-\\ncation, parity, with and without scratchpads, etc), we can now apply a generic hammer to all tasks.\\nTo predict whether a task is likely to generalize, the RASP Conjecture tells us we should first see\\nif it can be solved by a RASP-L program for all input distributions. While we focus on studying\\nlength generalization in this work, we expect the intuitions developed here can apply to systematic\\ngeneralization more broadly.\\n2\\nMAIN CONJECTURE\\nWe now describe our main conjecture. In this conjecture, and throughout the paper, we consider\\nTransformers \\u201ctrained to completion,\\u201d meaning trained to near-optimal performance on their training\\ndistribution. That is, we assume that in-distribution generalization is achieved nearly-optimally, and\\nfocus our attention on the induced out-of-distribution generalization. The exact training procedure\\nwe consider is given in Section 3.\\nA key ingredient we develop is a restriction of RASP which we call RASP-L, that we describe in\\nmore detail in Section 4. For now, it suffices to say RASP is a human-readable programming lan-\\nguage which defines sequence-to-sequence programs that can be compiled into Transformer weights,\\nsuch that each line of RASP roughly corresponds to one Transformer layer. Our conjecture follows.\\nRASP-Generalization Conjecture. A decoder-only autoregressive Transformer is likely to length-\\ngeneralize when trained to completion on an algorithmic task if the following conditions hold.\\n1. Realizability. The true next-token function for the task can be represented by a single\\ndecoder-only Transformer which works on all input lengths.\\n2. Simplicity. This representation is \\u201csimple\\u201d, meaning it can be written in RASP-L (a learn-\\nable subset of RASP defined in Section 4).\\n1We do not claim the model will be exactly equivalent to the correct algorithm on all possible inputs; this\\nis unlikeley for technical reasons\\u2014 numerical precision, noise in the training and sampling procedures, finite\\noptimization time, etc. However, we can hope for strong approximations.\\n3\\n\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
