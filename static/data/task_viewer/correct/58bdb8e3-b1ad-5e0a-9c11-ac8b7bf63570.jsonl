{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "[Question]: On average, how many steps does a solution have in the training set of PRM800K, and how many solutions are provided per question?\n[Answer Format]: Your answer should be a Python list containing two floating-point numbers, each rounded to two decimal places.

However, even state-of-the-art models still regularly produce logical mistakes. To train more reliable models, we can turn either to outcome supervision, which provides feedback for a final result, or process supervision, which provides feedback for each intermediate reasoning step. Given the importance of training reliable models, and given the high cost of human feedback, it is important to carefully compare the both methods. Recent work has already begun this comparison, but many questions still remain. We conduct our own investigation, finding that process supervision significantly outperforms outcome supervision for training models to solve problems from the challenging MATH dataset. Our process-supervised model solves 78% of problems from a representative subset of the MATH test set. Additionally, we show that active learning significantly improves the efficacy of process supervision.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"DISCUSSION\\n6.1\\nCREDIT ASSIGNMENT\\nOne clear advantage of process supervision is that it provides more precise feedback than outcome\\nsupervision. A reward model trained with outcome supervision faces a difficult credit-assignment\\n7\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\ntask \\u2014 to generalize well, it must determine where an incorrect solution went wrong. This is par-\\nticularly difficult for hard problems: most model-generated solutions contain an error somewhere,\\nso the marginal value of a negative label from outcome supervision is low. In contrast, process su-\\npervision provides a richer signal: it specifies both how many of the first steps were in fact correct,\\nas well as the precise location of the incorrect step. Process supervision makes credit assignment\\neasier, and we believe that this explains its strong performance.\\n6.2\\nALIGNMENT IMPACT\\nProcess supervision has several advantages over outcome supervision related to AI alignment. Pro-\\ncess supervision is more likely to produce interpretable reasoning, since it encourages models to\\nfollow a process endorsed by humans. Process supervision is also inherently safer: it directly re-\\nwards an aligned chain-of-thought rather than relying on outcomes as a proxy for aligned behavior\\n(Stuhlm\\u00a8\\nuller & Byun, 2022). In contrast, outcome supervision is harder to scrutinize, and the prefer-\\nences conveyed are less precise. In the worst case, the use of outcomes as an imperfect proxy could\\nlead to models that become misaligned after learning to exploit the reward signal (Uesato et al.,\\n2022; Cotra, 2022; Everitt et al., 2017).\\nIn some cases, safer methods for AI systems can lead to reduced performance (Ouyang et al., 2022;\\nAskell et al., 2021), a cost which is known as an alignment tax. In general, any alignment tax may\\nhinder the adoption of alignment methods, due to pressure to deploy the most capable model. Our\\nresults show that process supervision in fact incurs a negative alignment tax. This could lead to\\nincreased adoption of process supervision, which we believe would have positive alignment side-\\neffects. It is unknown how broadly these results will generalize beyond the domain of math, and we\\nconsider it important for future work to explore the impact of process supervision in other domains.\\n6.3\\nTEST SET CONTAMINATION\\nThe test set of the MATH dataset contains problems that are discussed in several online venues, and it\\nis likely that some of these problems appear in the pretraining dataset for our models. We attempted\\nto remove all MATH problems from our MathMix dataset using string-matching heuristics, but since\\nhumans can post hard-to-detect rephrasings of a problem online, it is difficult to make any strong\\nguarantees about the overlap between MathMix and the MATH dataset.\\nIn our experience inspecting model-generated solutions, we saw no clear signs of our models mem-\\norizing MATH problems. However, it is impossible to rule out subtle forms of memorization that\\nwould slip past manual inspection, and it is still possible that some degree of contamination has\\nslightly inflated our performance on the MATH test set. Even in that case, we would expect any\\ncontamination to manifest similarly across all methods, and that the relative comparisons made\\nthroughout this work would remain mostly unaffected.\\nWe also note that the PRM regularly surfaces correct solutions to MATH problems that have a low\\nsingle-digit percentage solve-rate under the generator, some examples of which can be seen in Ap-\\npendix I. The generator\\u2019s low solve-rate is an additional indication that it has not encountered such\\nproblems via test set contamination. Our generalization results from Section 5 further strengthen\\nour claim that test set contamination has not significantly impacted this work, since we observe\\nqualitatively similar results on problems that are guaranteed to be uncontaminated.\\n7\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
