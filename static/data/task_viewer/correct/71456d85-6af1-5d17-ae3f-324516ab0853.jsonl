{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

As such, they are more interpretable, and could potentially achieve better generalization performance than supervised methods, because noise characteristics are modeled and learned only at test time [3, 4].\\nA disadvantage of unsupervised methods is that they are ineffcient at test time, because of the iterative EM process. The computational bottleneck comes from the expectation step, which involves an intractable posterior distribution over the latent vectors of the model. This is tackled by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based sampling method in [4]. A variational EM (VEM) algorithm is proposed in [11] to approximate the posterior with a parametric Gaussian form. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally expensive. An optimization-based method is also proposed in [11, 12] that approximates the intractable posterior using only its mode. This, however, leads to performance degradation as the involved posterior is usually multi-modal. An alternative approach is proposed in [13] which reuses the pre-trained model to approximate the intractable posterior, leading to a fast inference algorithm. However, its performance depends largely on the quality and generalization capability of the learned speech model.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1. INTRODUCTION\",\"section_content\":\"Speech enhancement based on deep generative models has attracted much attention recently [1\\u20137]. In particular, unsupervised speech enhancement based on variational autoencoder (VAE) [8] consists of a pre-training phase during which a deep speech prior is learned using only clean speech data. At test time, the learned speech prior is used to infer a target clean speech from a given noisy audio recording, e.g., by computing the posterior mean. In this step, a parametric Gaussian noise model is considered whose parameters are learned from the observed noisy speech signal based on expectation-maximization (EM) [3, 4].\\nThis framework stays in contrast with the supervised methods based on deep learning, which train a deep neural architecture to directly map a given noisy speech signal to a clean version or a time-frequency mask [9], without explicitly modeling the statistical characteristics of speech signals. On the other hand, unsupervised methods extend the traditional speech enhancement approaches based on linear statistical models, e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), by\\nIn this paper, we develop a computationally effcient sampling framework based on Langevin dynamics [14] to approximate the intractable posterior in the EM phase. This consists of generating multiple sets of samples by using only the gradient information of the log posterior along with injecting stochastic noise to better explore high-density regions of the posterior. Moreover, to incorporate the temporal correlations between consecutive latent vectors, we propose a total variation (TV) based regularization that further improves the performance. The proposed framework makes an effective compromise between the MCMC and optimization-based methods in terms of output quality and computations during the EM phase. Our experiments on speech enhancement confrm that the proposed methodology demonstrates a promising performance and outperforms the previous approaches.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews VAE-based speech prior learning and enhancement. The proposed speech enhancement framework is detailed in Section 3. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4. EXPERIMENTS\",\"section_content\":\"Baselines. In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed LDEM framework for speech enhancement, and compare it with the PEEM and MCEM methods [11]. We used the publicly available PyTorch implementations of the two latter methods1, and implemented LDEM based on that. We also tested the VEM method of [11] using its available implementation, but, unfortunately, it did not work. The poor performance of VEM was already observed in [11]. Furthermore, there is no public code for the method of [13], and our own implementation did not work. Therefore, we excluded these two methods from the baselines.\\nEvaluation metrics. The speech enhancement performance is measured based on the standard metrics, including the short-term objective intelligibility (STOI) measure [16], ranging in [0, 1], the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score [17], ranging in $[-0.5,4.5]$ , and the scaleinvariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) [18] in dB. Moreover, as a rough measure of the computational complexity of different methods, we report the average runtime in seconds. Our experiments were performed on an Intel Xeon Gold 6130 CPU machine.\\nVAE architecture. The architecture of the VAE considered in our experiments follows the one proposed in [4], which consists of an encoder and decoder, each having a 128-node single fully-connected hidden layer with hyperbolic tangent activation functions. The dimension of the latent space is set\\nto $L=32$\\nDatasets. To train the VAE model, we used the speech data in the TCD-TIMIT corpus [19], which contains speech utterances from 56 English speakers (39 for training, 8 for validation, and 9 for testing) with an Irish accent. There are 98 different audio fles per speaker, each with an approximate length of 5 seconds, and sampled at $16\\\\;\\\\mathrm{kHz}$ . This results in about 8 hours of data. The STFT of the speech data is computed with a 1024 samples-long $(64~\\\\mathrm{ms})$ sine window, $75\\\\%$ overlap, and without zero-padding, yielding STFT frames of length $F=513$ .\\nTo evaluate the speech enhancement performance, we used some pre-computed noisy versions of the TCD-TIMIT data presented in [20]. This includes six different noise types, namely Living Room $(L R)$ , White, Caf\\u00b4e, Car, Babble, and Street, with fve noise levels: $-10$ dB, $-5$ dB, 0 dB, 5 dB, and ${}^{10}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{dB}$ . For each noise type and noise level, we randomly selected 5 audio fles from each test speaker, which resulted in a total of 1350 test fles.\\nParameters setting. The VAE model was trained with a batch size of 128 using the Adam optimizer [21], with a learning rate of 0.0001. We used early stopping on the validation set with patience of 20 epochs (i.e., training stops if the validation loss does not improve after 20 epochs). The number of EM iterations is set to $J\\\\,=\\\\,100$ for all the methods. The MCEM algorithm was run using the default setting considered in [11]. The number of iterations in the E-step has been set to $K=10$ for both PEEM and LDEM. The Adam optimizer has been used for PEEM, as in [11], with a learning rate of 0.005. For LDEM, we set $\\\\eta=0.005$ and $\\\\sigma^{2}=0.01$ . We have tried different values for the regularization parameter, $\\\\lambda$ , and the number of samples, $m$ .\\nResults. The speech enhancement results per noise level are reported in Table 1. The average runtimes of different methods per each test sample $\\\\sim5$ -second long) are reported in Table 2. We can draw several conclusions by inspecting the results. First, it can clearly be seen that LDEM, even without TV regularization and with $m=1$ , signifcantly outperforms PEEM in all the metrics, e.g., 2.7 dB average performance gain in SI-SDR, with approximately the same runtime. Moreover, LDEM achieves approximately the same PESQ scores as MCEM, but outperforms it in terms of SI-SDR, while having a much lower runtime. However, the STOI scores of LDEM are lower than those of MCEM.\\n\\nAs we increase $\\\\lambda$ (TV regularization parameter), we see a clear performance improvement, such that for $\\\\lambda=5$ , LDEM outperforms MCEM in terms of PESQ, while showing similar performance in terms of SI-SDR and STOI. Again, LDEM achieves this with a much lower runtime. Furthermore, increasing the number of samples, $m$ , causes a performance boost, such that, with a lower runtime, LDEM demonstrates better enhancement metrics than MCEM.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5.
