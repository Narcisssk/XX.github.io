{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Our diverse model selection ensures the validity and robustness of our findings. We bench-\\nmark StreamingLLM against established baselines such as dense attention, window attention, and the\\nsliding window approach with re-computation. In all subsequent experiments with StreamingLLM,\\nwe default to using four initial tokens as attention sinks unless stated otherwise.\\n4.1\\nLANGUAGE MODELING ON LONG TEXTS ACROSS LLM FAMILIES AND SCALES\\nWe firstly evaluate StreamingLLM\\u2019s language modeling perplexity using the concatenated PG19 (Rae\\net al., 2020) test set, which contains 100 long books. For Llama-2 models, the cache size is set at\\n2048, while for Falcon, Pythia, and MPT models, it\\u2019s set at 1024. This is half the pre-training window\\nsize chosen to enhance visualization clarity.\\nFigure 3 illustrates that StreamingLLM can match the oracle baseline (sliding window with re-\\ncomputation) in terms of perplexity on texts spanning 20K tokens. Meanwhile, the dense attention\\ntechnique fails when the input length exceeds its pre-training window, and the window attention\\ntechnique struggles when the input length surpasses the cache size, leading to the eviction of the initial\\ntokens. In Figure 5, we further substantiate that StreamingLLM can reliably handle exceptionally\\nextended texts, encompassing more than 4 million tokens, across a spectrum of model families and\\nscales. This includes Llama-2-[7,13,70]B, Falcon-[7,40]B, Pythia-[2.8,6.9,12]B, and MPT-[7,30]B.\\n6\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nDense Attention\\nWindow Attention\\nStreamingLLM\\nFigure 5: Language modeling perplexity of StreamingLLM on super long texts with 4 million tokens across\\nvarious LLM families and scales. The perplexity remains stable throughout. We use the concatenated test set of\\nPG19 (100 books) to perform language modeling, with perplexity fluctuations due to book transitions.\\nPre-Trained without Sink Token\\nPre-Trained with Sink Token\\nLayer 0 Head 0\\nLayer 2 Head 0\\nLayer 10 Head 0\\nLayer 0 Head 0\\nLayer 2 Head 0\\nLayer 10 Head 0\\nFigure 7: Visualization of average attention logits over 256 sentences, each 16 tokens long, comparing models\\npre-trained without (left) and with (right) a sink token. Both maps show the same layers and heads. Key\\nobservations: (1) Without a sink token, models show local attention in lower layers and increased attention\\nto initial tokens in deeper layers. (2) With a sink token, there is clear attention directed at it across all layers,\\neffectively collecting redundant attention. (3) With the presence of the sink token, less attention is given to other\\ninitial tokens, supporting the benefit of designating the sink token to enhance the streaming performance.\\n4.2\\nRESULTS OF PRE-TRAINING WITH A SINK TOKEN\\nTo validate our suggestion that introducing a sink token to all pre-training samples improves stream-\\ning LLMs, we trained two language models, each with 160 million parameters, under identical\\nconditions. While one model adhered to the original training settings, the other incorporated a sink\\ntoken at the start of every training sample. Our experiments employed the Pythia-160M (Bider-\\nman et al., 2023) codebase and followed its training recipe. We train the models on an 8xA6000\\nNVIDIA GPU server using the deduplicated Pile (Gao et al., 2020) dataset. Apart from reducing\\nthe training batch size to 256, we retained all Pythia training configurations, including learning rate\\nschedules, model initialization, and dataset permutations. Both models were trained for 143,000 steps.\\nFigure 6:\\nPre-training loss\\ncurves of models w\\/ and w\\/o sink\\ntokens.

We evaluate the two models on seven diverse NLP bench-\\nmarks, including ARC-[Challenge, Easy] (Clark et al., 2018), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019),\\nLAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016), OpenbookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020),\\nand Winogrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2019). As shown in Table 4, the model pre-trained with a sink\\ntoken performs similarly to that trained using the vanilla approach.\\nStreaming Performance.\\nAs illustrated in Table 3, the streaming perplexities differ between\\nmodels trained using traditional methods and those augmented with a sink token. Remarkably,\\nthe vanilla model requires the addition of multiple tokens as attention sinks to maintain stable\\nstreaming perplexity. In contrast, the model trained with a sink token achieves satisfactory streaming\\nperformance using just the sink token.\\n7\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTable 5: Accuracy (in %) on the ARC-[Easy, Challenge] datasets.

In contrast, models trained with a\\nsink token consistently concentrate on the sink across layers\\nand heads, indicating an effective attention offloading mech-\\nanism. This strong focus on the sink, with reduced attention\\nto other initial tokens, explains the sink token\\u2019s efficacy in\\nenhancing model\\u2019s streaming performance.\\n4.3\\nRESULTS ON STREAMING QUESTION\\nANSWERING WITH INSTRUCTION-TUNED MODELS\\nTo show StreamingLLM\\u2019s real-world applicability, we emulate multi-round question-answering using\\ninstruction-tuned LLMs, commonly used in real-world scenarios.\\nWe first concatenate all question-answer pairs from the ARC-[Challenge, Easy] datasets, feed the\\ncontinuous stream to Llama-2-[7,13,70]B-Chat models, and assess model completions at each answer\\nposition using an exact match criterion. As table 5 indicates, dense attention results in Out-of-Memory\\n(OOM) errors, showing it unsuitable for this setting. While the window attention method works\\nefficiently, it exhibits low accuracy due to random outputs when the input length exceeds the cache\\nsize. Conversely, StreamingLLM excels by efficiently handling the streaming format, aligning with\\nthe one-shot, sample-by-sample baseline accuracy.\\nHighlighting a more fitting scenario for StreamingLLM, we introduce a dataset, StreamEval, inspired\\nby the LongEval (Li et al., 2023) benchmark. As depicted in Figure 8, diverging from LongEval\\u2019s\\nsingle query over a long-span setup, we query the model every 10 lines of new information. Each\\nquery\\u2019s answer is consistently 20 lines prior, reflecting real-world instances where questions typically\\npertain to recent information. As illustrated in Figure 9, LLMs employing StreamingLLM maintain\\nreasonable accuracy even as input lengths approach 120K tokens. In contrast, both dense and window\\nattention fail at the pre-training text length and the KV cache size, respectively. Additionally, we\\nutilize two context-extended models, LongChat-7b-v1.5-32k (Li et al., 2023) and Llama-2-7B-32K-\\nInstruct (Together, 2023), to show that StreamingLLM can complement context extension techniques.\\nWithin StreamingLLM, context extension means broadening the maximum cache size of streaming\\nLLMs, enabling the capture of broader local information.\\n8\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nLatency (ms)\\n0\\n400\\n800\\n1200\\n1600\\n256\\n512\\n1024\\n2048\\n4096\\n65\\n45\\n35\\n31\\n31\\n1411\\n523\\n223\\n103\\n63\\nSliding Window with Re-computation\\nStreamingLLM\\nMemory (GB)\\n0\\n7\\n14\\n21\\n256\\n512\\n1024\\n2048\\n4096\\n19\\n16\\n14\\n13\\n13\\n21\\n16\\n14\\n13\\n13\\nLatency (ms)\\n0\\n750\\n1500\\n2250\\n3000\\n256\\n512\\n1024\\n2048\\n4096\\n106\\n75\\n60\\n52\\n48\\n2355\\n860\\n361\\n169\\n99\\nMemory (GB)\\n0\\n10\\n19\\n29\\n38\\n256\\n512\\n1024\\n2048\\n4096\\n34\\n29\\n27\\n26\\n25\\n36\\n29\\n26\\n25\\n25\\nLlama-2-7B\\nLlama-2-13B\\nFigure 10: Comparison of per-token decoding latency and memory usage between the sliding window approach\\nwith re-computation baseline and StreamingLLM, plotted against the cache size (attention window size) on the\\nX-axis.

The results show the insufficiency of introduc-\\ning merely one or two initial tokens, whereas a threshold of four initial tokens appears enough, with\\nsubsequent additions contributing marginal effects. This result justifies our choice of introducing 4\\ninitial tokens as attention sinks in StreamingLLM.\\nCache Sizes.\\nIn Table 6, we evaluate cache size\\u2019s impact on StreamingLLM\\u2019s perplex-\\nity.\\nContrary to intuition, increasing the cache size doesn\\u2019t consistently lower the lan-\\nguage modeling perplexity. This inconsistency shows a potential limitation where these mod-\\nels might not maximize the utility of the entire context they receive.\\nFuture research ef-\\nforts should target enhancing these models\\u2019 capabilities to utilize extensive contexts better.\\nTable 6: Effects of cache size on StreamingLLM\\u2019s\\nperformance.\\nIncreasing the cache size in\\nStreamingLLM doesn\\u2019t consistently yield a de-\\ncrease in perplexity, showing these models may\\nnot fully utilize the provided context. Cache config\\nx+y denotes adding x initial tokens with y recent\\ntokens. Perplexity is evaluated on 400K tokens in\\nthe concatenated PG19 test set.\\nCache\\n4+252 4+508 4+1020 4+2044\\nFalcon-7B\\n13.61\\n12.84\\n12.34\\n12.84\\nMPT-7B\\n14.12\\n14.25\\n14.33\\n14.99\\nPythia-12B\\n13.17\\n12.52\\n12.08\\n12.09\\nCache\\n4+508 4+1020 4+2044 4+4092\\nLlama-2-7B\\n9.73\\n9.32\\n9.08\\n9.59\\n4.5\\nEFFICENCY RESULTS\\nWe benchmark StreamingLLM\\u2019s decoding latency\\nand memory usage against the sliding window with\\nre-computation, which is the only baseline with ac-\\nceptable quality.

Despite its reduced\\nlatency, StreamingLLM sustains a memory footprint\\nconsistent with the re-computation baseline.\\n5\",\"section_summary\":\"StreamingLLM improves long-text language modeling and streaming performance across various LLMs, outperforming dense and window attention methods.
