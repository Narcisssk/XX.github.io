{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Nevertheless, most existing work adopts the setting of learning\\nan opponent model online, which is prohibitively impractical and inefficient. In practical situations,\\nit is not always feasible to engage with the competitive environment or opponent policies to execute\\nthe online learning process. For instance, e-commerce platforms are constrained to modeling the\\nbehavior of specific users offline by passively accumulating their data (Li & Zhao, 2021). Even if\\nonline learning is available, the opponent may have switched the policy across episodes, possibly\\nlong before the current opponent\\u2019s model is learned. Then a multitude of rollouts are necessary to\\nacquire a new opponent model, which is exorbitantly inefficient (Albrecht & Stone, 2018).\\nGiven the multifaceted issues in learning the opponent model online, we contemplate extending\\nthe opponent modeling problem into the offline setting, a concept we refer to as Offline Opponent\\nModeling (OOM), to make learning more accessible and enhance the sample efficiency of opponent\\nmodeling. The underlying insight is that acquiring replay data or historical plays of a certain quality\\n1\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nOffline\\nDataset\\nOpponent\\nPolicy Encoder\\nEmbed to Latent Space\\nemb.\\ntraj.\\n(a)\\nOffline\\nDataset\\nOpponent\\nPolicy Encoder\\nIn-context\\nControl Decoder\\nLearn to Respond\\nemb.\\naction\\ntraj.\\ntraj.\\nby Offline Traj.\\ntraj_frag.\\n(b)\\nOpponent\\nPolicy Encoder\\nIn-context\\nControl Decoder\\nAdapt with In-context Learning\\nunseen\\nseen\\nOpponent\\nContext Window\\nemb.\\ntraj.\\naction\\ntraj.\\nby Interacting with Env.\\ntraj_frag.\\n(c)\\nFigure 1: Procedures of TAO.

The acquired offline data can be used to learn the\\nresponse policy against the fixed opponent policy found in offline data rather than undertaking thou-\\nsands of rollouts to learn through trial and error. Numerous real-life applications echo this principle.\\nFor instance, mastering strategies to handle certain scenarios in Go games through practicing high-\\nquality Go exercises; understanding the basketball playing styles and patterns of specific opponents\\nby analyzing replay videos of their NBA performances (Daly-Grafstein & Bornn, 2020).\\nRecent studies have shown that the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), supervised pre-trained for\\ndecision-making, possesses a robust in-context learning ability in meta-Reinforcement Learning\\n(RL) (Lee et al., 2023). This ability is exactly what is demanded in opponent modeling. Such insight\\nstems from the fact that when we deploy the opponent model into a new environment, we expect\\nto adapt to unknown opponent policies as swiftly as possible, ideally without gradient updates. We\\nprovide the related work on opponent modeling, offline meta-RL, etc. in Appendix A.\\nEmbracing this idea, we introduce Transformer Against Opponents (TAO), a general Transformer-\\nbased approach dedicated to resolving the defined OOM problem. The procedures of TAO unfolds in\\nthree stages (see Fig. 1): 1) We generatively and discriminatively embed opponent trajectories using\\nan Opponent Policy Encoder (OPE) to acquire an opponent policy representation that is beneficial\\nfor the downstream learning; 2) Upon the characterization of opponent policies offered by OPE,\\nwe adopt in-context learning-based supervised pre-training for an In-context Control Decoder\\n(ICD) to learn to respond reasonably according to opponent trajectories; 3) We deploy in a new\\nenvironment inhabited by unknown opponent policies and adapt with in-context learning with the\\nhelp of an Opponent Context Window (OCW), which continuously collects opponent trajectories.\\nTheoretically, we prove that TAO is equivalent to Bayesian posterior sampling in opponent mod-\\neling. Further analysis demonstrates the convergence of TAO for opponent policy recognition. We\\nconduct experiments in both a sparse reward and a dense reward environment, comparing TAO with\\na series of baselines for opponent modeling and offline meta-RL. Our approach demonstrates out-\\nstanding performance under different kinds of test settings. Concurrently, ablation studies on TAO\\u2019s\\ncomponents underscore their vital roles in the process. Surprisingly, when we deploy TAO into a\\nnew environment inhabited by unknown opponent policies, it exhibits a faster and superior adap-\\ntation than other approaches, particularly in confronting previously unseen opponent policies. This\\nunderlines the formidable in-context learning capability inherent in our approach.\\n2\"}\n{\"abstract\":\"Opponent modeling aims at learning the opponent's behaviors, goals, or beliefs to reduce the uncertainty of the competitive environment and assist decision-making.

On the one hand, online learning struggles to satisfy real-world scenarios,\\ngiven that interactions with opponent policies are not consistently accessible. On the other hand,\\nonline learning of opponent models bears substantial complexity and inefficiency. As with many\\nexisting algorithms, they gather copious data and undertake intricate online updating processes.\\nRelationship with offline meta-RL. The core objective of offline meta-RL lies in addressing task\\nadaptation problems using offline datasets within a single-agent environment. In contrast, OOM\\nmainly focuses on opponent adaptation using offline datasets within a multi-agent setting. In a\\nbroader sense, OOM can be perceived as a specialized extension of offline meta-RL. Specifically, the\\nheightened challenge of OOM compared to offline meta-RL stems from the increased complexity of\\nenvironment dynamics arising due to opponent policies and the involvement of multiple agents.\\nMain Challenges. As implied by Eq. (1), the main challenges of OOM arise from several dimen-\\nsions: 1) OOM requires effective learning of high-level semantics from different opponent policies to\\naid controlled agent\\u2019s decision-making; 2) OOM necessitates extraction of robust response policies\\nagainst corresponding opponent policies from Doff; 3) OOM emphasizes generalization, a crucial\\naspect for transferring the garnered high-level knowledge to adapt to unseen opponent policies.\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "[Thought]: The top result from the vectorstore search provides the most relevant information. It mentions the three stages of the TAO approach, which includes adapting to unknown opponent policies during deployment. I will use this information to formulate the final answer.\n[Action]:\nGenerateAnswer(answer='The system, Transformer Against Opponent (TAO), efficiently adapts to completely unfamiliar opponent policies during deployment through in-context learning, while still maintaining performance with known policies. This is achieved through three stages: 1) Offline policy embedding learning to capture high-level semantics from different opponent policies, 2) Offline opponent-aware response policy training to generate approximate best responses to different opponent policies, and 3) Deployment stage where the system accumulates information in new environments and adapts to unknown opponent policies using in-context learning.')"}
