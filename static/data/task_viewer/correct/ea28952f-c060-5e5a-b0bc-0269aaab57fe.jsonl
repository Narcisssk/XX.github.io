{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"A good audio codec for live applications such as telecommunication is characterized by three key properties: (1) compression, i.e. the bitrate that is required to transmit the signal should be as low as possible; (2) latency, i.e. encoding and decoding the signal needs to be fast enough to enable communication without or with only minimal noticeable delay; and (3) reconstruction quality of the signal. In this work, we propose an open-source, streamable, and real-time neural audio codec that achieves strong performance along all three axes: it can reconstruct highly natural sounding $48\\\\ \\\\mathrm{kHz}$ speech signals while operating at only 12 kbps and running with less than 6 ms (GPU)\\/10 ms (CPU) latency. An effcient training paradigm is also demonstrated for developing such neural audio codecs for real-world scenarios. Both objective and subjective evaluations using the VCTK corpus are provided. To sum up, AudioDec is a welldeveloped plug-and-play benchmark for audio codec applications.\\nIndex Terms\\u2014 audio codec, end-to-end neural network, opensource, streaming, high-fdelity audio generation\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"An audio codec is a technique to compress audio signals into codes and reconstruct the audio signals on the basis of the codes. A typical audio codec system is composed of encoder, quantizer, and decoder modules. The bitrate of the quantized codes is usually much lower than that of the input audio signals, so the codes are suitable for transmissions or storage. Audio codec techniques have been applied to a variety of real-world applications such as secure communication [1, 2], low-cost mobile and internet communications [3, 4], and live videos and music streamings [5].\\nMost of the conventional parametric codecs [6\\u20138] were built according to in-domain knowledge of psychoacoustics, human speech production systems, and traditional digital signal processing. Although the bitrate is low, the quality is also low because of bandwidth limitations. Modern parametric audio codecs [9\\u201311] usually achieve acceptable reconstruction quality with $16~\\\\mathrm{kHz}$ or higher sampling rate audio signals as a consequence of the advanced transmission techniques. However, the ad hoc designs and limited modeling capacity of these codecs still result in a signifcant quality gap between natural and reconstructed audio signals.\\nRecently, the rapid developments of neural networks (NNs) provide advanced modeling capacity, so many neural codecs have been proposed in past years. The frst category is the hybrid codec, which replaces or integrates part of the parametric codecs\\u2019 modules with NNs to improve the compression or reconstruction performances. For example, Krishnamurthy et al. [12] proposed a neural vector quantizer for speech and image coding. Wu et al. [13]. proposed a neural predictive speech coder with coded excitation inputs. NNbased encoder-decoder structures also have been proposed for different handcraft acoustic features such as spectrograms [14], phonological features, and pitches [15]. However, these codecs still require lots of ad hoc designs for speech signals.\\nThe second category is the vocoder-based codec, which directly reconstructs audio signals using neural vocoders conditioned on the codes from other parametric coders [16] or quantized acoustic features [17\\u201319]. However, the performance and bitrate of vocoderbased codecs are still bonded with the upstream handcraft encoding. To theoretically achieve global optimations and fexible bitrates, end-to-end autoencoders (E2E AEs) with raw waveform I\\/O [20\\u201327] recently have been investigated. Although these E2E codecs usually attain high-fdelity speech generations, the open-source benchmark is unavailable, the effcient training paradigm is unclear, the comparison to vocoder-based methods is absent, and the system for different applications is infexible.\\nTo tackle these issues, we present an open-source E2E neural codec, AudioDec1, with an effcient training paradigm in this paper. The modularized architecture provides the fexibility of developing systems for different applications. Specifcally, since both the encoder and decoder are easily replaceable, we can separately develop several specifc encoders and decoders for any applications and easily integrate or switch among them for different real-world scenarios such as binaural rendering [28]. One of the state-of-the-art neural vocoders, HiFi-GAN [29], is integrated into our codec, and we argue that the combination of a separate powerful vocoder and a welltrained encoder will attain the highest quality. For practicality, we adopt a group convolution mechanism to make the streamable network run in real-time with low latency on both GPU and CPU. Both objective and subjective experiments are conducted, and the comparisons to the vocoder-based mode are also presented. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed codec to generate high-fdelity $48~\\\\mathrm{kHz}$ speech and give more insight into effciently building a practical neural codec.\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since AudioDec adopts an E2E AE-based architecture with the SoundStram backbone [25], the E2E AE-based audio codec foundations and the baseline SoundStream are introduced in this chapter.\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"A typical E2E AE-based codec consists of encoder, projector, quantizer, and decoder modules. In the encoding stage, raw waveform signals are encoded into representations with a much lower temporal resolution and then projected to the designed multidimensional space. The projected representations are further quantized into codes for transmission or storage. In the decoding stage, the codes are frst transferred to the representations by a lookup process, and then the decoder reconstructs the raw waveform based on the representations. Morishima et al. [20] proposed the frst NN-based AE codec with raw waveform I\\/O, but the quantizer applied to the bottleneck features is not jointly trained.\\nTo jointly optimize all modules, many E2E AEs adopting vector quantization (VQ) [30] have been proposed to tackle the gradient of the VQ. For example, the neural codecs with softmax quantization [21], straight-through gradient, exponential moving average (EMA) [22, 23], and Gumble-softmax [31] have been recently proposed and work well for gradient propagation. In addition, the bitrate is directly related to the VQ codebook size, but training the model with a huge plain codebook is impractical. Therefore, scalable codecs decomposing the fne-coarse structures of the encoded latent codes using residual VQ [25], multi-scale VQ [26], and crossscale VQ [27] or the output waveforms using cross-module residual learning [24] are introduced for tractable hierarchical codebooks.\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"SoundStream is an E2E AE-based neural codec adopting the residual VQ mechanism.

To meet the streamable and real-time requirements, SoundStream adopts a fully causal convolution architecture. The causality makes the network encode\\/decode audio signals based on only previous samples, so the whole process can run in a continuous segmental manner. The convolution network takes advantage of parallel computations for effcient encoding\\/decoding.\\nBoth metric and adversarial losses are adopted to train the model.

Two types of fully convolutional discriminators are utilized, and the main difference is that the short-time Fourier transform discriminator (STFTD) takes a complex spectrogram as the input while the multi-scale discriminators (MSDs) [32] take a waveform as the input. All discriminators adopt the hinge loss over the discriminator output logits.

Specifcally, in contrast to the very lightweight generator, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model usually requires multiple deep discriminators to achieve highfdelity generation [33], and training these discriminators is timeconsuming. However, the GAN training is mostly related to improving the waveform details, high-frequency components, and phase synchronization while modeling the low-frequency component can be learned solely with the metric losses. As a result, directly training the model with both metric and adversarial losses from scratch is ineffcient. In addition, training a specifc SoundStream model from scratch for each scenario is required, but a practical system should be fexibly adjusted for different scenarios such as switching between mono and binaural outputs according to the user\\u2019s hardware.\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To improve the training effciency, model fexibility, and audio quality of SoundStream, we propose an effcient training paradigm and a modularized architecture and adopt the HiFi-GAN-based multiperiod discriminator for developing the AudioDec codec.

By fxing the quantizer and codebook, we can easily develop arbitrarily encoders and decoders for any new scenarios.\\nFurthermore, we fnd that the symmetric encoder-decoder architecture is essential for the training stability of an AE. However, the waveform decoder is usually expected to be more powerful to cover all details of the high-resolution audio signals while the encoder is expected to preserve limited essential information of the input audio signals. That is, asymmetric architecture tends to be unstable, and symmetric powerful architecture is ineffcient. Therefore, the modularized architecture provides a more fexible design that the decoder of a well-trained lightweight AE codec can be easily replaced by powerful vocoders, and the following experiments actually show that running AudioDec in a vocoder-based mode using a separately trained HiFi-GAN vocoder achieves the best performance.\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The Valentini dataset [35], which is derived from the VCTK corpus [36], is adopted for the evaluations. This English corpus includes 84 gender-balance speakers with accents from England, Scotland, and United States for training and two England speakers (female p257 and male p232) for testing. The number of available utterances of each speaker is around 400. The sample rate of all data is $48\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kHz}$ .\\nThe baseline SoundStream (SS), two symmetric AudioDec (symAD), one asymmetric AudioDec (asymAD), and three vocoderbased AudioDec (AD) systems are evaluated in this chapter. Specifcally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed training paradigm, two AudioDecs with symmetric encoder-decoder were respectively trained with and without fxing the encoder during the training of the decoder and discriminators. To investigate the importance of symmetric structure, an asymmetric AudioDec adopting a powerful HiFi-GAN-like decoder with the lightweight AudioDec encoder was trained following the proposed training paradigm. To compare with the vocoder-based approach, three HiFi-GANs including vanilla MRF with kernel sizes 3, 7, and 11 (v0), three group convolutions with kernel size 11 (v1), and three group convolutions with kernel size 3 (v2) were trained using the global normalized codes extracted from the natural waveforms by the well-trained AudioDec encoder.\\nThe neural network architecture and hyperparameters of SS, symADs, asymAD, and ADs followed the settings in the binaural SS paper [28]. Compared with SS, the main modifcations of the proposed AudioDec models are the training paradigm, modularized architecture for switching between symmetric and vocoder-based modes, replacing STFTD with MPDs, and adopting LS-GAN for training. The HiFi-GAN-based vocoders followed the popular opensource repository2. The number of overall training iterations is $700\\\\mathbf{k}$ . The encoders, quantizers, and codebooks of the models with the proposed training paradigm were fxed after the frst 200k training. The HiFi-GAN-based vocoders were trained with 500k iterations to match the overall training iterations. The downsampling rate was set to 300, and each code was represented by eight codebooks with a 1024 book size $\\\\leftmoon\\\\times10$ bits), so the bitrate of each codec is 12.8 kbps for $48\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kHz}$ audio coding. Details can be referred to our repository1.\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Five objective measurements were adopted, and the results are the averages of all testing utterances. Specifcally, speech quality and prosody are two main factors for evaluating codecs. To evaluate the speech prosody, root mean square errors of fundamental frequency $\\\\langle F_{0}{\\\\bf R M S E})$ and unvoice\\/voice $(U\\/V)$ errors were adopted. To evaluate the speech quality, mel-ceptral distortion (MCD), logspectral distortion (LSD), and non-intrusive speech quality metric Deep Noise Suppression Mean Opinion Score (DNSMOS) [37] were adopted. The WORLD vocoder [38] was utilized to extract $F_{0}$ , $U\\/V$ fags, and mel-cepstral coeffcients (mcep). A public DNSMOS3 model was adopted. The inputs of the DNSMOS model were downsampled to $16\\\\:\\\\mathrm{kHz}$ to match the model, and the SIG raw scores (for evaluating clean speech) are reported.\\n\\nAs shown in Table 1, the performance differences between symAD and SS show the effectiveness of the MPDs. The even worse results of the symAD w\\/o the proposed training paradigm $\\\\mathrm{(symAD^{*})}$ ) demonstrate that the GAN training is more related to improving the decoder. The worst results of asymAD yield the diffculties of training an asymmetric AE. Furthermore, the proposed vocoder-based codecs (AudioDec $\\\\mathbf{V}^{*}$ ) achieve the best performance of all measurements, and the group convolution networks work as well as the MRF network showing that the ad hoc kernel sizes are unnecessary. In conclusion, training a powerful vocoder with the globally normalized codes extracted from a well-trained audio encoder is a effcient and trackable way to build a neural codec.\",\"paper_id\":\"f03c7d74-1e5d-5288-8cdb-5ce2c5eec686\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
