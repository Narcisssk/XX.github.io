{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Its primary func-\\ntion is to maintain quality standards for academic\\npublications and provide authors with constructive\\nfeedback on their work. Its effectiveness is cur-\\nrently being challenged by a significant surge in the\\nnumber of submissions. Conferences in computer\\nscience, such as the International Conference on\\nLearning Representations (ICLR) and the Associa-\\ntion for Computational Linguistics (ACL), among\\nothers, regularly receive thousands of submissions.\\n*Equal contribution.\\nFor instance, the number of submissions to ICLR\\nand ACL has increased fivefold since 2017, reach-\\ning 3407 and 3378 submissions, respectively, in\\n2022.\\nThe reviewing process is inherently a tool for sci-\\nentific communication with at least two target audi-\\nences: the authors of a paper and the area chair. The\\nformer should get feedback on their work, whereas\\nthe latter has to synthesize the salient points from\\nall the reviews as part of their decision process.\\nThe area chair has to extract from the reviews the\\noverall sentiment about the paper while gathering\\nthe common ideas and unique arguments raised by\\nthe reviewers. An efficient highlighting mechanism\\ncould help area chairs in their decision-making pro-\\ncess, thus reducing their workload.\\nSeveral methods have been developed to gen-\\nerate summaries from reviews in various do-\\nmains (Bra\\u017einskas et al., 2020; Chu and Liu, 2019).\\nMany of these methods identify salient segments in\\nreviews based on the discussed topics and the senti-\\nment polarity (Zhao and Chaturvedi, 2020; Li et al.,\\n2023a; Amplayo et al., 2021a), or using centrality-\\nbased metrics (Ge et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2021).\\nHowever, these techniques fall short in the peer re-\\nview domain. Indeed, they are designed to generate\\na consensus opinion summary, reflecting common\\nopinions without identifying divergent and unique\\nones. This poses a challenge for the peer review\\ndomain since area chairs are concerned with both\\ncommon and divergent opinions among reviewers.\\nIn this paper, we recognize one of the underly-\\ning communication goals in the reviewing\\/meta-\\nreviewing process: to convey the review\\u2019s main\\npoints to the area chair concisely. The distillation\\nof such salient information in a concise message\\nhas been a long-standing focus of study within the\\npragmatics domain. One of the most influential\\nprobabilistic approaches to pragmatics is the Ratio-\\nnal Speech Act (RSA). It formulates the communi-\\ncation problem akin to a \\\"reference game\\\", with the\\n12737\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"goal of associating each item in a set with the most\\ninformative yet concise utterance that distinguishes\\nit from others.\\nWe take inspiration from this reference-game\\nscenario to introduce the discriminative summariza-\\ntion task. The goal is to generate a summary for\\neach review that highlights commonalities, differ-\\nences, and unique perspectives, thereby distinguish-\\ning one review from others of the same submission.\\nThis framework closely aligns with the challenge of\\nsummarizing academic reviews, distilling key dis-\\ncriminative insights from lengthy reviews, thus con-\\ntextualizing each review in relation to others. To\\nthis end, we map the discriminative summarization\\ntask to a reference game and propose GLIMPSE, a\\nnovel pragmatically informative summarization\\nmethod for scholarly reviews. At the technical\\nlevel, we leverage the RSA model, a framework for\\npragmatic modeling rooted in Bayesian inference\\nthat solves the reference game setting (Frank and\\nGoodman, 2012). We define two novel RSA-based\\nscores that measure the informativeness and the\\nuniqueness of opinions in scholarly reviews. We\\nuse these scores to rank utterances describing a re-\\nview and aggregate them to compose a \\u201cglimpse\\u201d\\nof all reviews.\\nWe conducted extensive experiments on a real-\\nworld peer review dataset from the ICLR confer-\\nence collected over a four-year time period. We\\ncompare GLIMPSE performance to state-of-the-art\\nmethods in multi-document summarization. We\\ndesign extractive and abstractive variants of our\\nframework and shed light on their properties. Our\\nresults show that GLIMPSE generates informative\\nand concise summaries. To the best of our knowl-\\nedge, we are the first to cast the multi-document\\nsummarization problem as a reference game and\\nadopt RSA to identify common and divergent opin-\\nions in reviews.\\nContributions: Overall, we make the following\\nkey contributions:\\n1. We propose a new setting for multi-document\\nsummarization: discriminative summarization\\nand cast it as a reference game problem.\\n2. We propose new informativeness and unique-\\nness scores for multi-document summariza-\\ntion based on the RSA model of human com-\\nmunication.\\n3. We conduct empirical evaluation to demon-\\nstrate that we extract more discriminative sum-\\nmaries than consensus-based summarizers in\\nboth automatic and human evaluation.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nUnsupervised Opinion Summarization.\\nOur\\nwork is related to unsupervised opinion summariza-\\ntion, where several methods have been developed\\nto summarize reviews of products or hotels. These\\nmethods can be divided into two categories: ab-\\nstractive and extractive. Abstractive summarization\\naims to generate a coherent summary that reflects\\nsalient opinions in input reviews. For instance,\\nMeanSum (Chu and Liu, 2019) relies on an auto-\\nencoder architecture, in which an aggregated rep-\\nresentation of the input reviews is fed to a decoder\\nthat generates review-like summaries. Another ap-\\nproach consists of using a hierarchical variational\\nautoencoder model (Bra\\u017einskas et al., 2020) to gen-\\nerate summaries that represent dominant opinions\\nwithin reviews. Other methods rely on modeling\\nfine-grained information within reviews. This in-\\ncludes disentangling aspects and sentiments (Am-\\nplayo et al., 2021b; Wang and Wan, 2021; Suhara\\net al., 2020; Ke et al., 2022), topics (Xu and Lapata,\\n2020) and contrastive opinions (Iso et al., 2022;\\nCarenini and Cheung, 2008). The absence of at-\\ntributability in these methods presents a challenge\\nin the peer review domain due to the need for trans-\\nparency and context. In the peer review process,\\narea chairs might seek to trace the source of the\\nsynthesized opinions to assess their validity and\\nrelevance. Our method addresses the challenge\\nof attributability by associating a summary with\\neach review, ensuring transparency and allowing\\narea chairs to trace and understand the synthesized\\nopinions in context.\\nIn contrast to abstractive summarization, which\\nentails generating new text, extractive summariza-\\ntion aims to extract significant phrases directly\\nfrom the input reviews. A fundamental method\\nin extractive summarization involves clustering re-\\nview segments and iteratively extracting the central\\nelements of these segments to form a summary.\\nVarious techniques depend on a model to acquire\\nrepresentations for review sentences. These rep-\\nresentations are then utilized by an inference al-\\ngorithm, often in an encoder-decoder architecture,\\nto choose sentences for summarization (Li et al.,\\n2023a; Amplayo et al., 2021a; Angelidis et al.,\\n2021; Gu et al., 2022; Angelidis and Lapata, 2018).\\nCurrent extractive methods concentrate on amal-\\ngamating common opinions found across reviews.\\nHowever, we contend that such common opinions\\nhold less significance in scholarly contexts.

Var-\\nious strategies have been developed for this task.\\nFor instance, MetaGen (Bhatia et al., 2020) gener-\\nates an extractive summary draft of reviews, then\\nuses a fine-tuned model for decision prediction,\\nand generates an abstractive meta-review based on\\nboth the draft and the predicted decision. Simi-\\nlarly, (Li et al., 2023b) leverage the hierarchical\\nrelationships within reviews and metadata, such\\nas reviewers\\u2019 confidence and rating, to generate a\\nmeta-review along with the acceptance decision.\\nRecently, (Zeng et al., 2023) proposed to prompt\\na large language model in a guided and iterative\\nmanner to generate a meta-review. Our task is dif-\\nferent because our goal is to support area chairs by\\ngenerating a summary of reviewers\\u2019 opinions and\\nhighlighting areas of divergence. Predicting the\\nmeta-reviewer\\u2019s decision and generating a meta-\\nreview based on the predicted decision is out of the\\nscope of our work as we believe it is not desirable\\nto do so. The metareview evaluation should ulti-\\nmately remain in the hands of a human expert as\\nit involves scientific expertise and reasoning about\\nthe evaluated paper.\\nRational Speech Act (RSA) framework. The\\nRational Speech Act theory (Frank and Goodman,\\n2012) is the most influential probabilistic approach\\nto pragmatics (Qing and Franke, 2015; Degen,\\n2023). It formulates communication between a\\npragmatic speaker and a listener as probabilistic\\nreasoning, where the speaker\\u2019s goal is to choose\\nthe utterance that is both short and informative with\\nrespect to the speaker\\u2019s intended referent (Degen,\\n2023). As a result, the RSA framework aims to\\neffectively identify the most informative utterance\\nfrom multiple potential options in a given context.\\nIt has been applied to various tasks, including im-\\nage captioning (Ou et al., 2023; Cohn-Gordon et al.,\\n2018), translation (Cohn-Gordon and Goodman,\\n2019), dialogue (Kim et al., 2020, 2021), and text\\ngeneration (Shen et al., 2019), among others. How-\\never, there is little research on applying the RSA\\nframework to multi-document summarization. In\\nour study, we tailor the RSA framework for multi-\\ndocument summarization tasks, aiming to produce\\nsummaries that capture various perspectives while\\nminimizing redundancy.\\n3\\nDiscriminative Multi-Document\\nSummarization (D-MDS)\\nMost approaches to multi-document summariza-\\ntion prioritize generating consensus-based sum-\\nmaries by emphasizing redundant opinions across\\nreviews. However, in domains like peer review,\\nwhere including unique and divergent opinions is\\ncrucial for a comprehensive summary, the conven-\\ntional focus on common opinions becomes less rele-\\nvant. This shift in emphasis is particularly pertinent\\nin scholarly review summarization, where the ob-\\njective is to convey the various opinions and distinc-\\ntive viewpoints expressed by reviewers. With this\\nobjective in mind, we introduce the discriminative\\n12739\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"multi-document summarization task, inspired by\\nthe reference game setting. Our aim is to furnish\\nthe meta-reviewer with a summary for each re-\\nview, enabling them to swiftly identify the source\\nreview based on the summary content.\\nFormally, we define the discriminative multi-\\ndocument summarization problem as follows:\\nDefinition 1 (The discriminative multi-document\\nsummarization problem). Let N = {d1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , dN}\\nbe a set of documents. For each document di, we\\nsuppose we have K candidate summaries and we\\nform K = {si,j}1\\u2a7di\\u2a7dN,1\\u2a7dj\\u2a7dK the set of all candi-\\ndates. The goal is to select the most informative\\nsummary from that set for each document di \\u2208N\\nThese candidates can be generated using various\\nsummarization methods (see Sec. 5.1).\\n4\\nProblem Formulation and Pragmatic\\nSummarization\\nIn this section, we formulate the discriminative\\nmulti-document summarization problem as a ref-\\nerence game. We then apply the Rational Speech\\nAct (RSA) framework, a probabilistic approach to\\npragmatics that tackles reference games, to address\\nthis summarization problem.\\n4.1\\nD-MDS Problem as a Reference Game\\nIn a reference game setting (Frank and Goodman,\\n2012), a speaker and a listener are given a set of\\nobjects. The speaker provides a description of a tar-\\nget among the set of objects, and a listener aims to\\nselect the correct target given the speaker\\u2019s descrip-\\ntion. The speaker\\u2019s goal is to describe the target\\nusing one of its properties in an informative yet\\nconcise manner. Similarly, in discriminative multi-\\ndocument summarization, our goal is to develop a\\nsummarizer that provides a concise yet informative\\ndescription of each review within a set of reviews.\\nGiven this similarity, we formally map the D-MDS\\nproblem to a reference game setting as follows.\\nDefinition 2 (D-MDS as a reference game). Let\\nO \\u225c{d1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , dN} be the set of documents and\\nC \\u225c{si,j}1\\u2a7di\\u2a7dN,1\\u2a7dj\\u2a7dK the set of candidate sum-\\nmaries. Let M : O \\u00d7 C \\u2192[0, 1] be a truth matrix\\nthat indicates the likelihood of a candidate sum-\\nmary s being a summary of a document d.

Its primary func-\\ntion is to maintain quality standards for academic\\npublications and provide authors with constructive\\nfeedback on their work. Its effectiveness is cur-\\nrently being challenged by a significant surge in the\\nnumber of submissions. Conferences in computer\\nscience, such as the International Conference on\\nLearning Representations (ICLR) and the Associa-\\ntion for Computational Linguistics (ACL), among\\nothers, regularly receive thousands of submissions.\\n*Equal contribution.\\nFor instance, the number of submissions to ICLR\\nand ACL has increased fivefold since 2017, reach-\\ning 3407 and 3378 submissions, respectively, in\\n2022.\\nThe reviewing process is inherently a tool for sci-\\nentific communication with at least two target audi-\\nences: the authors of a paper and the area chair. The\\nformer should get feedback on their work, whereas\\nthe latter has to synthesize the salient points from\\nall the reviews as part of their decision process.\\nThe area chair has to extract from the reviews the\\noverall sentiment about the paper while gathering\\nthe common ideas and unique arguments raised by\\nthe reviewers. An efficient highlighting mechanism\\ncould help area chairs in their decision-making pro-\\ncess, thus reducing their workload.\\nSeveral methods have been developed to gen-\\nerate summaries from reviews in various do-\\nmains (Bra\\u017einskas et al., 2020; Chu and Liu, 2019).\\nMany of these methods identify salient segments in\\nreviews based on the discussed topics and the senti-\\nment polarity (Zhao and Chaturvedi, 2020; Li et al.,\\n2023a; Amplayo et al., 2021a), or using centrality-\\nbased metrics (Ge et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2021).\\nHowever, these techniques fall short in the peer re-\\nview domain. Indeed, they are designed to generate\\na consensus opinion summary, reflecting common\\nopinions without identifying divergent and unique\\nones. This poses a challenge for the peer review\\ndomain since area chairs are concerned with both\\ncommon and divergent opinions among reviewers.\\nIn this paper, we recognize one of the underly-\\ning communication goals in the reviewing\\/meta-\\nreviewing process: to convey the review\\u2019s main\\npoints to the area chair concisely. The distillation\\nof such salient information in a concise message\\nhas been a long-standing focus of study within the\\npragmatics domain. One of the most influential\\nprobabilistic approaches to pragmatics is the Ratio-\\nnal Speech Act (RSA). It formulates the communi-\\ncation problem akin to a \\\"reference game\\\", with the\\n12737\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"goal of associating each item in a set with the most\\ninformative yet concise utterance that distinguishes\\nit from others.\\nWe take inspiration from this reference-game\\nscenario to introduce the discriminative summariza-\\ntion task. The goal is to generate a summary for\\neach review that highlights commonalities, differ-\\nences, and unique perspectives, thereby distinguish-\\ning one review from others of the same submission.\\nThis framework closely aligns with the challenge of\\nsummarizing academic reviews, distilling key dis-\\ncriminative insights from lengthy reviews, thus con-\\ntextualizing each review in relation to others. To\\nthis end, we map the discriminative summarization\\ntask to a reference game and propose GLIMPSE, a\\nnovel pragmatically informative summarization\\nmethod for scholarly reviews. At the technical\\nlevel, we leverage the RSA model, a framework for\\npragmatic modeling rooted in Bayesian inference\\nthat solves the reference game setting (Frank and\\nGoodman, 2012). We define two novel RSA-based\\nscores that measure the informativeness and the\\nuniqueness of opinions in scholarly reviews. We\\nuse these scores to rank utterances describing a re-\\nview and aggregate them to compose a \\u201cglimpse\\u201d\\nof all reviews.\\nWe conducted extensive experiments on a real-\\nworld peer review dataset from the ICLR confer-\\nence collected over a four-year time period. We\\ncompare GLIMPSE performance to state-of-the-art\\nmethods in multi-document summarization. We\\ndesign extractive and abstractive variants of our\\nframework and shed light on their properties. Our\\nresults show that GLIMPSE generates informative\\nand concise summaries. To the best of our knowl-\\nedge, we are the first to cast the multi-document\\nsummarization problem as a reference game and\\nadopt RSA to identify common and divergent opin-\\nions in reviews.\\nContributions: Overall, we make the following\\nkey contributions:\\n1. We propose a new setting for multi-document\\nsummarization: discriminative summarization\\nand cast it as a reference game problem.\\n2. We propose new informativeness and unique-\\nness scores for multi-document summariza-\\ntion based on the RSA model of human com-\\nmunication.\\n3. We conduct empirical evaluation to demon-\\nstrate that we extract more discriminative sum-\\nmaries than consensus-based summarizers in\\nboth automatic and human evaluation.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nUnsupervised Opinion Summarization.\\nOur\\nwork is related to unsupervised opinion summariza-\\ntion, where several methods have been developed\\nto summarize reviews of products or hotels. These\\nmethods can be divided into two categories: ab-\\nstractive and extractive. Abstractive summarization\\naims to generate a coherent summary that reflects\\nsalient opinions in input reviews. For instance,\\nMeanSum (Chu and Liu, 2019) relies on an auto-\\nencoder architecture, in which an aggregated rep-\\nresentation of the input reviews is fed to a decoder\\nthat generates review-like summaries. Another ap-\\nproach consists of using a hierarchical variational\\nautoencoder model (Bra\\u017einskas et al., 2020) to gen-\\nerate summaries that represent dominant opinions\\nwithin reviews. Other methods rely on modeling\\nfine-grained information within reviews. This in-\\ncludes disentangling aspects and sentiments (Am-\\nplayo et al., 2021b; Wang and Wan, 2021; Suhara\\net al., 2020; Ke et al., 2022), topics (Xu and Lapata,\\n2020) and contrastive opinions (Iso et al., 2022;\\nCarenini and Cheung, 2008). The absence of at-\\ntributability in these methods presents a challenge\\nin the peer review domain due to the need for trans-\\nparency and context. In the peer review process,\\narea chairs might seek to trace the source of the\\nsynthesized opinions to assess their validity and\\nrelevance. Our method addresses the challenge\\nof attributability by associating a summary with\\neach review, ensuring transparency and allowing\\narea chairs to trace and understand the synthesized\\nopinions in context.\\nIn contrast to abstractive summarization, which\\nentails generating new text, extractive summariza-\\ntion aims to extract significant phrases directly\\nfrom the input reviews. A fundamental method\\nin extractive summarization involves clustering re-\\nview segments and iteratively extracting the central\\nelements of these segments to form a summary.\\nVarious techniques depend on a model to acquire\\nrepresentations for review sentences. These rep-\\nresentations are then utilized by an inference al-\\ngorithm, often in an encoder-decoder architecture,\\nto choose sentences for summarization (Li et al.,\\n2023a; Amplayo et al., 2021a; Angelidis et al.,\\n2021; Gu et al., 2022; Angelidis and Lapata, 2018).\\nCurrent extractive methods concentrate on amal-\\ngamating common opinions found across reviews.\\nHowever, we contend that such common opinions\\nhold less significance in scholarly contexts.

Var-\\nious strategies have been developed for this task.\\nFor instance, MetaGen (Bhatia et al., 2020) gener-\\nates an extractive summary draft of reviews, then\\nuses a fine-tuned model for decision prediction,\\nand generates an abstractive meta-review based on\\nboth the draft and the predicted decision. Simi-\\nlarly, (Li et al., 2023b) leverage the hierarchical\\nrelationships within reviews and metadata, such\\nas reviewers\\u2019 confidence and rating, to generate a\\nmeta-review along with the acceptance decision.\\nRecently, (Zeng et al., 2023) proposed to prompt\\na large language model in a guided and iterative\\nmanner to generate a meta-review. Our task is dif-\\nferent because our goal is to support area chairs by\\ngenerating a summary of reviewers\\u2019 opinions and\\nhighlighting areas of divergence. Predicting the\\nmeta-reviewer\\u2019s decision and generating a meta-\\nreview based on the predicted decision is out of the\\nscope of our work as we believe it is not desirable\\nto do so. The metareview evaluation should ulti-\\nmately remain in the hands of a human expert as\\nit involves scientific expertise and reasoning about\\nthe evaluated paper.\\nRational Speech Act (RSA) framework. The\\nRational Speech Act theory (Frank and Goodman,\\n2012) is the most influential probabilistic approach\\nto pragmatics (Qing and Franke, 2015; Degen,\\n2023). It formulates communication between a\\npragmatic speaker and a listener as probabilistic\\nreasoning, where the speaker\\u2019s goal is to choose\\nthe utterance that is both short and informative with\\nrespect to the speaker\\u2019s intended referent (Degen,\\n2023). As a result, the RSA framework aims to\\neffectively identify the most informative utterance\\nfrom multiple potential options in a given context.\\nIt has been applied to various tasks, including im-\\nage captioning (Ou et al., 2023; Cohn-Gordon et al.,\\n2018), translation (Cohn-Gordon and Goodman,\\n2019), dialogue (Kim et al., 2020, 2021), and text\\ngeneration (Shen et al., 2019), among others. How-\\never, there is little research on applying the RSA\\nframework to multi-document summarization. In\\nour study, we tailor the RSA framework for multi-\\ndocument summarization tasks, aiming to produce\\nsummaries that capture various perspectives while\\nminimizing redundancy.\\n3\\nDiscriminative Multi-Document\\nSummarization (D-MDS)\\nMost approaches to multi-document summariza-\\ntion prioritize generating consensus-based sum-\\nmaries by emphasizing redundant opinions across\\nreviews. However, in domains like peer review,\\nwhere including unique and divergent opinions is\\ncrucial for a comprehensive summary, the conven-\\ntional focus on common opinions becomes less rele-\\nvant. This shift in emphasis is particularly pertinent\\nin scholarly review summarization, where the ob-\\njective is to convey the various opinions and distinc-\\ntive viewpoints expressed by reviewers. With this\\nobjective in mind, we introduce the discriminative\\n12739\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"multi-document summarization task, inspired by\\nthe reference game setting. Our aim is to furnish\\nthe meta-reviewer with a summary for each re-\\nview, enabling them to swiftly identify the source\\nreview based on the summary content.\\nFormally, we define the discriminative multi-\\ndocument summarization problem as follows:\\nDefinition 1 (The discriminative multi-document\\nsummarization problem). Let N = {d1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , dN}\\nbe a set of documents. For each document di, we\\nsuppose we have K candidate summaries and we\\nform K = {si,j}1\\u2a7di\\u2a7dN,1\\u2a7dj\\u2a7dK the set of all candi-\\ndates. The goal is to select the most informative\\nsummary from that set for each document di \\u2208N\\nThese candidates can be generated using various\\nsummarization methods (see Sec. 5.1).\\n4\\nProblem Formulation and Pragmatic\\nSummarization\\nIn this section, we formulate the discriminative\\nmulti-document summarization problem as a ref-\\nerence game. We then apply the Rational Speech\\nAct (RSA) framework, a probabilistic approach to\\npragmatics that tackles reference games, to address\\nthis summarization problem.\\n4.1\\nD-MDS Problem as a Reference Game\\nIn a reference game setting (Frank and Goodman,\\n2012), a speaker and a listener are given a set of\\nobjects. The speaker provides a description of a tar-\\nget among the set of objects, and a listener aims to\\nselect the correct target given the speaker\\u2019s descrip-\\ntion. The speaker\\u2019s goal is to describe the target\\nusing one of its properties in an informative yet\\nconcise manner. Similarly, in discriminative multi-\\ndocument summarization, our goal is to develop a\\nsummarizer that provides a concise yet informative\\ndescription of each review within a set of reviews.\\nGiven this similarity, we formally map the D-MDS\\nproblem to a reference game setting as follows.\\nDefinition 2 (D-MDS as a reference game). Let\\nO \\u225c{d1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , dN} be the set of documents and\\nC \\u225c{si,j}1\\u2a7di\\u2a7dN,1\\u2a7dj\\u2a7dK the set of candidate sum-\\nmaries. Let M : O \\u00d7 C \\u2192[0, 1] be a truth matrix\\nthat indicates the likelihood of a candidate sum-\\nmary s being a summary of a document d. In stan-\\ndard reference games, the truth-matrix is boolean as\\nthe properties for an object are either true or false.\\nIn our setting, we approximate the truth-matrix\\nusing a pre-trained language model on summariza-\\ntion LM to score the likelihood of each candidate\\nsummary s to be associated with a document d:\\nM(t, s) \\u2248LM(s|d).\\n4.2\\nThe Pragmatic Summarizer\\nOne popular framework to efficiently tackle ref-\\nerence games is the Rational Speech Act (RSA)\\nmodel of human communication Frank and Good-\\nman (2012), which models optimal communication\\nbetween pragmatic agents and provides a formal\\nframework to build pragmatic speakers and listen-\\ners. Therefore, we propose two novel RSA-based\\nscores to select informative and unique opinions for\\nreview summarization, which we discuss in detail\\nin Sec. 5.2. In what follows, we present how we\\nadapt RSA to our summarization setting.\\nThe RSA framework posits that both the speaker\\nand listener maximize the utility of their commu-\\nnication and they both assume the other is rational.\\nThey iteratively adapt to each other to reach a com-\\nmon understanding of the context. Formally, we\\ndefine the utility of communicating to a listener L,\\nthe summary s for a document d as:\\nVL(s, d) = log L(d|s) \\u2212Cost(d),\\n(1)\\nwhere L(d|s) denotes the conditional probability\\nof guessing the object d \\u2014 the document\\/review in\\nour case \\u2014 upon receiving s \\u2014 a short summary\\u2014\\naccording to the listener L, Cost(s) is the cost of\\ntransmitting the summary s. In most cases, the\\ncost is assumed to be 0, and we measure the infor-\\nmativeness, which is defined with the conditional\\nprobability L(d|s).\\nPragmatic reasoning is modeled as an iterative\\nprocess that starts from a literal listener, i.e. a\\nlistener who has no assumption about the speaker.\\nWe denote it with L0(d|s) and define it using a\\npre-trained language model LM:\\nDefinition 3 (Literal listener).\\nL0(d|s) =\\nLM(s|d)\\nP\\nd\\u2208O LM(s|d).\\n(2)\\nThe pragmatic speaker adapts to a listener under\\nthe cost constraint by maximizing the communica-\\ntion utility (Zaslavsky et al., 2021).

In this paper, we introduce GLIMPSE, a\\nsummarization method designed to offer a con-\\ncise yet comprehensive overview of scholarly\\nreviews. Unlike traditional consensus-based\\nmethods, GLIMPSE extracts both common and\\nunique opinions from the reviews. We intro-\\nduce novel uniqueness scores based on the Ra-\\ntional Speech Act framework to identify rel-\\nevant sentences in the reviews. Our method\\naims to provide a pragmatic glimpse into all re-\\nviews, offering a balanced perspective on their\\nopinions. Our experimental results with both\\nautomatic metrics and human evaluation show\\nthat GLIMPSE generates more discriminative\\nsummaries than baseline methods in terms of\\nhuman evaluation while achieving comparable\\nperformance with these methods in terms of\\nautomatic metrics.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nPeer review is the standard process for evaluating\\nresearchers\\u2019 work submitted to conferences or aca-\\ndemic journals across all fields. Its primary func-\\ntion is to maintain quality standards for academic\\npublications and provide authors with constructive\\nfeedback on their work. Its effectiveness is cur-\\nrently being challenged by a significant surge in the\\nnumber of submissions. Conferences in computer\\nscience, such as the International Conference on\\nLearning Representations (ICLR) and the Associa-\\ntion for Computational Linguistics (ACL), among\\nothers, regularly receive thousands of submissions.\\n*Equal contribution.\\nFor instance, the number of submissions to ICLR\\nand ACL has increased fivefold since 2017, reach-\\ning 3407 and 3378 submissions, respectively, in\\n2022.\\nThe reviewing process is inherently a tool for sci-\\nentific communication with at least two target audi-\\nences: the authors of a paper and the area chair. The\\nformer should get feedback on their work, whereas\\nthe latter has to synthesize the salient points from\\nall the reviews as part of their decision process.\\nThe area chair has to extract from the reviews the\\noverall sentiment about the paper while gathering\\nthe common ideas and unique arguments raised by\\nthe reviewers. An efficient highlighting mechanism\\ncould help area chairs in their decision-making pro-\\ncess, thus reducing their workload.\\nSeveral methods have been developed to gen-\\nerate summaries from reviews in various do-\\nmains (Bra\\u017einskas et al., 2020; Chu and Liu, 2019).\\nMany of these methods identify salient segments in\\nreviews based on the discussed topics and the senti-\\nment polarity (Zhao and Chaturvedi, 2020; Li et al.,\\n2023a; Amplayo et al., 2021a), or using centrality-\\nbased metrics (Ge et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2021).\\nHowever, these techniques fall short in the peer re-\\nview domain. Indeed, they are designed to generate\\na consensus opinion summary, reflecting common\\nopinions without identifying divergent and unique\\nones. This poses a challenge for the peer review\\ndomain since area chairs are concerned with both\\ncommon and divergent opinions among reviewers.\\nIn this paper, we recognize one of the underly-\\ning communication goals in the reviewing\\/meta-\\nreviewing process: to convey the review\\u2019s main\\npoints to the area chair concisely. The distillation\\nof such salient information in a concise message\\nhas been a long-standing focus of study within the\\npragmatics domain. One of the most influential\\nprobabilistic approaches to pragmatics is the Ratio-\\nnal Speech Act (RSA). It formulates the communi-\\ncation problem akin to a \\\"reference game\\\", with the\\n12737\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"goal of associating each item in a set with the most\\ninformative yet concise utterance that distinguishes\\nit from others.\\nWe take inspiration from this reference-game\\nscenario to introduce the discriminative summariza-\\ntion task. The goal is to generate a summary for\\neach review that highlights commonalities, differ-\\nences, and unique perspectives, thereby distinguish-\\ning one review from others of the same submission.\\nThis framework closely aligns with the challenge of\\nsummarizing academic reviews, distilling key dis-\\ncriminative insights from lengthy reviews, thus con-\\ntextualizing each review in relation to others. To\\nthis end, we map the discriminative summarization\\ntask to a reference game and propose GLIMPSE, a\\nnovel pragmatically informative summarization\\nmethod for scholarly reviews. At the technical\\nlevel, we leverage the RSA model, a framework for\\npragmatic modeling rooted in Bayesian inference\\nthat solves the reference game setting (Frank and\\nGoodman, 2012). We define two novel RSA-based\\nscores that measure the informativeness and the\\nuniqueness of opinions in scholarly reviews. We\\nuse these scores to rank utterances describing a re-\\nview and aggregate them to compose a \\u201cglimpse\\u201d\\nof all reviews.\\nWe conducted extensive experiments on a real-\\nworld peer review dataset from the ICLR confer-\\nence collected over a four-year time period. We\\ncompare GLIMPSE performance to state-of-the-art\\nmethods in multi-document summarization. We\\ndesign extractive and abstractive variants of our\\nframework and shed light on their properties. Our\\nresults show that GLIMPSE generates informative\\nand concise summaries. To the best of our knowl-\\nedge, we are the first to cast the multi-document\\nsummarization problem as a reference game and\\nadopt RSA to identify common and divergent opin-\\nions in reviews.\\nContributions: Overall, we make the following\\nkey contributions:\\n1. We propose a new setting for multi-document\\nsummarization: discriminative summarization\\nand cast it as a reference game problem.\\n2. We propose new informativeness and unique-\\nness scores for multi-document summariza-\\ntion based on the RSA model of human com-\\nmunication.\\n3. We conduct empirical evaluation to demon-\\nstrate that we extract more discriminative sum-\\nmaries than consensus-based summarizers in\\nboth automatic and human evaluation.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nUnsupervised Opinion Summarization.\\nOur\\nwork is related to unsupervised opinion summariza-\\ntion, where several methods have been developed\\nto summarize reviews of products or hotels. These\\nmethods can be divided into two categories: ab-\\nstractive and extractive. Abstractive summarization\\naims to generate a coherent summary that reflects\\nsalient opinions in input reviews. For instance,\\nMeanSum (Chu and Liu, 2019) relies on an auto-\\nencoder architecture, in which an aggregated rep-\\nresentation of the input reviews is fed to a decoder\\nthat generates review-like summaries. Another ap-\\nproach consists of using a hierarchical variational\\nautoencoder model (Bra\\u017einskas et al., 2020) to gen-\\nerate summaries that represent dominant opinions\\nwithin reviews. Other methods rely on modeling\\nfine-grained information within reviews. This in-\\ncludes disentangling aspects and sentiments (Am-\\nplayo et al., 2021b; Wang and Wan, 2021; Suhara\\net al., 2020; Ke et al., 2022), topics (Xu and Lapata,\\n2020) and contrastive opinions (Iso et al., 2022;\\nCarenini and Cheung, 2008). The absence of at-\\ntributability in these methods presents a challenge\\nin the peer review domain due to the need for trans-\\nparency and context. In the peer review process,\\narea chairs might seek to trace the source of the\\nsynthesized opinions to assess their validity and\\nrelevance. Our method addresses the challenge\\nof attributability by associating a summary with\\neach review, ensuring transparency and allowing\\narea chairs to trace and understand the synthesized\\nopinions in context.\\nIn contrast to abstractive summarization, which\\nentails generating new text, extractive summariza-\\ntion aims to extract significant phrases directly\\nfrom the input reviews. A fundamental method\\nin extractive summarization involves clustering re-\\nview segments and iteratively extracting the central\\nelements of these segments to form a summary.\\nVarious techniques depend on a model to acquire\\nrepresentations for review sentences. These rep-\\nresentations are then utilized by an inference al-\\ngorithm, often in an encoder-decoder architecture,\\nto choose sentences for summarization (Li et al.,\\n2023a; Amplayo et al., 2021a; Angelidis et al.,\\n2021; Gu et al., 2022; Angelidis and Lapata, 2018).\\nCurrent extractive methods concentrate on amal-\\ngamating common opinions found across reviews.\\nHowever, we contend that such common opinions\\nhold less significance in scholarly contexts.

Var-\\nious strategies have been developed for this task.\\nFor instance, MetaGen (Bhatia et al., 2020) gener-\\nates an extractive summary draft of reviews, then\\nuses a fine-tuned model for decision prediction,\\nand generates an abstractive meta-review based on\\nboth the draft and the predicted decision. Simi-\\nlarly, (Li et al., 2023b) leverage the hierarchical\\nrelationships within reviews and metadata, such\\nas reviewers\\u2019 confidence and rating, to generate a\\nmeta-review along with the acceptance decision.\\nRecently, (Zeng et al., 2023) proposed to prompt\\na large language model in a guided and iterative\\nmanner to generate a meta-review. Our task is dif-\\nferent because our goal is to support area chairs by\\ngenerating a summary of reviewers\\u2019 opinions and\\nhighlighting areas of divergence. Predicting the\\nmeta-reviewer\\u2019s decision and generating a meta-\\nreview based on the predicted decision is out of the\\nscope of our work as we believe it is not desirable\\nto do so. The metareview evaluation should ulti-\\nmately remain in the hands of a human expert as\\nit involves scientific expertise and reasoning about\\nthe evaluated paper.\\nRational Speech Act (RSA) framework. The\\nRational Speech Act theory (Frank and Goodman,\\n2012) is the most influential probabilistic approach\\nto pragmatics (Qing and Franke, 2015; Degen,\\n2023). It formulates communication between a\\npragmatic speaker and a listener as probabilistic\\nreasoning, where the speaker\\u2019s goal is to choose\\nthe utterance that is both short and informative with\\nrespect to the speaker\\u2019s intended referent (Degen,\\n2023). As a result, the RSA framework aims to\\neffectively identify the most informative utterance\\nfrom multiple potential options in a given context.\\nIt has been applied to various tasks, including im-\\nage captioning (Ou et al., 2023; Cohn-Gordon et al.,\\n2018), translation (Cohn-Gordon and Goodman,\\n2019), dialogue (Kim et al., 2020, 2021), and text\\ngeneration (Shen et al., 2019), among others. How-\\never, there is little research on applying the RSA\\nframework to multi-document summarization. In\\nour study, we tailor the RSA framework for multi-\\ndocument summarization tasks, aiming to produce\\nsummaries that capture various perspectives while\\nminimizing redundancy.\\n3\\nDiscriminative Multi-Document\\nSummarization (D-MDS)\\nMost approaches to multi-document summariza-\\ntion prioritize generating consensus-based sum-\\nmaries by emphasizing redundant opinions across\\nreviews. However, in domains like peer review,\\nwhere including unique and divergent opinions is\\ncrucial for a comprehensive summary, the conven-\\ntional focus on common opinions becomes less rele-\\nvant. This shift in emphasis is particularly pertinent\\nin scholarly review summarization, where the ob-\\njective is to convey the various opinions and distinc-\\ntive viewpoints expressed by reviewers. With this\\nobjective in mind, we introduce the discriminative\\n12739\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"multi-document summarization task, inspired by\\nthe reference game setting. Our aim is to furnish\\nthe meta-reviewer with a summary for each re-\\nview, enabling them to swiftly identify the source\\nreview based on the summary content.\\nFormally, we define the discriminative multi-\\ndocument summarization problem as follows:\\nDefinition 1 (The discriminative multi-document\\nsummarization problem). Let N = {d1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , dN}\\nbe a set of documents. For each document di, we\\nsuppose we have K candidate summaries and we\\nform K = {si,j}1\\u2a7di\\u2a7dN,1\\u2a7dj\\u2a7dK the set of all candi-\\ndates. The goal is to select the most informative\\nsummary from that set for each document di \\u2208N\\nThese candidates can be generated using various\\nsummarization methods (see Sec. 5.1).\\n4\\nProblem Formulation and Pragmatic\\nSummarization\\nIn this section, we formulate the discriminative\\nmulti-document summarization problem as a ref-\\nerence game. We then apply the Rational Speech\\nAct (RSA) framework, a probabilistic approach to\\npragmatics that tackles reference games, to address\\nthis summarization problem.\\n4.1\\nD-MDS Problem as a Reference Game\\nIn a reference game setting (Frank and Goodman,\\n2012), a speaker and a listener are given a set of\\nobjects. The speaker provides a description of a tar-\\nget among the set of objects, and a listener aims to\\nselect the correct target given the speaker\\u2019s descrip-\\ntion. The speaker\\u2019s goal is to describe the target\\nusing one of its properties in an informative yet\\nconcise manner. Similarly, in discriminative multi-\\ndocument summarization, our goal is to develop a\\nsummarizer that provides a concise yet informative\\ndescription of each review within a set of reviews.\\nGiven this similarity, we formally map the D-MDS\\nproblem to a reference game setting as follows.\\nDefinition 2 (D-MDS as a reference game). Let\\nO \\u225c{d1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , dN} be the set of documents and\\nC \\u225c{si,j}1\\u2a7di\\u2a7dN,1\\u2a7dj\\u2a7dK the set of candidate sum-\\nmaries. Let M : O \\u00d7 C \\u2192[0, 1] be a truth matrix\\nthat indicates the likelihood of a candidate sum-\\nmary s being a summary of a document d. In stan-\\ndard reference games, the truth-matrix is boolean as\\nthe properties for an object are either true or false.\\nIn our setting, we approximate the truth-matrix\\nusing a pre-trained language model on summariza-\\ntion LM to score the likelihood of each candidate\\nsummary s to be associated with a document d:\\nM(t, s) \\u2248LM(s|d).\\n4.2\\nThe Pragmatic Summarizer\\nOne popular framework to efficiently tackle ref-\\nerence games is the Rational Speech Act (RSA)\\nmodel of human communication Frank and Good-\\nman (2012), which models optimal communication\\nbetween pragmatic agents and provides a formal\\nframework to build pragmatic speakers and listen-\\ners. Therefore, we propose two novel RSA-based\\nscores to select informative and unique opinions for\\nreview summarization, which we discuss in detail\\nin Sec. 5.2. In what follows, we present how we\\nadapt RSA to our summarization setting.\\nThe RSA framework posits that both the speaker\\nand listener maximize the utility of their commu-\\nnication and they both assume the other is rational.\\nThey iteratively adapt to each other to reach a com-\\nmon understanding of the context. Formally, we\\ndefine the utility of communicating to a listener L,\\nthe summary s for a document d as:\\nVL(s, d) = log L(d|s) \\u2212Cost(d),\\n(1)\\nwhere L(d|s) denotes the conditional probability\\nof guessing the object d \\u2014 the document\\/review in\\nour case \\u2014 upon receiving s \\u2014 a short summary\\u2014\\naccording to the listener L, Cost(s) is the cost of\\ntransmitting the summary s. In most cases, the\\ncost is assumed to be 0, and we measure the infor-\\nmativeness, which is defined with the conditional\\nprobability L(d|s).\\nPragmatic reasoning is modeled as an iterative\\nprocess that starts from a literal listener, i.e. a\\nlistener who has no assumption about the speaker.\\nWe denote it with L0(d|s) and define it using a\\npre-trained language model LM:\\nDefinition 3 (Literal listener).\\nL0(d|s) =\\nLM(s|d)\\nP\\nd\\u2208O LM(s|d).\\n(2)\\nThe pragmatic speaker adapts to a listener under\\nthe cost constraint by maximizing the communica-\\ntion utility (Zaslavsky et al., 2021). We define it as\\nfollows:\\nDefinition 4 (Pragmatic speaker). For a given tar-\\nget document d, the speaker\\u2019s distribution over the\\nsummaries is defined as the softmax of the utility\\nscores with a listener Lt\\u22121, where L0 is the literal\\n12740\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
