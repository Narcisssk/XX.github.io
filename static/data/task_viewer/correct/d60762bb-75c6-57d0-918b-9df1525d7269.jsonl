{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

This\\ntask consisted of five tracks:\\n\\u2022 Track 1: Empathy and Emotion Prediction in\\nConversations (CONV), which consists in pre-\\ndicting empathy, emotion polarity, and emo-\\ntional intensity in a conversation;\\n\\u2022 Track 2: Empathy Prediction (EMP), which\\nconsists in predicting empathy, and personal\\ndistress in an essay;\\n\\u2022 Track 3:\\nEmotion Classification (EMO),\\nwhich consists in predicting the emotion in\\nan essay;\\n\\u2022 Track 4: Personality Prediction (PER), which\\nconsists in predicting the conscientiousness,\\nopenness, extraversion, agreeableness, and\\nstability of the essay writer;\\n\\u2022 Track 5: Interpersonal Reactivity Index Pre-\\ndiction (IRI), which consists in predicting\\nperspective-taking, personal distress, fantasy,\\nand empathetic concern of the essay writer;\\nAlthough the prediction goals are different, all\\nfive tracks can be considered as either a sentiment\\nclassification (Peng et al., 2020) or regression task\\n(Kong et al., 2022). One of the biggest challenges\\nin this task lies in how to learn representation for\\nthe given text. The early exploration was based\\non text similarity (Jijkoun and Rijke, 2005) or text\\nalignment (de Marneffe et al., 2008). With the de-\\nvelopment of neural networks, convolutional neural\\nnetworks (CNN) (Kim, 2014) and recurrent neural\\nnetworks (RNN) (Zaremba et al., 2014) and their\\nvariants are adopted to learn text representations.\\nBoth CNN and RNN are shallow models, which\\nonly incorporate previous knowledge in the first\\nlayer of the model. The models are also based on\\nword embeddings that are useful in only capturing\\nthe semantic meaning of words without understand-\\ning higher-level concepts like anaphora, long-term\\ndependencies, and many more.\\nBeyond word embeddings, recent studies pro-\\nposed embedding from language models (ELMo),\\nwhich can learn word embeddings by incorporating\\nboth word-level characteristics as well as contex-\\ntual semantics (Zhang et al., 2021). This also led to\\nthe emergence of pre-trained models (PLM) using\\nTransformers as basic units. The PLMs, such as\\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al.,\\n2019), ALBERT (Lan et al., 2019), and DeBERTa\\n(He et al., 2020), are first fed a large amount of\\nunannotated data, allowing the model to learn the\\nusage of various words and how the language is\\nwritten in general. Then, they can be finetuned to\\nbe transferred to a Natural Language Processing\\n(NLP) task where it is fed another smaller task-\\nspecific dataset. As the scale of PLMs increases,\\nthe model performance in downstream tasks be-\\ncomes better and better. Nevertheless, the fine-\\n526\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"tuning procedure brings about increased require-\\nments for model training costs. For example, the\\nlarge sequence-to-sequence model GPT-3 has 175B\\nparameters (Brown et al., 2020). To reduce train-\\ning costs, recent studies suggest using parameter-\\nefficient fine-tuning (PEFT) (Houlsby et al., 2019)\\nto enable the efficient adaption of PLMs to down-\\nstream applications without fine-tuning all the pa-\\nrameters of the PLMs.\\nTo this end, this paper proposes to use DeBERTa\\nfine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu\\net al., 2021) in PEFT and RoBERTa for all tracks in\\nthis competition. Both the DeBERTa and RoBERTa\\nwere initialized from a well-trained checkpoint,\\ne.g., deberta-v2-xxlarge with 1.5B parame-\\nters and roberta-base with 125M parameters.\\nFor finetuning, LoRA only fine-tuned a small num-\\nber of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly de-\\ncreasing the computational and storage costs. For\\nclassification tasks, a softmax head with the cross-\\nentropy loss was applied, while a linear decoder\\nhead with the mean squared error was adopted for\\nregression tasks.\\nThe experimental results on the development\\ndataset show that the XXL version of DeBERTa\\nwith LoRA and back translation achieves the best\\nperformance in tracks 1, 3, and 5.\\nAlthough\\nthe number of trainable parameters decreases, the\\nmodel achieves performance comparable to that of\\nfull fine-tuning. Additionally, RoBERTa with back\\ntranslation achieved the best performance in tracks\\n2 and 4. The difference in the performance of the\\ntwo models on different tracks may be due to the\\nimpact of the size of the training dataset.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows.\\nSection 2 describes the system model and method.\\nSection 3 discusses the specific experimental re-\\nsults. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 4.\\n2\\nSystem description\\nThe architecture of the proposed model is shown\\nin Figure 1. The given text of conversations or es-\\nsays is input into the tokenizer and then segmented\\ninto the corresponding token ID. Subsequently, De-\\nBERTa or RoBERTa\\u2019s encoder is used to extract\\nthe features of the text in a vector format. Mean-\\nwhile, LoRA is used to reduce fine-tuning parame-\\nters without degrading performance too much. Fi-\\nnally, the encoded hidden representation is used for\\nboth sentiment classification and regression.\\nsoftmax\\n\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\nargmax\\nClass\\nLabel\\nOutput Layer\\nt[CLS]\\ntl\\ntn\\ntn+1\\ntm\\nt[SEP]\\n\\u2026\\n\\u2026\\nE[CLS]\\nE1\\nEn\\nEn+1\\nEm\\nE[SEP]\\n\\u2026\\n\\u2026\\nDeBERTa\\n[CLS]\\nx1\\nXn+1\\nxm\\n[SEP]\\n\\u2026\\n\\u2026\\nTokenizer\\nI feel so sad for these people.\\nIt breaks my heart to see \\nthem...\\nConversations\\nEssays\\nClass\\nScore\\nxn\\nor\\nFigure 1: The structure for the system.\\n2.1\\nTokenizer\\nSentencePiece and WordPiece were used for De-\\nBERTa and RoBERTa to divide the text into sub-\\nwords, respectively.

However, the hardware cost\\nof using large models is very significant. Mean-\\nwhile, large models are over-parameterized and\\nhave a smaller intrinsic dimension (Houlsby et al.,\\n2019). Therefore, this system used LoRA to freeze\\nmost parameters and fine-tune the model through\\nlow-rank matrices. The LoRA decomposition is\\ndefined as,\\nW0 + \\u2206Wx = W0 + BAx\\n(2)\\nwhere W0 represents the original parameter matrix.\\nIt is very huge and difficult to train. In this sys-\\ntem, training updates to W0 can be represented by\\n\\u2206W. Therefore, W can be frozen to reduce a large\\nnumber of training parameters. A and B represent\\nthe low-rank factorization matrix of W0. A is ini-\\ntialized with random Gaussian and B is initialized\\nwith zero. Therefore, \\u2206W is initialized with zero.\\nLoRA reduces parameters by training a low-rank\\niterative decomposition matrix of the original pa-\\nrameter matrix. The original parameters of XXL\\nDeBERTa used in this system are 1.5B, while the\\ntrainable parameters after LoRA processing are\\naround 4 million. So, this method makes using a\\nlarge language model on consumer-grade GPUs a\\nreality.\\n2.5\\nOutput Layer\\nThe output layer is implemented in two distinct\\nways to accomplish classification and regression\\ntasks.\\nRegression. Regression was performed for tracks\\n1, 2, 4, and 5.

The classification was performed\\nfor track 3. A softmax function is used to pre-\\ndict probability distribution over the candidate la-\\nbels. The training objective is to minimize the\\ncross-entropy between the predicted labels and the\\nground truth, denoted as,\\nL2 = \\u22121\\nN\\nX\\ni\\nC\\nX\\nc=1\\nyic log Pic\\n(4)\\nwhere C represents the number of categories clas-\\nsified, yic is the ground-truth label, and Pic repre-\\nsents the prediction probability of the c-th class.\\n3\\nExperimental Results\\nThis section evaluates the performance of the pro-\\nposed system for both sentiment classification and\\nregression tasks.\\n3.1\\nDatasets\\nThis task is based on an Empathic Conversations\\ndataset.
