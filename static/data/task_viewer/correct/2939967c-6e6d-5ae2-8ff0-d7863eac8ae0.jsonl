{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The progress of LLMs\\nhas also led to substantial breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Chen et al. [2024], Liu\\net al. [2024, 2023], Zhu et al. [2023]), facilitating complex visual-language dialogue and interaction, and bridging the\\ngap between textual and visual information. This has created a favorable opportunity for developing autonomous, GUI\\nagents in digital worlds.\\nVisually-enabled agents have immense potential in the real world, as they can directly perceive visual signals and\\ninteract with humans and GUIs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can acquire skills such as reading and programming,\\nfurther expanding their potential with multi-modal information. Some prior research has started to utilize VLM models\\nto achieve universality in GUI tasks. Agents like AppAgent (Zhang et al. [2023]), CogAgent (Hong et al. [2023]), and\\nMobileAgent (Wang et al.

A key component of MobileFlow is its hybrid visual encoder, which has been rigorously\\ntrained on a vast array of GUI pages. This extensive training enables MobileFlow to effectively extract and comprehend\\ninformation across diverse GUI interfaces. By relying on a purely visual perception approach, MobileFlow\\u2019s GUI agent\\neliminates the need to access system APIs to obtain page layout details.

It integrates visual and textual data via MoE and specialized GUI training. A CoT\\napproach during fine-tuning enhances accuracy by showing reasoning, making MobileFlow effective in real-world\\nbusiness applications.\\n1.1\\nRelated Work\\nVisual Language Models Visual Language Large models usually consist of three parts. An encoder projects various\\nmodalities into a high-dimensional space, followed by a module that aligns the information from all modalities\\nwithin this space, and finally, a decoder interprets the aligned information back into a specific modality. And as for\\nimplementation, VLMs can be divided into two types: one employs dedicated visual encoders like ViT (Dosovitskiy\\net al. [2021]), specific alignment modules like Qformer (Li et al. [2023]) (or MLP), combined with a trained LLM to\\nform a system, such as LLAVA, MiniGPT-4, Qwen-VL (Bai et al. [2023]), CogView (Ding et al. [2021]), etc.; the other\\ntype eliminates the independent visual and alignment modules, converting visual and textual content into tokens that are\\nthen fed directly into a Decoder-only architecture LLM, creating a unified end-to-end VLM, such as Fuyu-8B (Bavishi\\net al. [2023]), Chameleon (Team [2024]), and so on.\\nGUI Agents CogAgent is constructed based on CogVLM (Wang et al. [2024b]) and relies solely on image information,\\navoiding the need for system API calls, but its LLM component has not undergone targeted training. MobileAgent and\\nAppAgent utilize existing VLMs like GPT-4v to construct UI Agents, leaning more towards prompt engineering while\\nalso depending on external modules or APIs to obtain information under the UI layer. Ferret-UI (You et al. [2024]),\\nderived from Ferret (You et al. [2023]), supports arbitrary resolution image input, yet it still follows the traditional\\ntraining approach for dialogue and question-answering in general scenarios without optimizing for UI Navigation\\ncapabilities.\\nVision Foundation Models for VLMs For VLMs, the visual encoder component is of paramount importance as it\\ndetermines what can be \\\"seen\\\". Notably, widely-utilized architectures such as CLIP-ViT (Radford et al. [2021]) and\\nSigLIP (Zhai et al. [2023]) have spurred a series of studies aimed at identifying the most suitable visual encoders for\\nintegration into VLMs. For instance, identified marked differences in the visual representations captured by CLIP\\nand DINOv2 (Oquab et al. [2024]), leading to the creation of a mixed module that integrates features from both\\nmodels. Moreover, different approaches have been introduced that employ varied visual encoders to process images at\\ndistinct resolutions, thereby combining features at various levels of abstraction. For example, LLaVA-HR (Liu et al.\\n[2023]) features a bifurcated visual encoder that combines CLIP-ViT with CLIP-ConvNext[20], while DeepSeek-VL\\n(DeepSeek-AI et al. [2024]) incorporates SigLIP-L and SAM-B. These methodologies consistently leverage pre-trained\\nvisual perceptors. In this research, we introduce LayoutLMV3 (Huang et al. [2022]), a visual branch pretrained on\\nextensive UI data, capable of dynamically adjusting to UI images with varying aspect ratios, thereby enhancing the\\nunderstanding capabilities of the overall visual encoder and its applicability within GUI agents.\\n2\",\"section_summary\":\"This paper introduces MobileFlow, a multimodal LLM designed for GUI agents, excelling in handling Mandarin content and GUI tasks.

It uses a Qwen-7B-based language model as a universal interface, paired with a visual perception\\nmodule to gain dual \\\"visualizing\\\" capabilities. The paper\\u2019s architectural framework has three main parts: the visual\\nencoder, the visual-language adapter, and the extensive language model, as shown in Figure 2. This section will detail\\nthe enhancements and optimizations made for GUI tasks on the original model structure.\\nHybrid Visual Encoders The architecture of the proposed visual encoder is illustrated in Fig.3. In line with most\\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), we construct our visual perception model based on the pre-trained Vision Transformer\\n(ViT) structure. Specifically, for the ViT component, we utilize OpenAI\\u2019s OpenCLIP ViT-B\\/32 pre-trained weights\\nfor initialisation. In addition, we introduce a UI Encoder, with capabilities for variable resolution input, to augment\\nthe extraction of visual information. After extensive research, we have chosen the document intelligence model\\nLayoutLMv3, pre-trained with extensive document data, as the foundational structure for UI Encoder. We reassess\\nand recalibrate the visual model\\u2019s weights through redesigned UI image pre-training tasks on UI Encoder. In order to\\npreserve the original aspect ratio of UI images to the greatest extent possible, we propose a variable resolution-based\\nimage encoding methodology, which is explained as follows.\\nWhen we set the target image sequence length for UI Encoder to be 784 tokens, with each image patch sized at\\n16x16 pixels, and the input image size is 1216x576, yielding an aspect ratio of 19:9, the resolution is recalculated by\\ndynamically adjusting the width and height to compute an extreme aspect ratio while maintaining the original aspect\\nratio as closely as possible, under the sequence length constraint. In this example, the calculated number of image\\npatches in the width and height directions are 41 and 19, respectively. Therefore, the recalculated dimensions for width\\nand height are 41x16 and 19x16, respectively. And the total number of image patches amounts to 41x19=779, and the\\nremaining 5 patches will be filled through padding.\\n2.1\\nModel Architecture\\nAs shown in Fig.3, we employ MLM (Masked Language Modeling), MIM (Masked Image Modeling), WPA (Word-\\nPatch Alignment), and RCG (Real Component Generation) as pre-training tasks of UI Encoder. Both MLM and MIM\\nare popular and widely used pre-training tasks, as referenced in (Devlin et al. [2019], Bao et al. [2022]). The WPA task,\\nintroduced by the LayoutLMv3 paper (Huang et al. [2022]), predicts whether the corresponding image patch of a text\\nword is masked, facilitating the learning of multi-modal alignment. The RCG task involves initially employing control\\nrecognition capabilities to detect all controls on a given UI interface, followed by randomly replacing these controls at a\\npredetermined ratio. An image decoder is then utilized to reconstruct the original UI interface.\\nVision-Language Adapter MobileFlow introduces a Vision-Language Adapter designed to compress image features\\nand fuse output features from multiple visual encoders. The adapter consists of the cross-attention mechanism and the\\nMLP module. The cross-attention module employs a set of trainable vectors as query vectors, with image features from\\nthe visual encoders serving as key vectors, to condense each set of visual encoder features into a fixed length of 256.\\nThe MLP module integrates the features from parallel visual perception modules, projecting the visual features into the\\nsemantic space of the large language model with a minimal number of parameters. This configuration allows the model\\nto flexibly perceive and understand visual modality information.\\nFigure 2: Overview of MobileFlow.\\nMoE Expansion Many practices have shown that if LLMs adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) expansion, they can\\nachieve a significant performance improvement while maintaining low inference costs. Most language models in current\\nVLMs use a dense structure; hence, introducing the MoE approach to VLMs is also expected to provide considerable\\nimprovement. Generally speaking, there are two main methods of MoE expansion. One is to use random activations of\\nmultiple experts (where the routing is learnable, a typical example being Mixtral-8x7B (Jiang et al. [2024])), and the\\nother is a combination of shared expert activations with random expert activations (with shared experts capturing global\\nfeatures, a typical example being DeepSeek-Chat (DeepSeek-AI et al. [2024])). In terms of implementation difficulty,\\nthis paper adopts the same method of random activations of multiple experts as Mixtral.\\nFor MoE architecture models, an MoE layer typically contains multiple feedforward networks (FFNs). To leverage\\nthe visual understanding and dialogue question-answering capabilities learned during multi-stage training by Qwen-\\nVL-Chat, MobileFlow adopts the method of directly duplicating the original MLP for expansion. Each MoE layer\\nobtained after expansion includes 4 identical MLPs as initial experts. Multiple studies have shown that using trained\\nMLPs as initial experts leads to quicker and more stable convergence during subsequent training and ultimately better\\nperformance compared to randomly initialized experts.\\nTo sum up, MobileFlow\\u2019s architecture consists of three main components, similar to other VLMs: a hybrid visual\\nunderstanding network with multiple encoders, a visual-language alignment module, and an LLM enhanced with MoE.\\nDuring training and inference, GUI screenshots are processed by the network to extract both global and detailed local\\nfeatures. These visual tokens, combined with text tokens from user inputs, OCR text, and BBOX data from the GUI, are\\nfed into the LLM after alignment.\\n2.2\\nTraining Formulation\\nGUI Alignment For large multimodal models, training happens in two phases. First is visual-language alignment\\npre-training, where the model learns to connect images with text for appropriate responses. Second is instruction\\nfine-tuning, where it learns to follow instructions for complex tasks like VQA, visual reasoning, and dialogue. Qwen-\\nVL-Chat, trained on a lot of data, excels in image-text tasks after these phases. MobileFlow, inheriting Qwen-VL-Chat\\u2019s\\nmultilingual image understanding, doesn\\u2019t need full-scale pre-training but light GUI alignment and fine-tuning for good\\nGUI agent skills. This light stage includes four training tasks:\\nGUI Grounding: The purpose of this task is to help the model establish connections between text and specific areas in\\nan image. Given that app pages typically contain rich textual information and various UI designs, incorporating this\\ntype of task can enhance the model\\u2019s spatial understanding of the page.\\nGUI Referring: Given specific bounding boxes or spatial references in text descriptions (such as upper left, lower right,\\netc.) or number references (first, last, third on the right, etc.), the model is required to output textual information at\\nthose positions. The model can understand the content referred to by the text and identify and locate the referent object\\nin the image, which is crucial for a GUI Agent since many users\\u2019 actual intentions often include references.\\nFigure 3: Overview of UI Encoder.\\nUI Image Question Answering: Here, we use the open-source ScreenQa dataset[28] to familiarize the model with and\\nunderstand mobile GUI interfaces, transferring its foundational VQA capabilities to GUI-styled page content. The\\nScreenQA dataset contains a diverse range of VQA types, including both the extraction of page information and the\\ninference of page content.\\nImage Description with Object Location: MobileFlow is required to describe the image in details with the objects\\u2019\\nbounding boxes. This task further reinforces the model\\u2019s spatial understanding of GUI pages.\\nGUI Chain-of-Thought The core idea of CoT is to have the model generate a series of intermediate steps or explanatory\\nstatements before delivering the final answer. These steps resemble the human thought process in problem-solving\\nand gradually lead to the derivation of the solution. However, in most current multimodal LLMs, models tend to\\ndirectly output answers without providing the reasoning process or rationale. This approach often fails in scenarios\\nthat require high-level logical reasoning (e.g., in a GUI Agent where continual decision-making, clicking, or swiping\\nis necessary to fulfill user intentions). Therefore, in MobileFlow, we employ the CoT technique in both training and\\ninference of the model. After being modified with CoT, the model shows a noticeable improvement in link accuracy\\nand question-answering accuracy.MobileFlow adopts a Chain of Thought definition similar to AppAgent, where intent\\nexecution tasks consist of four steps:\\nObservation: Describing the contents observed on the GUI page, integrating information about page controls.\\nReasoning: Considering how to operate on the current page to accomplish the given task.\\nAction: Generating behaviors within the Agent\\u2019s action space, which could be clicking, swiping, or typing text.\\nSummary: Summarizing the actions and previous behaviors as historical information for the next round interaction.\\nThe task structure for visual question answering is similar, except that the action step is replaced with generating an\\nanswer. The detailed prompt structure is shown in Appendix B.\\n3\",\"section_summary\":\"MobileFlow integrates a visual encoder and a large language model through a fusion module, using a Qwen-7B-based model and a hybrid visual encoder.
