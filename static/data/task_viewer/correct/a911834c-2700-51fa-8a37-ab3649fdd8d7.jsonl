{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

These aspects are less emphasized in the medical domain since they do not directly impact treatment outcomes.\\nTo ensure the accuracy of the generated text, many existing methods evaluate factual consistency (Thorne et al., 2018; Augenstein et al., 2019; Min et al., 2023), which compares the factual statements in the generated text and the input. Among our proposed aspects, conciseness and attribution both incorporate the need for factual consistency.

Clinical note generation is defned as generating a \\u201cSOAP\\u201d note given a dialogue between a doctor and a patient (Yim et al., 2023; Ben Abacha et al., 2023a). A SOAP note consists of the subjective, objective Exam, objective results, and assessment and plan sections. We conduct experiments on the ACI-BENCH dataset (Yim et al., 2023). A test example is shown in Table 16.\\nRadiology report summarization. We follow the setting from Van Veen et al. (2023), where the input is the fndings section of a radiology report, and the goal is to generate an impression section that contains key observations and conclusions. we utilize the public test set of MIMIC-III (Johnson et al., 2016). A test example is shown in Table 17.\\nPatient question summarization. Question summarization aims to generate a condensed question expressing the minimum information required to fnd correct answers to the original question (Abacha and Demner-Fushman, 2019). We utilize the MeQSum dataset, which consists of consumer health questions and their corresponding summaries authored by medical experts. A test example is shown in Table 18.\\nEvaluation methods. We evaluate the three tasks with DOCLENS computed with GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), and TRUE (Honovich et al., 2022), representing three types of models. We also apply existing commonly-used metrics (Yim et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2021; Veen et al., 2023). We list the metrics for each task in Table 10.

We observe that the results under most metrics can be improved by adding in-context examples, but increasing the number of examples from 1 to 2 leads to diminishing returns. Intriguingly, when the prompt only contains the instruction with no examples, GPT3.5-turbo often fails to generate any citations or produces all citations together at the end. In contrast, GPT-4 consistently generates citations in the correct format across the three datasets.\\nProprietary vs. Open-source generation models. As shown in Figure 4, GPT-based models outperform open-source models in the majority of experiments. We also observe that open-source models typically generate much shorter outputs than GPT-based models with heavy omission.

As our primary goal is to compare pairs of metrics, to reduce the required amount of human annotation, we only annotate pairs of system outputs where the two metrics disagree: one metric ranks one system\\nFigure 8: Kendall\\u2019s $\\\\tau$ coeffcients between recall-based and precision-based metrics on note generation.\\noutput higher, and the other metric ranks the other output higher.

We can also observe from Table 2 and Figure 7 that there is still a large gap between opensource models (Mistral and TRUE) and GPT-4. As shown in Table 3, we observe several patterns in the cases where GPT-4 and Mistral disagree: [Case 1] The judgment requires medical knowledge. In claim 1, a medical expert would know that \\u201clungs are clear\\u201d already means there are \\u201cno wheezes, rales, or rhonch\\u201d and hence \\u201cclear bilaterally\\u201d fully support this claim.

[Case 2] The output only partially entails the subclaim. Although output 2 mentions the \\u201csystolic ejection murmur\\u201d, it omits the fact that the murmur is unchanged, but Mistral does not capture the omission. [Case 3] Multiple facts are related to each other. Output 2 omits the fact of \\u201cno masses\\u201d in claim 3. However, Mistral wrongly predicts claim 3 as \\u201csupported\\u201d with the explanation: The notes states that there is no tenderness, which could potentially indicate that there is no masses.

In our experiments, we randomly sample 200 examples following the proportion of each Modality\\/Anatomy category (e.g., CT head, MR spine) for evaluation. Similarly, we require each sentence to cite at least one sentence in the input.\\nPatient question summarization experiments. We conduct patient question summarization experiments on MeQSum (Abacha and Demner-Fushman, 2019). It contains (1) original patient health questions of varying verbosity and coherence selected from the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and (2) corresponding condensed questions created by\\nTable 7: Accuracy of each evaluator on claim recall evaluation on ACI-BENCH. We select 100 sentences where at least two of these models have different predictions. We consider human annotations as the ground truth.\\nReference subclaims   \\n1. The patient\\u2019s carotid arteries do not have audible bruits.   \\n2. The patient\\u2019s lungs are clear to auscultation on both sides, with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.   \\n3. The patient exhibits a slight 2\\/6 systolic ejection murmur in the cardiovascular exam, which is stable.   \\n4. The patient has a normal heart rate.   \\n5. The patient has trace lower extremity edema in both legs.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 16 is an example of clinical note generation under the full-note generation setting. The input is the dialogue between the doctor and the patient and the target output is the full clinical note based on the dialogue. We highlight the four sections in the reference clinical note, which is divided automatically by the name of each paragraph (e.g., \\u201cREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\\u201d belongs to the subjective section). As for per-section generation, the input is the same and the target output contains only one of the four sections.\\nTable 17 is an example of radiology report summarization. The input is the fndings section of the radiology report, containing experiment results and fndings. The target output is the impression section of the report, which should summarize the important information in the fndings section.\\nTable 18 shows an example of patient question summarization. The input is the patient question of varying verbosity and coherence, and the goal is to summarize the input into a short question that allows retrieving complete, correct answers to the original question.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
