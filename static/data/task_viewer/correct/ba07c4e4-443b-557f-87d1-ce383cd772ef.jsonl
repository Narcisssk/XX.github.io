{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Its inherent local characteristic enhances its scalability for po-\\ntentially more extensive systems. In contrast to other models, ALLEGRO predicts the energy as a\\nfunction of the final edge embedding rather than the node embeddings.

While maintaining\\nthe two-body interactions of NequIP in each layer, it increments the body order by one with every\\niteration of message passing. Unlike NEQUIP, BOTNET uses non-linearities in the update step.\\nMACE Batatia et al. (2022b) offers efficient equivariant messages with high body order compu-\\ntation. Due to the augmented body order of the messages, merely two message-passing iterations\\nsuffice to attain notable accuracy.

As for Table 1, we compare \\u201cEquiformer\\u201d with other works since most of them do not\\ninclude equivariance to inversion.\\nTask\\n\\u03b1\\n\\u2206\\u03b5\\n\\u03b5HOMO\\n\\u03b5LUMO\\n\\u00b5\\nC\\u03bd\\nTraining time\\nNumber of\\nMethods\\nUnits\\na3\\n0\\nmeV\\nmeV\\nmeV\\nD\\ncal\\/mol K\\n(minutes\\/epoch)\\nparameters\\nEquiformer\\n.046\\n30\\n15\\n14\\n.011\\n.023\\n12.1\\n3.53M\\nE(3)-Equiformer\\n.045\\n30\\n15\\n14\\n.012\\n.023\\n16.3\\n3.28M\\nTable 9: Ablation study of SE(3)\\/E(3) equivariance on QM9 testing set. \\u201cEquiformer\\u201d operates\\non SE(3)-equivariant features while \\u201cE(3)-Equiformer\\u201d uses E(3)-equivariant features. Including\\ninversion achieves similar performance.\\nD.3\\nCOMPARISON OF TRAINING TIME AND NUMBERS OF PARAMETERS\\nWe compare training time and numbers of parameters between SEGNN (Brandstetter et al., 2022),\\nTorchMD-NET (Th\\u00f6lke & Fabritiis, 2022) and Equiformer and summarize the results in Table 10.\\nTraining Equiformer for 300 epochs and for 600 epochs takes 61 and 122 GPU-hours, respectively.\\nCompared to SEGNN, which is written with the same e3nn library (Geiger et al., 2022), Equiformer\\nwith MLP attention and non-linear message is faster. Although Equiformer has more channels and\\nmore parameters, the training time is comparable. The reasons are as follows. Equiformer uses more\\nefficient depth-wise tensor products (DTP), where one output channel depends on only one input\\nchannel. SEGNN uses more compute-intensive fully connected tensor products (FCTP), where one\\noutput channel depends on all input channels. Besides, SEGNN uses 4 FCTPs in each message\\npassing block while Equiformer uses only 2 DTPs in each block.\\nCompared to TorchMD-NET, which is trained for 3000 epochs, Equiformer achieves competitve\\nresults after trained for 300 or 600 epochs. Equiformer takes more time for each epoch since\\nEquiformer uses more expressive non-linear messages, which compared to linear messages used in\\nother equivariant Transformers, doubles the number of tensor products and therefore almost doubles\\nthe training time. Moreover, Equiformer incorporates tensors of higher degrees (e.g., Lmax = 2),\\nwhich improves performance but slows down the training.\\nE\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"DETAILS OF EXPERIMENTS ON MD17\\nE.1\\nTRAINING DETAILS\\nWe use the same data partition as TorchMD-NET (Th\\u00f6lke & Fabritiis, 2022). For energy prediction,\\nwe normalize ground truth by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation. For force\\nprediction, we normalize ground truth by dividing by standard deviation of ground truth energy.\\nWe train Equiformer with 6 blocks with Lmax = 2 and 3.

Equiformer with Lmax = 2 is faster than NequIP with Lmax = 3 since smaller Lmax\\nis used. Moreover, Equiformer with Lmax = 2 achieves overall better results as we use equivariant\\ngraph attention instead of linear convolution used by NequIP.
