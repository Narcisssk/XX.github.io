{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "[Question]: How many hours and separate recordings are contained in the STT4SG-350 corpus?\n[Answer Format]: Your answer should be s single python list of two integers, e.g. [200, 5674].

The corpus represents all\\nSwiss German dialect regions and contains 343\\nhours of speech.\\nSwiss German is a family of German dialects\\nspoken by around 5 million people in Switzerland.\\nIt differs from Standard German regarding phonol-\\nogy, vocabulary, morphology, and syntax. There\\nare significant differences among the Swiss Ger-\\nman dialects as well, particularly regarding phonol-\\nogy and vocabulary. Swiss German is primarily\\na spoken language. It is also used in writing, but\\nmainly in informal text messages. In most other\\ncontexts, including formal letters, laws, and news-\\npapers, Standard German is used instead. One\\nimportant reason for this is Swiss German\\u2019s lack of\\na standardized orthography.\\nThe diversity among dialects, exacerbated by the\\nlack of a standardized orthography, leads to a large\\nnumber of written variants for each word. This,\\ntogether with the small amount of text resources\\ncompared to Standard German, makes automated\\nprocessing of Swiss German text challenging.\\nSTT4SG-350 is, to the best of our knowledge,\\nthe largest public speech corpus for Swiss German.\\nWhile the primary use case is automatic speech\\nrecognition (ASR), it is also a useful resource for\\ntext-to-speech (TTS), dialect identification, and\\nspeaker recognition. By providing roughly the\\nsame amount of data per dialect region, irrespec-\\ntive of its population size, the corpus contributes to\\nimproving speech technology for underrepresented\\ndialects. In addition, the test set, which contains\\nthe same spoken sentences in each dialect, allows a\\nfair evaluation of the quality of speech technologies\\nin different dialects. Furthermore, it contributes to\\nmore inclusive speech technology by keeping a bal-\\nanced gender ratio and featuring speakers of all\\nages.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nThe SDS-200 corpus (Pl\\u00fcss et al., 2022) contains\\n200 hours of speech by around 4,000 speakers with\\nStandard German transcripts. The recordings cover\\na large part of the Swiss German dialect landscape.\\nThe number of recordings per speaker follows a\\nlong-tail distribution. For example, the top 3 speak-\\n1763\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"ers account for 23% of recordings. The Swiss\\nParliaments Corpus or SPC (Pl\\u00fcss et al., 2021a)\\ncontains 299 hours of speech in the Bernese di-\\nalect. The text is Standard German, taken from\\nparliament minutes, and is not a fully accurate tran-\\nscription. Text and audio are automatically aligned.\\nThe SwissDial corpus (Dogan-Sch\\u00f6nberger et al.,\\n2021) contains 26 hours of studio-quality record-\\nings by 8 speakers, each speaking a different di-\\nalect, with both Standard German and Swiss Ger-\\nman transcripts. The Radio Rottu Oberwallis cor-\\npus (Garner et al., 2014) contains 8 hours of speech\\ntranscribed in Swiss German, of which 2 are also\\ntranscribed in Standard German. The ArchiMob\\ncorpus (Samard\\u017ei\\u00b4\\nc et al., 2016) contains 69 hours\\nof speech with Swiss German transcripts.\\nFor Swiss German ASR, the desired output text\\nlanguage is Standard German for the vast majority\\nof use cases. Tackling speech-to-text translation\\nwith an end-to-end approach is feasible as shown by\\nWeiss et al. (2017). Applying a similar approach to\\nSwiss German ASR and therefore avoiding Swiss\\nGerman text and its challenges altogether lead to\\npromising results in recent years, see (Pl\\u00fcss et al.,\\n2023; Khosravani et al., 2021; Pl\\u00fcss et al., 2022,\\n2021a).\\nDogan-Sch\\u00f6nberger et al. (2021) experiment\\nwith TTS for Swiss German. Their models achieve\\na 5-scale mean opinion score of 2.9 to 4.1. Impor-\\ntantly, their approach requires Swiss German input\\ntext.\\n3\\nData Collection\\nData for STT4SG-350 was collected in two phases:\\n1) the test set with 76 participants from December\\n2021 until March 2022, and 2) the train and vali-\\ndation sets with 240 participants from May until\\nNovember 2022.\\n3.1\\nRecording\\nSpeech was recorded using a web app based on\\nthe code1 by Pl\\u00fcss et al. (2022). Recordings are\\nmade sentence by sentence. The app displays a\\nStandard German sentence, which the participant\\nis asked to translate to Swiss German and speak\\naloud. A screenshot of the recording functional-\\nity can be found in Appendix A. The goal of the\\ntranslation step is to get a correct, natural-sounding\\nSwiss German sentence in the participant\\u2019s dialect.\\nWe display a popup with examples before the first\\n1MPL-2.0 license\\nrecording to explain this to participants. We also\\ndisplay a short explanation below the sentence to\\nbe recorded. We manually validated the correct-\\nness of at least 10 randomly sampled recordings per\\nparticipant at collection time. In contrast to Pl\\u00fcss\\net al. (2022), for phase 2, we recorded 44.1 kHz\\nlossless FLAC audio rather than 32 kHz lossy MP3\\naudio. The recording quality depends on the mi-\\ncrophones used by participants, which range from\\nstudio microphones to headsets and laptop micro-\\nphones. Depending on the microphone, mouse\\nclicks can be audible in recordings.\\n3.2\\nDialect Regions\\nFor this work, we divided the Swiss German dialect\\ncontinuum into 7 dialect regions, listed in Table 1,\\nbased on the clustering method by Scherrer and\\nStoeckle (2016)2. The cluster analysis was carried\\nout on 350 phonological, lexical, morphological,\\nand syntactic phenomena. We slightly adjusted\\nthe resulting clusters to match the dialect regions\\ncommonly used in public discourse more closely.\\nThe goal of these adjustments was to make it more\\nintuitive for participants to choose their dialect re-\\ngion. The borders are intentionally fuzzy to give\\nparticipants the freedom to choose the region that\\nfits their dialect best.\\n3.3\\nSentence Selection\\nSentences were randomly selected from Swiss\\nnewspapers and from parliament minutes of 2\\nSwiss parliaments. Sentence filtering for news-\\npapers follows Pl\\u00fcss et al. (2022). The goal of\\nthe filtering is to limit sentence complexity to re-\\nduce errors in the translation task. For example,\\nonly sentences of 5 to 12 words are kept. The\\nnewspaper sentences cover a broad range of topics,\\nincluding culture, finance, science, sports, and tech-\\nnology. They also cover content and named entities\\nparticularly relevant for Switzerland. Parliament\\nsentences are not filtered. They bring additional\\ndiversity to the corpus with longer sentences on\\naverage and a distinct vocabulary. For the test set,\\n3,515 sentences were selected (67% newspapers,\\nand 33% parliaments). To allow a fair comparison\\namong the dialects, each sentence was recorded in\\neach of the 7 dialects. For the training and valida-\\ntion data, 94% news and 6% parliament sentences\\nwere selected, and we dropped the requirement to\\nrecord each sentence in all dialect regions to in-\\n2Population statistics from https:\\/\\/www.bfs.admin.ch\\n1764\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"crease vocabulary and phrase diversity.\\n3.4\\nMetadata\\nParticipants self-reported the following metadata:\\n\\u2022 The dialect region that best fits the partici-\\npant\\u2019s dialect.\\n\\u2022 The zip code of the place where the participant\\ngrew up or went to school.\\n\\u2022 Age group (< 19, 19-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59,\\n60-69, 70-79, 80-89, > 89)\\n\\u2022 Gender (female, male, non-binary)\\nWe manually checked the correspondence of re-\\nported metadata and recordings for each participant.\\nCollecting the dialect provenance as a zip code al-\\nlows us to investigate dialects and the performance\\nof speech technologies for them at different granu-\\nlarity levels. Collecting age group and gender helps\\nto make sure that speech technology is inclusive\\nand works across different demographic groups.\\n3.5\\nRecruitment\\nFor the test set, all participants were recruited via\\nthe crowdsourcing platform TestingTime3. For the\\ntrain set, half the participants were recruited via\\nTestingTime, whereas the other half were recruited\\nvia universities, high schools, newspaper ads, per-\\nsonal contacts, and the crowdsourcing platform\\nseniors@work4 (for details refer to Appendix F\\nand 6). Only native Swiss German speakers able\\nto correctly translate Standard German to Swiss\\nGerman were recruited. The goal was to collect\\nthe same amount of recordings in each dialect re-\\ngion and we recruited accordingly. The number of\\nrecordings per participant was limited to 368 for\\nthe test set5 and 1,112 for the train data.

While the German-speaking population\\ndiffers by a factor of up to 16 between regions,\\nthe number of recordings per region is a lot more\\nbalanced, differing by a factor of not more than 1.2.\\n4.3\\nSplits\\nTable 2 shows the different corpus splits. We pro-\\nvide training, validation, and test splits. There is\\nno speaker overlap between training, validation,\\nand test. There are no common sentences between\\ntest and either training or validation. There is, how-\\never, an intersection of 835 sentences between train-\\ning and validation. There are 2 different training\\nsplits. train_all contains all training data, 276 hours\\nof speech. train_balanced is a subset of train_all\\nwith 239 hours of speech that is balanced in the\\nnumber of recordings per dialect region. For GR,\\nthe region with the fewest recordings, the record-\\nings of all speakers are included in train_balanced.\\nFor the other regions, we randomly chose speakers\\nand added their recordings until the number of GR\\nrecordings was reached. train_balanced includes\\n33-35 hours of speech, 24,088-25,183 recordings,\\nand 25-32 speakers per region.\\nLike train_balanced, the validation split, with\\n34 hours of speech, is balanced in the number of\\nrecordings per dialect region. We randomly chose\\n3 speakers per region with at least 1,000 recordings.\\nThe test set comprises 34 hours of speech. Impor-\\ntantly, the same 3,515 sentences were recorded in\\nall 7 dialect regions to allow a fair comparison be-\\ntween different dialects. The test split contains at\\nleast 8 different speakers per region to provide ad-\\nDataset\\nWER\\nBLEU\\nvalidation\\ntest\\nvalidation\\ntest\\nASGDTS\\n19.9 \\u00b1 .1\\n20.7 \\u00b1 .3\\n67.0 \\u00b1 .2\\n66.0 \\u00b1 .4\\nASGDTS SOTA\\n38.7\\n-\\n41.9\\n46.0\\nSDS-200\\n18.4 \\u00b1 .1\\n18.2 \\u00b1 .1\\n69.9 \\u00b1 .1\\n69.6 \\u00b1 .1\\nSDS-200 SOTA\\n21.7\\n21.6\\n63.9\\n64.0\\nSPC\\n-\\n30.2 \\u00b1 .1\\n-\\n54.9 \\u00b1 .2\\nSPC SOTA\\n-\\n23.7\\n-\\n60.7\\nSTT4SG-350\\n13.6 \\u00b1 .1\\n14.0 \\u00b1 .1\\n75.0 \\u00b1 .1\\n74.7 \\u00b1 .1\\nTable 3: Performance of the XLS-R Wav2Vec 1B model\\nfine-tuned on the STT4SG-350 train_balanced split.

XLS-R is a model based\\non wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) with 965\\nmillion parameters pretrained on 436K hours of\\nunlabeled speech data covering more than 128 lan-\\nguages. Swiss German was not part of the training\\ndata. We provide the fine-tuning details and experi-\\nmental setup in appendix C.\\nWe report the results of our fine-tuned model on\\nthree publicly available Swiss German datasets and\\nthe STT4SG-350 validation and test sets in Table 3.\\nThe model achieves state-of-the-art results on the\\nAll Swiss German Dialects Test Set (ASGDTS)\\n(Pl\\u00fcss et al., 2021b) and SDS-200 (Pl\\u00fcss et al.,\\n2022), and improves the best reported BLEU scores\\non the test sets by 43% and 9%, respectively. Our\\nmodel is 6% behind the best reported BLEU score\\non the SPC test set (Pl\\u00fcss et al., 2021a). These\\nresults highlight the benefit of the STT4SG-350\\ndataset on test data from different domains.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nWe have described STT4SG-350, which is, to the\\nbest of our knowledge, the largest public speech\\ncorpus for Swiss German with 343 hours of speech.\\nOur ASR baseline model trained on the corpus\\nachieves a BLEU score of 74.7 on the test set. In\\naddition, it beats the best published BLEU scores\\n8Apache-2.0 license\\n1766\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
