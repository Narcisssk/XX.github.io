{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

A common alternative is to\\nuse a small encoder-only models like BERT(Devlin et al., 2019) or XLM-R(Conneau et al., 2019) for\\nextractive QA. However, these smaller models rely on a large quantity of annotated data which is\\nscarce and difficult to obtain, especially for multilingual and domain-specific settings.

This results in lower data\\nquality compared to annotated data. As demonstrated in (Shakeri et al., 2021), generative models\\nenable task-specific, cross-lingual data generation through fine-tuning on a single language. However,\\nthis process is expensive due to the large number of parameters involved in fine-tuning LLMs. In this\\npaper, we focus on generating high-quality synthetic data in low-resource scenarios without the need\\nfor teacher model fine-tuning. We propose to apply AlexaTM 20B (Soltan et al., 2022) to generate\\nsynthetic question answering data by prompting the model with a 1 shot in-context example, and\\nwe apply a semi supervised approach based on WeakDAP (Chen et al., 2022) on the student model\\nXLM-R-Base to identify high quality examples from generated data and incrementally improve the\\nperformance.

The context\\nused for QG are employed in cross lingual solutions such as generating in English first and then\\ntranslated using machine translation (MT) into the required language, where (Li and Callison-Burch,\\n2023) did this using alignment, while (Fabbri et al., 2020) have also looked into template based\\ngeneration for specific domains. On the other hand (Riabi et al., 2021) have looked into generating\\nthe synthetic data in the target language directly. One difference with such works, is that GeMQuAD\\ndoesn\\u2019t rely on MT and parallel corpora as we are using multilingual models. QA can be seen as the\\ncounterpart of the QG problem, as demonstrated by (Kramchaninova and Defauw, 2022) in utilizing\\ncontext-based candidate answers to create questions. Prior work (Shakeri et al., 2021) assesses\\nQuestion & Answer (Q&A) quality through automatic evaluations, while (Riabi et al., 2021) and\\n(Agrawal et al., 2023) have considered downstream QA tasks to quantify their performance.\\nQAMELEON (Agrawal et al., 2023) the most recent related work to ours, also addressed this\\nproblem by treating Q&A generation as a single task. We believe this approach has the potential for\\nbetter growth compared to treating it as two separate tasks, as it preserves the dependency between\\nquestions and answers. Similar to us, QAMELEON proposes using LLMs to generate synthetic\\nQ&A pairs via ICL with 5 golden samples, which they then use to fine-tune a QA model to evaluate\\ntheir contributions. The core concept of QAMELEON involves Prompt Tuning (PT) their LLM\\n2\\n(PaLM-540B Chowdhery et al. (2022)) for the QA task to generate high quality data and evaluate\\ntheir approach on mt5-XL Xue et al. (2021). Prompt Tuning (PT) is a parameter efficient fine\\ntuning technique that learns and updates the model parameters specific to input prompt only rather\\nthan updating the entire LLM parameters. From a computational perspective, while PT is more\\neffective than FT, it still involves tuning the LLM like PaLM 540B which is of high computational\\ncost. QAMELEON also claims their acheived performance is tied to the base LLM model used i.e.,\\nPaLM 540B. However, we believe that using an LLM as large as PaLM is not feasible in low-budget\\nscenarios. Our GeMQuAD approach is a generalised framework which can be applied to any type of\\nsynthetic data, to get high quality pairs from the overall generated dataset. We experimented with\\nsmaller models with a consideration on low-cost execution, with no fine-tuning of the generation\\nmodels, and we are utilizing an iterative approach to develop on our synthetic data as compared to\\nutilizing all the synthetic data generated. To compare our results with QAMELEON, we were unable\\nto replicate the generation strategy because PaLM-540B is a closed model, and the languages in the\\nreleased QAMELEON dataset do not overlap with our targeted languages.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Methodology\\nTo improve multilingual performance of the downstream Extractive QA task, our approach consists\\nof 3 major steps. 1) Generate synthetic question answer data using 1-shot ICL on AlexaTM 20B\\n(teacher) model; 2) Apply our semi-supervised learning approach to filter good quality records; 3)\\nfine-tune student model XLM-R-Base with filtered data from step 2.

More details on ICL configuration used is mentioned in the Experimental Setup section.\\nFigure 2: The semi-supervised fine-tuning approach of student using the data generated from teacher.\\nData generation is a one-time step in which an LLM (AlexaTM) is utilized to create synthetic data\\nusing few-shot learning. The data is then passed to the Data Filtering & Model Tuning stage, where it\\niteratively filters high-quality records and enhances the labeling model through fine-tuning student\\n(XLM-R-base) until optimal performance is achieved, based on predetermined stopping criteria.\\n3.2\\nSemi-supervised learning approach\\nWe are generating data in a low-resource setting, i.e., 1-shot learning. The model generated synthetic\\ndata would be of lower quality compared to annotated data. While quality checks can be added to\\nexclude the low quality pairs as part of post processing step, these checks are limited to deterministic\\nand structural validations only. As part of the post-processing, we verify that the answer is a part of\\nthe context, and remove any duplicate Q&A pairs from the dataset.\\nTo identify good quality functional pairs, we extend the WeakDAP approach with our customization\\nto fine-tuning the student model XLM-R-base for filtering out the correctly generated synthetic data.\\nAs shown in Figure 2, the workflow begins with the generation of synthetic data in the target language\\n3\\nfrom the teacher model via ICL using the format shown in Figure 1. Once the data generation is\\ncomplete, a weak labeler evaluates the synthetic data for the Extractive QA task. Given a (context,\\nquestion) tuple as input, the labeler predicts the answer span within the respective context.\\nIn our experiments, we initially use our baseline model as the weak labeler, which is trained on\\nEnglish annotated data corpus (Gold data) for Extractive QA task. As the labeler has not seen any data\\nin target language during training, the Extractive QA performance of the model on target language\\nis limited, and mainly relies on the cross-lingual transfer ability of the base model on which it is\\nfine-tuned. From the synthetic dataset, any questions where our labeler is able to provide the same\\nanswer as generated by the teacher model can be considered of high quality and relevant to the\\ncontext. Consequently, all the Q&A pairs that the labeler accurately generates based on the synthetic\\ndata answer labels are filtered and added to the silver dataset.\\n3.3\\nStudent model fine-tuning\\nThe student model gets fine-tuned first on the data filtered from semi-supervised approach (silver\\ndata) and then on the gold data. This is to prioritize the higher quality data in the later part of the\\nFT which we find improves the model performance. Similar analysis is reported by (Riabi et al.,\\n2021) too in their works.

For baseline comparison, we evaluated our approach against two models. XLMRbbaseline\\nwas fine-tuned solely on the SQUADen10k subset. We compared our approach with data augmentation\\nusing machine translation (MT) (Hu et al., 2020), XLMRbMT was fine-tuned on a combined dataset\\nthat included SQUADen10k, as well as its machine-translated version of Hindi and Spanish data.\\nXLMRbbaseline is also the initial version of our weak labeler in semi supervised filtering approach.\\nWe run loops of iterations, where in each iteration we fine-tune student model on batches of silver\\ndata filtered by labeler and SQUADen10k.

The batch\\nof synthetic samples that are classified as correctly generated in the current iteration by our student\\nmodel, are included in silver data for fine-tuning the student model in next iteration. Iterations are\\nstopped if the improvement in model QA task performance for k=2 rounds by threshold e<0.005 or\\nthe new sample batch volume added to silver data v<1% of total generated synthetic data by ICL.\\nFor fine-tuning, we have used a linear scheduler with AdamW(Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) as the\\noptimizer, with learning_rate=2e-5 & batch_size=8.

Notably, our approach uses a\\npre-trained LLM for generation with no fine-tuning (FT), utilizing just a single\\nannotated example in ICL to generate data, providing a cost-effective development\\nprocess.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nWhile LLMs like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) can answer questions from text, they are computationally\\nexpensive and incur huge costs to run at low latency and high throughput. A common alternative is to\\nuse a small encoder-only models like BERT(Devlin et al., 2019) or XLM-R(Conneau et al., 2019) for\\nextractive QA. However, these smaller models rely on a large quantity of annotated data which is\\nscarce and difficult to obtain, especially for multilingual and domain-specific settings. In the absence\\nof annotated data, synthetic data generation has recently been effective at overcoming scarcity of\\nlabeled data for applications including extractive QA (Alberti et al., 2019).\\n* First authors, Equal Contribution\\n\\u2020 Mentors for this research: Provided strategic vision and offered technical feedback.\\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"Figure 1: 1-Shot example prompts used to generate Spanish and Hindi synthetic data respectively\\non AlexaTM 20B model using ICL. Prompt instructions are mentioned in English and data is in the\\ntarget language. For readability, instruction part has been bolded & italicized. An example synthetic\\nQ&A pair generated from model presented under Result header.\\nTeaching via Data (TvD)(Rosenbaum et al., 2023) involves using a LLM-based teacher model to\\ngenerate synthetic training data for a specific task, which is used to fine-tune a smaller student model.\\nThe challenge is that LLMs, while capable of generating data, lack domain-specific training, and the\\ntask representation remains incomplete due to limited examples in ICL. This results in lower data\\nquality compared to annotated data. As demonstrated in (Shakeri et al., 2021), generative models\\nenable task-specific, cross-lingual data generation through fine-tuning on a single language. However,\\nthis process is expensive due to the large number of parameters involved in fine-tuning LLMs. In this\\npaper, we focus on generating high-quality synthetic data in low-resource scenarios without the need\\nfor teacher model fine-tuning. We propose to apply AlexaTM 20B (Soltan et al., 2022) to generate\\nsynthetic question answering data by prompting the model with a 1 shot in-context example, and\\nwe apply a semi supervised approach based on WeakDAP (Chen et al., 2022) on the student model\\nXLM-R-Base to identify high quality examples from generated data and incrementally improve the\\nperformance. While we use AlexaTM 20B as our teacher, this is a generalised framework which can\\nbe applied to data generated from any LLM and for any type of task.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nQuestion-Answer pair generation (QAG) has been mostly taken as two independent tasks: given a\\ncontext to perform Question Generation (QG) and then a Question Answering task (QA). The context\\nused for QG are employed in cross lingual solutions such as generating in English first and then\\ntranslated using machine translation (MT) into the required language, where (Li and Callison-Burch,\\n2023) did this using alignment, while (Fabbri et al., 2020) have also looked into template based\\ngeneration for specific domains. On the other hand (Riabi et al., 2021) have looked into generating\\nthe synthetic data in the target language directly. One difference with such works, is that GeMQuAD\\ndoesn\\u2019t rely on MT and parallel corpora as we are using multilingual models. QA can be seen as the\\ncounterpart of the QG problem, as demonstrated by (Kramchaninova and Defauw, 2022) in utilizing\\ncontext-based candidate answers to create questions. Prior work (Shakeri et al., 2021) assesses\\nQuestion & Answer (Q&A) quality through automatic evaluations, while (Riabi et al., 2021) and\\n(Agrawal et al., 2023) have considered downstream QA tasks to quantify their performance.\\nQAMELEON (Agrawal et al., 2023) the most recent related work to ours, also addressed this\\nproblem by treating Q&A generation as a single task. We believe this approach has the potential for\\nbetter growth compared to treating it as two separate tasks, as it preserves the dependency between\\nquestions and answers. Similar to us, QAMELEON proposes using LLMs to generate synthetic\\nQ&A pairs via ICL with 5 golden samples, which they then use to fine-tune a QA model to evaluate\\ntheir contributions. The core concept of QAMELEON involves Prompt Tuning (PT) their LLM\\n2\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"(PaLM-540B Chowdhery et al. (2022)) for the QA task to generate high quality data and evaluate\\ntheir approach on mt5-XL Xue et al. (2021). Prompt Tuning (PT) is a parameter efficient fine\\ntuning technique that learns and updates the model parameters specific to input prompt only rather\\nthan updating the entire LLM parameters. From a computational perspective, while PT is more\\neffective than FT, it still involves tuning the LLM like PaLM 540B which is of high computational\\ncost. QAMELEON also claims their acheived performance is tied to the base LLM model used i.e.,\\nPaLM 540B. However, we believe that using an LLM as large as PaLM is not feasible in low-budget\\nscenarios. Our GeMQuAD approach is a generalised framework which can be applied to any type of\\nsynthetic data, to get high quality pairs from the overall generated dataset. We experimented with\\nsmaller models with a consideration on low-cost execution, with no fine-tuning of the generation\\nmodels, and we are utilizing an iterative approach to develop on our synthetic data as compared to\\nutilizing all the synthetic data generated. To compare our results with QAMELEON, we were unable\\nto replicate the generation strategy because PaLM-540B is a closed model, and the languages in the\\nreleased QAMELEON dataset do not overlap with our targeted languages.\\n3\\nMethodology\\nTo improve multilingual performance of the downstream Extractive QA task, our approach consists\\nof 3 major steps. 1) Generate synthetic question answer data using 1-shot ICL on AlexaTM 20B\\n(teacher) model; 2) Apply our semi-supervised learning approach to filter good quality records; 3)\\nfine-tune student model XLM-R-Base with filtered data from step 2. We apply steps 2 & 3 iteratively\\nuntil model performance stops improving for a maximum of k=2 rounds.\\n3.1\\nSynthetic Data Generation using ICL\\nFigure 1 shows the prompt design used for generating data on AlexaTM 20B using ICL. [CLM] is\\na special token which the model expects during in-context learning. Instruction provides guideline\\nfor model to understand that Question and Answer should be generated from the Context which is\\ndemonstrated in the 1-shot example. The test context is added after the example. The model learns\\nto generate the question and answer from the test context, in the same format demonstrated in the\\nexample. More details on ICL configuration used is mentioned in the Experimental Setup section.\\nFigure 2: The semi-supervised fine-tuning approach of student using the data generated from teacher.\\nData generation is a one-time step in which an LLM (AlexaTM) is utilized to create synthetic data\\nusing few-shot learning. The data is then passed to the Data Filtering & Model Tuning stage, where it\\niteratively filters high-quality records and enhances the labeling model through fine-tuning student\\n(XLM-R-base) until optimal performance is achieved, based on predetermined stopping criteria.\\n3.2\\nSemi-supervised learning approach\\nWe are generating data in a low-resource setting, i.e., 1-shot learning. The model generated synthetic\\ndata would be of lower quality compared to annotated data. While quality checks can be added to\\nexclude the low quality pairs as part of post processing step, these checks are limited to deterministic\\nand structural validations only. As part of the post-processing, we verify that the answer is a part of\\nthe context, and remove any duplicate Q&A pairs from the dataset.\\nTo identify good quality functional pairs, we extend the WeakDAP approach with our customization\\nto fine-tuning the student model XLM-R-base for filtering out the correctly generated synthetic data.\\nAs shown in Figure 2, the workflow begins with the generation of synthetic data in the target language\\n3\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"from the teacher model via ICL using the format shown in Figure 1. Once the data generation is\\ncomplete, a weak labeler evaluates the synthetic data for the Extractive QA task. Given a (context,\\nquestion) tuple as input, the labeler predicts the answer span within the respective context.\\nIn our experiments, we initially use our baseline model as the weak labeler, which is trained on\\nEnglish annotated data corpus (Gold data) for Extractive QA task. As the labeler has not seen any data\\nin target language during training, the Extractive QA performance of the model on target language\\nis limited, and mainly relies on the cross-lingual transfer ability of the base model on which it is\\nfine-tuned. From the synthetic dataset, any questions where our labeler is able to provide the same\\nanswer as generated by the teacher model can be considered of high quality and relevant to the\\ncontext. Consequently, all the Q&A pairs that the labeler accurately generates based on the synthetic\\ndata answer labels are filtered and added to the silver dataset.\\n3.3\\nStudent model fine-tuning\\nThe student model gets fine-tuned first on the data filtered from semi-supervised approach (silver\\ndata) and then on the gold data. This is to prioritize the higher quality data in the later part of the\\nFT which we find improves the model performance. Similar analysis is reported by (Riabi et al.,\\n2021) too in their works. Student model performance is improved due to the addition of new silver\\ndata in target language, now we replace weak labeler with improved model, and perform synthetic\\ndata evaluation again. Since the labeler is an improved version compared to its previous iterations,\\nit would be able to identify few more good quality Q&A pairs from the synthetic dataset which\\nincreases the volume of silver data. This process continues iteratively until the model performance\\ndoesn\\u2019t improve for k rounds by minimum of e threshold (or) the new silver data volume in that\\niteration is less than v% of the total generated synthetic data. The k, e, v values are tunable.\\n4\\nExperimentation\\n4.1\\nDatasets\\nWe have used multiple datasets as part of the experimental analysis. In synthetic data generation\\nusing ICL, we used the first ten records from the XQUAD (Artetxe et al., 2020) dataset for Hindi\\nand Spanish labeled examples in our 1-shot ICL prompts. To generate synthetic Q&A pairs, we used\\ncontext from the XTREME (Hu et al., 2020) \\u2019translate-dev\\u2019 split. Our student model was trained\\nand validated using the English extractive QA data from SQUAD v1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). To\\nassess the student model\\u2019s performance on multilingual QA tasks, we utilize two evaluation datasets:\\nthe MLQA (Lewis et al., 2019) dataset and the remaining 1180 records from the XQUAD dataset,\\nexcluding the first 10 records. All of these datasets are human-annotated except XTREME, which\\nrelies on machine translation. Further details on datasets can be found in Appendix\\n4.2\\nExperimental Setup\\n4.2.1\\nICL Configuration\\nTo perform 1-shot learning on AlexaTM, we have used 10 annotated examples from XQUAD dataset\\nfor both Hindi and Spanish data generation, and generated Q&A pairs for contexts from the XTREME\\ndataset. We randomly pick 1 example to create the input prompt to make sure our generation process is\\nrandomised and diversified. On the ICL configuration, we have used sampling approach (do_sample=\\nTrue), with the temperature set to 0.9, and randomly picked top_k & top_p ranging between 50 to 100\\nand 0.5 to 0.95 respectively for each example to increase the generalisation in the generated records.\\nThe max_length is set to 50 tokens to control generation length.\\n4.2.2\\nFine-tuning Configuration\\nWe use the pretrained XLM-R-base (Conneau et al., 2019) as our student model, fine-tuning it on\\nthe QA task with generated synthetic data & evaluate its performance on both MLQA & XQUAD\\ndatasets. MLQA and XQUAD datasets are both open-domain QA datasets. Therefore, we generated\\nsynthetic data only once using the test contexts from XTREME and did not create any synthetic\\ndata specific to these datasets. Across all experiments, we consistently use a fixed sample subset\\n4\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"of 10,000 records from the SQUAD dataset as gold data, which we refer to as \\u2019SQUADen10k\\u2019, to\\nmaintain consistency in English annotated dataset size with the generated synthetic datasets.\\nAlong with semi-supervised approach (XLMRbgemquad ), we experimented on the configurations of\\nusing the synthetic data in fine-tuning the student model, with XLMRbcombined being the model where\\nwe fine-tune it only once on the combined dataset of synthetic data and the SQUADen10k subset,\\nwhile XLMRbsequential being the model which is first fine-tuned on complete synthetic data and then\\nfine-tuned on the SQUADen10k (similar to our fine-tuning approach but without the semi-supervised\\nfiltering). For baseline comparison, we evaluated our approach against two models. XLMRbbaseline\\nwas fine-tuned solely on the SQUADen10k subset. We compared our approach with data augmentation\\nusing machine translation (MT) (Hu et al., 2020), XLMRbMT was fine-tuned on a combined dataset\\nthat included SQUADen10k, as well as its machine-translated version of Hindi and Spanish data.\\nXLMRbbaseline is also the initial version of our weak labeler in semi supervised filtering approach.\\nWe run loops of iterations, where in each iteration we fine-tune student model on batches of silver\\ndata filtered by labeler and SQUADen10k. The improved model in the current iteration evaluates the\\nsynthetic data to predict the answers for the given (context, question) pairs, and accordingly classify\\nthe synthetic sample as a correctly generated example if the answers match or otherwise. The batch\\nof synthetic samples that are classified as correctly generated in the current iteration by our student\\nmodel, are included in silver data for fine-tuning the student model in next iteration. Iterations are\\nstopped if the improvement in model QA task performance for k=2 rounds by threshold e<0.005 or\\nthe new sample batch volume added to silver data v<1% of total generated synthetic data by ICL.\\nFor fine-tuning, we have used a linear scheduler with AdamW(Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) as the\\noptimizer, with learning_rate=2e-5 & batch_size=8. To maintain the consistency of our results\\nacross our experiments, we alter the epochs for each experiment so that we have similar number of\\ntraining update steps so as to make sure the models in each experiment go through similar amount of\\ntraining in all iterations\\/experiments. Therefore, any performance changes (taking into account slight\\nfluctuations) relate to the data, validates the use of synthetic data, regardless of its size. We use the\\nbest performing epoch according to the validation set in training as our final model at each iteration.\\n5\\nResults\\nModel\\nEnglish\\nHindi\\nSpanish\\nAverage\\nXLMRbbaseline\\n74.73 \\/ 61.04\\n55.04 \\/ 37.09\\n61.04 \\/ 40.00\\n55.99 \\/ 40.74\\nXLMRbMT\\n75.85 \\/ 62.12\\n59.87 \\/ 41.91\\n64.03\\/ 42.32\\n58.48 \\/ 42.91\\nXLMRbcombined\\n75.17 \\/ 61.51\\n51.27 \\/ 37.17\\n58.53 \\/ 39.52\\n54.95 \\/ 41.17\\nXLMRbsequential\\n76.17 \\/ 62.40\\n59.67 \\/ 43.51\\n64.73 \\/ 43.44\\n59.38 \\/ 44.36\\nXLMRbgemquad\\n76.33 \\/ 62.66\\n60.09 \\/ 43.59\\n64.85 \\/ 43.69\\n59.81 \\/ 44.63\\nTable 1: Performance in QA task for FT with synthetic Hindi & Spanish data along with SQUADen10k\\nsubset.

Figure 4 depicts the\\nnumber of synthetic data samples classified as correct in each iteration of both Hindi and Spanish\\nexperiments.

There was no further improvement in 4th and 5th iterations, leading us to stop the iterations\\nwith the criterion of k=2.

While English saw a slight performance increase, over-\\nall, Hindi and Spanish performance declined. We suspect that by fine-tuning on both synthetic and\\nSQUADen10k together, we may be inadvertently misdirecting the model by giving same importance to\\nall samples. Consequently, we experimented with the XLMRbsequential configuration, fine-tuning each\\ndataset separately, giving priority to SQUADen10k due to its later fine-tuning which is working better.\\nHigh-quality, smaller datasets outperform low-quality, large-volume data XLMRbgemquad out-\\nperformed XLMRbMT which involves more data samples than semi-supervised approach. Also, by\\nselecting high quality data pairs from overall dataset worked better than using the entire synthetic\\ndataset generated through ICL (XLMRbsequential)\\nFrom our evaluation above, overall GeMQuAD outperformed XLMRbcombined by an improvement\\nof 5.3\\/4.6 F1\\/EM (Average performance across all languages in both MLQA & XQUAD datasets)\\nand XLMRbsequential by 0.5\\/0.5 F1\\/EM.

Typically, there are four fundamental\\nDue to the rich usage of applications, numerous research efforts have been made on ABSA to predict or extract fne-grained sentiment elements (Jiao et al., 2019; Pontiki et al., 2014, 2015, 2016; Zhang et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2021). Based on the number of sentimental elements to be extracted, existing studies can be categorized into the following tasks: (1) single term extraction includes aspect term extraction (ATE) (Li and Lam, 2017; He et al., 2017), aspect category detection (ACD) (He et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021); (2) pair extraction includes aspect-opinion pairwise extraction (AOPE) (Yu et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020), aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) (Cai et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2020), and\\nEnd-to-End ABSA (E2E-ABSA) (Li et al., 2019b; He et al., 2019) to extract the aspect and its sentiment; (3) triplet extraction includes aspectsentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) (Mukherjee et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021), and Target Aspect Sentiment Detection (TASD) (Wan et al., 2020); (4) quadruple extraction includes aspectcategory-opinion-sentiment (ACOS) quadruple extraction (Cai et al., 2021) and aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) (Zhang et al., 2021a). ACOS and ASQP are the same tasks, which aim to extract all aspect-category-opinion-sentiment quadruples per sample. Since ASQP covers the whole task name, we use ASQP to denote the ABSA quadruple extraction task. Table 1 summarizes an example of the outputs of various ABSA tasks.\\nThis paper focuses on ASQP because it provides a complete aspect-level sentiment analysis (Zhang et al., 2022). We frst observe that existing ASQP datasets are crawled from only one source and are small with low-density (Cai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021a). For example, the maximum sample size is around 4,000, while the maximum number of quadruples per sample is around 1.6. This limits the technical development of ASQP. Second, ASQP includes two extraction subtasks (aspect extraction and opinion extraction) and two classifcation subtasks (category classifcation and sentiment classifcation). Modeling the four subtasks simultaneously is challenging, especially when the quadruples contain implicit aspects or opinions (Cai et al., 2021). Though existing studies can resolve ASQP via pipeline-based (Cai et al., 2021) or generation-based methods (Zhang et al., 2021a; Mao et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2022), they suffer from different shortcomings, i.e., pipeline-based methods tend to yield error propagation while generation-based methods perform slowly in training and inference.\\nTo tackle the above challenges, we frst construct two datasets, en-Phone and zh-FoodBeverage, to expand the capacity of datasets. en-Phone is an English ASQP dataset in the cell phone domain collected from several e-commercial platforms, while zh-FoodBeverage is the frst Chinese ASQP dataset collected from multiple sources under the categories of Food and Beverage. Compared to the existing ASQP datasets, our datasets have 1.75 to 4.19 times more samples and a higher quadruple density of 1.3 to 1.8. This achievement is a result of our meticulous defnition and adherence to annotation guidelines, which allow us to obtain more fne-grained quadruples.\\n\\nAfter investigating strong ASQP baselines, we observed a decline in performance on our newly released dataset. This fnding, coupled with the shortcomings of the existing baselines, motivated us to develop a novel one-step solution for ASQP, namely One-ASQP. As illustrated in Fig. 1, our One-ASQP adopts a shared encoder from a pretrained language model (LM) and resolves two tasks, aspect category detection (ACD) and aspectopinion-sentiment co-extraction (AOSC) simultaneously. ACD is implemented by a multi-class classifer and AOSC is fulflled by a token-pair-based two-dimensional (2D) matrix with the sentimentspecifc horns tagging schema, a popular technique borrowed from the joint entity and relation extraction (Wang et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2022). The two tasks are trained independently and simultaneously, allowing us to avoid error propagation and overcome slow training and inferring in generationbased methods. Moreover, we also design a unique token, \\u201c[NULL]\\u201d, appending at the beginning of the input, which can help us to identify implicit aspects or opinions effectively.\\nOur contributions are three-fold: (1) We construct two new ASQP datasets consisting of more fne-grained samples with higher quadruple density while covering more domains and languages. Signifcantly, the released zh-FoodBeverage dataset is the frst Chinese ASQP dataset, which provides opportunities to investigate potential technologies in a multi-lingual context for ASQP. (2) We propose One-ASQP to simultaneously detect aspect categories and co-extract aspect-opinion-sentiment triplets. One-ASQP can absorb deeper interactions between sentiment elements without error propagation and conquer slow performance in generationbased methods. Moreover, the delicately designed \\u201c[NULL]\\u201d token helps us to identify implicit aspects or opinions effectively. (3) We conducted extensive experiments demonstrating that One-ASQP is effcient and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in certain scenarios.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"ABSA Benchmark Datasets are mainly provided by the SemEval\\u201914-16 shared challenges (Pontiki et al., 2014, 2015, 2016). The initial task is only to identify opinions expressed about specifc entities and their aspects. In order to investigate more tasks, such as AOPE, E2E-ABSA, ASTE, TASD, and ASQP, researchers have re-annotated the datasets and constructed some new ones (Fan et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019a; Xu et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2021). However, re-annotated datasets still contain the following limitations: (1) The data is collected from only one source, limiting the scope of the data; (2) the data size is usually small, where the maximum one is only around 4,000; (3) there is only a labeled quadruple per sentence and many samples share a common aspect, which makes the task easier; (4) the available public datasets are all in English. The shortcomings of existing benchmark datasets motivate us to crawl and curate more data from more domains, covering more languages and with higher quadruple density.\\n\\nASQP aims to predict the four sentiment elements to provide a complete aspect-level sentiment structure (Cai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021a). The task is extended to several variants, e.g., capturing the quadruple of holder-target-expression-polarity (R et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022) or the quadruple of target-aspect-opinion-sentiment in a dialogue (Li et al., 2022). Existing studies can be divided into the pipeline or generation paradigm. A typical pipeline-based work (Cai et al., 2021) has investigated different techniques to solve the subtasks accordingly. It consits of (1) frst exploiting double propagation (DP) (Qiu et al., 2011) or JET (Xu et al., 2020) to extract the aspect-opinion-sentiment triplets and after that, detecting the aspect category to output the fnal quadruples; (2) frst utilizing TAS-BERT (Wan et al., 2020) and the ExtractClassify scheme (Wang et al., 2017) to perform the aspect-opinion co-extraction and predicting category-sentiment afterward. Most studies fall in the generation paradigm (Zhang et al., 2021a; Mao et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2021a) is the frst generationbased method to predict the sentiment quads in an end-to-end manner via a PARAPHRASE modeling paradigm. It has been extended and overcome by Seq2Path (Mao et al., 2022) or tree-structure generation (Mao et al., 2022; Bao et al., 2022) to tackle the generation order issue or capture more information. Prompt-based generative methods are proposed to assemble multiple tasks as LEGO bricks to attain task transfer (Gao et al., 2022) or tackle few-shot learning (Varia et al., 2022). GENSCL-NAT (Peper and Wang, 2022) is introduced to exploit supervised contrastive learning and a new structured generation format to improve the naturalness of the output sequences for ASQP. However, existing methods either yield error propagation in the pipeline-based methods or slow computation in the generation-based methods. The shortcomings of existing methods motivate us to propose One-ASQP.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\\u25a1\\u0013 A1. Did you describe the limitations of your work? Limitations   \\n\\u25a1\\u0013 A2.

Languages falling between the two thresholds are\\nclassified as medium-resource languages. Scores of 0, 1, and 2 are assigned to low, medium, and\\nhigh resource languages, respectively, with higher scores indicating greater data scarcity. (2) Re-\\ngarding grammatical complexity, each language is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 using GPT-4, reflecting\\nthe level of difficulty from easy to hard. (3) Then the language difficulty metric is computed by\\nsumming the scores derived from resource availability and grammatical complexity. During train-\\ning, languages are categorized as easy, medium, and hard based on their language difficulty scores,\\nmaintaining the same distribution of high, medium, and low resource languages. Next, we train\\nLingual-SMoEextra with the language difficulty groups in the OPUS-16 settings and compare it\\nto the dense and SMoE baselines. As shown in Table S1, Lingual-SMoEextra consistently out-\\nperforms the baseline models due to the incorporation of both grammar and data information. The\\nreason why we exclude language difficulty when combining the grammar complexity score and the\\ndata availability score is twofold. First, the amount of data is an objective metric, but grammar com-\\nplexity is relatively subjective for people with different first languages and education levels. Also,\\nthe definition of grammar complexity varies from GPT to human, and even from case to case within\\nGPT.

Table 3\\nshows these numbers along with volumes of other dataset used in our analysis. Figure 4 depicts the\\nnumber of synthetic data samples classified as correct in each iteration of both Hindi and Spanish\\nexperiments. We find that we start with a large share of the samples, of roughly 30% of the total data,\\nbut only gradually add on as we proceed in iterations. This is expected because we only want the\\nbest samples, so these are more prone to be selected in the earlier iterations. We are finally able to\\nutilize roughly 45% of the generated data for our usecase. We achieved our best performance in 3rd\\niteration. There was no further improvement in 4th and 5th iterations, leading us to stop the iterations\\nwith the criterion of k=2. More details on iteration-wise performance is provided in the Appendix.\\nSynthetic data helps in performance With our proposed approach(XLMRbgemquad), we observe\\nsimilar improvements across both datasets. On MLQA, we find 3.82\\/3.89 (F1\\/EM) points of im-\\nprovement compared to XLMRbbaseline, with improvement of 5.05\\/6.50 & 3.81\\/3.69 points in Hindi\\n& Spanish respectively. On XQUAD, we achieved overall improvement of 3.1\\/3.95 points, with\\nimprovement of 6.61\\/7.03 & 2.50\\/3.47 points in Hindi & Spanish respectively which concludes that\\nhaving new synthetic examples improves the performance.\\nSequentially fine-tuning on separate datasets works better Fine-tuning configuration\\nXLMRbcombined yielded mixed results. While English saw a slight performance increase, over-\\nall, Hindi and Spanish performance declined. We suspect that by fine-tuning on both synthetic and\\nSQUADen10k together, we may be inadvertently misdirecting the model by giving same importance to\\nall samples. Consequently, we experimented with the XLMRbsequential configuration, fine-tuning each\\ndataset separately, giving priority to SQUADen10k due to its later fine-tuning which is working better.\\nHigh-quality, smaller datasets outperform low-quality, large-volume data XLMRbgemquad out-\\nperformed XLMRbMT which involves more data samples than semi-supervised approach. Also, by\\nselecting high quality data pairs from overall dataset worked better than using the entire synthetic\\ndataset generated through ICL (XLMRbsequential)\\nFrom our evaluation above, overall GeMQuAD outperformed XLMRbcombined by an improvement\\nof 5.3\\/4.6 F1\\/EM (Average performance across all languages in both MLQA & XQUAD datasets)\\nand XLMRbsequential by 0.5\\/0.5 F1\\/EM. On the baselines, our approach works better than machine\\ntranslation XLMRbMT by 1.2\\/1.9 F1\\/EM, while using only English annotated data XLMRbbaseline by\\n3.5\\/3.9 F1\\/EM. In short, GeMQuAD > sequential (0.5\\/0.5) > MT (1.2\\/1.9) > baseline\\n(3.5\\/3.9) > combined (5.3\\/4.6).\\nWe observed good improvements in languages that are not included in the student model\\u2019s fine-tuning\\ndata, such as German, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Chinese.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nQuestion-Answer pair generation (QAG) has been mostly taken as two independent tasks: given a\\ncontext to perform Question Generation (QG) and then a Question Answering task (QA). The context\\nused for QG are employed in cross lingual solutions such as generating in English first and then\\ntranslated using machine translation (MT) into the required language, where (Li and Callison-Burch,\\n2023) did this using alignment, while (Fabbri et al., 2020) have also looked into template based\\ngeneration for specific domains. On the other hand (Riabi et al., 2021) have looked into generating\\nthe synthetic data in the target language directly. One difference with such works, is that GeMQuAD\\ndoesn\\u2019t rely on MT and parallel corpora as we are using multilingual models. QA can be seen as the\\ncounterpart of the QG problem, as demonstrated by (Kramchaninova and Defauw, 2022) in utilizing\\ncontext-based candidate answers to create questions. Prior work (Shakeri et al., 2021) assesses\\nQuestion & Answer (Q&A) quality through automatic evaluations, while (Riabi et al., 2021) and\\n(Agrawal et al., 2023) have considered downstream QA tasks to quantify their performance.\\nQAMELEON (Agrawal et al., 2023) the most recent related work to ours, also addressed this\\nproblem by treating Q&A generation as a single task. We believe this approach has the potential for\\nbetter growth compared to treating it as two separate tasks, as it preserves the dependency between\\nquestions and answers. Similar to us, QAMELEON proposes using LLMs to generate synthetic\\nQ&A pairs via ICL with 5 golden samples, which they then use to fine-tune a QA model to evaluate\\ntheir contributions. The core concept of QAMELEON involves Prompt Tuning (PT) their LLM\\n2\\n(PaLM-540B Chowdhery et al. (2022)) for the QA task to generate high quality data and evaluate\\ntheir approach on mt5-XL Xue et al. (2021). Prompt Tuning (PT) is a parameter efficient fine\\ntuning technique that learns and updates the model parameters specific to input prompt only rather\\nthan updating the entire LLM parameters. From a computational perspective, while PT is more\\neffective than FT, it still involves tuning the LLM like PaLM 540B which is of high computational\\ncost. QAMELEON also claims their acheived performance is tied to the base LLM model used i.e.,\\nPaLM 540B. However, we believe that using an LLM as large as PaLM is not feasible in low-budget\\nscenarios. Our GeMQuAD approach is a generalised framework which can be applied to any type of\\nsynthetic data, to get high quality pairs from the overall generated dataset. We experimented with\\nsmaller models with a consideration on low-cost execution, with no fine-tuning of the generation\\nmodels, and we are utilizing an iterative approach to develop on our synthetic data as compared to\\nutilizing all the synthetic data generated. To compare our results with QAMELEON, we were unable\\nto replicate the generation strategy because PaLM-540B is a closed model, and the languages in the\\nreleased QAMELEON dataset do not overlap with our targeted languages.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Results\\nModel\\nEnglish\\nHindi\\nSpanish\\nAverage\\nXLMRbbaseline\\n74.73 \\/ 61.04\\n55.04 \\/ 37.09\\n61.04 \\/ 40.00\\n55.99 \\/ 40.74\\nXLMRbMT\\n75.85 \\/ 62.12\\n59.87 \\/ 41.91\\n64.03\\/ 42.32\\n58.48 \\/ 42.91\\nXLMRbcombined\\n75.17 \\/ 61.51\\n51.27 \\/ 37.17\\n58.53 \\/ 39.52\\n54.95 \\/ 41.17\\nXLMRbsequential\\n76.17 \\/ 62.40\\n59.67 \\/ 43.51\\n64.73 \\/ 43.44\\n59.38 \\/ 44.36\\nXLMRbgemquad\\n76.33 \\/ 62.66\\n60.09 \\/ 43.59\\n64.85 \\/ 43.69\\n59.81 \\/ 44.63\\nTable 1: Performance in QA task for FT with synthetic Hindi & Spanish data along with SQUADen10k\\nsubset.

Table 3\\nshows these numbers along with volumes of other dataset used in our analysis. Figure 4 depicts the\\nnumber of synthetic data samples classified as correct in each iteration of both Hindi and Spanish\\nexperiments. We find that we start with a large share of the samples, of roughly 30% of the total data,\\nbut only gradually add on as we proceed in iterations. This is expected because we only want the\\nbest samples, so these are more prone to be selected in the earlier iterations. We are finally able to\\nutilize roughly 45% of the generated data for our usecase. We achieved our best performance in 3rd\\niteration. There was no further improvement in 4th and 5th iterations, leading us to stop the iterations\\nwith the criterion of k=2. More details on iteration-wise performance is provided in the Appendix.\\nSynthetic data helps in performance With our proposed approach(XLMRbgemquad), we observe\\nsimilar improvements across both datasets. On MLQA, we find 3.82\\/3.89 (F1\\/EM) points of im-\\nprovement compared to XLMRbbaseline, with improvement of 5.05\\/6.50 & 3.81\\/3.69 points in Hindi\\n& Spanish respectively. On XQUAD, we achieved overall improvement of 3.1\\/3.95 points, with\\nimprovement of 6.61\\/7.03 & 2.50\\/3.47 points in Hindi & Spanish respectively which concludes that\\nhaving new synthetic examples improves the performance.\\nSequentially fine-tuning on separate datasets works better Fine-tuning configuration\\nXLMRbcombined yielded mixed results. While English saw a slight performance increase, over-\\nall, Hindi and Spanish performance declined. We suspect that by fine-tuning on both synthetic and\\nSQUADen10k together, we may be inadvertently misdirecting the model by giving same importance to\\nall samples. Consequently, we experimented with the XLMRbsequential configuration, fine-tuning each\\ndataset separately, giving priority to SQUADen10k due to its later fine-tuning which is working better.\\nHigh-quality, smaller datasets outperform low-quality, large-volume data XLMRbgemquad out-\\nperformed XLMRbMT which involves more data samples than semi-supervised approach. Also, by\\nselecting high quality data pairs from overall dataset worked better than using the entire synthetic\\ndataset generated through ICL (XLMRbsequential)\\nFrom our evaluation above, overall GeMQuAD outperformed XLMRbcombined by an improvement\\nof 5.3\\/4.6 F1\\/EM (Average performance across all languages in both MLQA & XQUAD datasets)\\nand XLMRbsequential by 0.5\\/0.5 F1\\/EM. On the baselines, our approach works better than machine\\ntranslation XLMRbMT by 1.2\\/1.9 F1\\/EM, while using only English annotated data XLMRbbaseline by\\n3.5\\/3.9 F1\\/EM. In short, GeMQuAD > sequential (0.5\\/0.5) > MT (1.2\\/1.9) > baseline\\n(3.5\\/3.9) > combined (5.3\\/4.6).\\nWe observed good improvements in languages that are not included in the student model\\u2019s fine-tuning\\ndata, such as German, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Chinese.
