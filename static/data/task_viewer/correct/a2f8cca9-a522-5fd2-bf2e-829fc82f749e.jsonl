{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2 Evaluation Metrics\",\"section_content\":\"We focus on evaluating the unlearned models from 1) Performance on the Forget Set: The model should not be able to predict correctly on the forget set, or its performance should degrade to the same level as the test set.\\n2) Performance on the Retain Set: Ideally, the model\\u2019s performance on this set should not degrade signifcantly, indicating that the unlearning process did not adversely affect the data it should remember. The performance assessment is conducted by measuring the model\\u2019s accuracy and perplexity on both the forget and retain sets.\\n3) Performance on General Downstream Tasks: We can evaluate the performance on some general downstream tasks, which can provide insights into the model\\u2019s overall capability post-unlearning. The model\\u2019s performance on these tasks is expected not to downgrade too much compared with the model before unlearning. The downstream tasks considered include Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) (Hendrycks et al., 2021), the ARC Challenge (Clark et al., 2018), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), and Grade School Math (GSM8K) (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n\\nApproximate Retraining. To attain ideal unlearning outcomes, one can retrain from scratch to exclude the specifed sequences $\\\\mathcal{U}$ . This exact unlearning approach is considered as the \\u201cgold standard\\u201d for evaluating approximate unlearning effcacy, as highlighted in the prior work (Liu et al., 2024). However, retraining LLMs on the entire retained dataset $\\\\mathcal{D}\\\\backslash\\\\mathcal{U}$ is impractical due to substantial computational resource requirements.\\n\\nTo circumvent this, we introduce a surrogate evaluation approach called approximate retraining, which is inspired by membership inference attacks (Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2022) that identify performance gaps between the training and unseen data. We thus hypothesize that the retrained model will exhibit consistent performance on unseen domain-specifc data, albeit inferior to its performance on trained data. Given the signifcant imbalance between pre-training and unlearning data volumes, we expect the retrained model\\u2019s performance on unseen data within unlearned data distributions to closely align with the original (vanilla) model\\u2019s performance. Consequently, by collecting new data from the same domain as the forget set to create an \\\"approximate set,\\\" we estimate the retrained model\\u2019s performance on the forget set by the vanilla model\\u2019s performance on this approximate set. This estimation can further guide the extent of approximate unlearning, including factors such as the learning rate or optimization steps. This approximate set can be easily obtained from the test set of the LLM for its developer or from the open-source community4 for all researchers across several domains.\\n\\nMembership Inference Attack. The complexity of LLMs precludes straightforward interpretable verifcation of the complete exclusion of specifc sequences from the vanilla model. To address this, we employ Membership Inference Attack (MIA) to ascertain whether particular sequences are erased from the LLM\\u2019s training dataset. This evaluation employs the Min- ${\\\\bf K}\\\\%$ Prob method (Shi et al., 2023), which operates on the premise that non-member examples are more prone to containing outlier words with notably high negative loglikelihood values, in contrast to member examples. An important variable affecting the effcacy of MIA is the percentage of tokens with minimal prediction probability; thus, we conduct experiments across various percentages, selecting the one yielding the highest detection performance for each model. The sequence length is set to be 4096 tokens for both member (chunked from the forget set) and nonmember (equivalent number of chunks from the approximate set) datasets. The effectiveness of MIA was quantitatively assessed using the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. Notably, a higher AUC indicates that the targeted sequence is still identifable within the training set, whereas a score approaching 0.5, indicative of random guess result, suggests superior unlearning effectiveness.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.4 Results\",\"section_content\":\"We report and analyze the results for unlearning arXiv papers, GitHub code repositories, and books. Given that approximate retraining serves as an optimal target for unlearning, we adjust the learning rate of each experiment to align the results with those achieved through approximate retraining. The number of unlearning epochs is 1. All the experiments are conducted using 8 A800 GPUs.\\nUnlearning academic papers from arXiv. We task the pre-trained Yi-6B to unlearn 500 academic papers randomly selected from its training data within the arXiv domain. This procedure simulates scenarios in which authors wish to safeguard their proprietary knowledge or unique writing styles. The unlearning performance is shown in Table 1.\\nThe vanilla model exhibits close performance on both the forget set and unseen approximate data, with perplexity values of 3.65 and 3.69, respectively, demonstrating the model has good generalization capabilities within the arXiv domain. Compared with the vanilla model, unlearned models exhibit a slight decline in next token prediction accuracy (e.g., from $69.02\\\\%$ to $68.79\\\\%$ after gradient ascent), signifying increased diffculty in token extraction given preceding tokens as prompts. Notably, only the model subjected to unlearning through a combination of gradient ascent and gradient descent exhibited reduced perplexity on the retain set. This outcome can be attributed to the model learning on a general dataset sampled from the same distribution as the retain set while unlearning the forget set. Furthermore, gradient ascent emerges as the sole method to enhance average accuracy across downstream tasks post-unlearning, underscoring its superiority in maintaining the model\\u2019s overall utility.\\n\\nBoth the MIA AUC scores before and after unlearning are close to 0.5. This result aligns with a recent study (Duan et al., 2024), which indicates that current MIA methods struggle to differentiate between member and non-member data in LLMs. Despite this general diffculty, our results demonstrate a decrease in MIA AUC scores after unlearning. This indicates that it becomes more challenging to differentiate between the forget set and unseen data, suggesting that our unlearning methods are effective in reducing privacy leakage related to membership inference.\\nUnlearning programming code from GitHub repositories. We request the pre-trained Yi-6B to unlearn 2000 GitHub code fles randomly selected from its training data. This simulates scenarios where developers or organizations seek to remove specifc coding patterns, algorithms, or proprietary code from the model\\u2019s knowledge base, ensuring that their intellectual property remains protected. The unlearning results are displayed in Table 2.\\nThe vanilla model exhibits a more pronounced disparity in performance between the forget set and the unseen approximate set for GitHub code, indicating inferior generalization capabilities compared to the arXiv domain. A notable decline in the HumanEval pass $@1$ score is observed for models unlearned through fne-tuning with random labels, unlearning with adversarial samples, and gradient ascent combined with gradient descent on indistribution data. Given that HumanEval is a metric specifcally designed to assess the code-generating profciency of LLMs (Chen et al., 2021), this substantial decrease underscores the detrimental impact of these three methods on the model\\u2019s taskspecifc utility. Furthermore, a performance reduction of at least $1.83\\\\%$ on the HumanEval pass $@1$ score is recorded for other methods, suggesting that unlearning GitHub codes from the LLM\\u2019s pretraining dataset while maintaining coding capabilities presents a challenging task.\\nUnlearning copyrighted books. We instruct the pre-trained Yi-6B to unlearn 500 books randomly selected from its training data. This process simulates scenarios in which authors or publishers aim to withdraw their literary works, thereby protecting the uniqueness of their content or preventing the model from generating derivative works. The unlearning results are detailed in Table 3.\\nSimilar to the GitHub code domain, the vanilla model\\u2019s perplexities of 7.62 for the forget set and 10.11 for the approximate set suggest weaker generalization compared to the arXiv domain. Moreover, when fne-tuning to reach perplexity levels similar to approximate retraining, models unlearned via fne-tuning with random labels, adversarial sample unlearning, and the combination of gradient ascent with gradient descent on in-distribution data result in lower accuracy on the forget set than other methods. This indicates that these strategies more effectively obfuscate the model to predict accurately for the forget set, thus better protecting against potential information extraction from the model.\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
