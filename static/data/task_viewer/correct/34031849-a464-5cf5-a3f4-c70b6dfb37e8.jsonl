{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The top left column of Figure 4 illustrates the overall performance on POPQA. As shown, even without using incontext examples, larger LMs exhibit reasonable performance: GPT-3 achieves $35\\\\%$ accuracy, and GPT-Neo 20B achieves $25\\\\%$ accuracy. This indicates that large LMs memorize factual knowledge in their parameters to some extent. This section examines which types of knowledge are better memorized and what factors infuence memorization.\\nSubject entity popularity predicts memorization. Figure 4 (bottom) shows that there is a positive correlation between subject entity popularity and models\\u2019 accuracy for almost all relationship types. This supports our hypothesis that subject entity popularity can be a reliable indicator of LMs\\u2019 factual knowledge memorization. In general, the correlations between subject entity popularity and accuracy are stronger for larger LMs; GPT-3 003 shows the highest positive correlation (roughly 0.4) while GPT-Neo-1.3B shows relatively weak positive correlations (approximately 0.1).\\nRelationship types affects memorization. We fnd that models have a higher average performance for some relationship types than for others. While this is evidence that factual knowledge of some relationship types are more easily memorized than others, we also observe that questions of certain relationship types can be easily guessed without memorizing the knowledge triple. Specifcally, certain relationship types (e.g., nationalities) allow models to exploit surface-level artifacts in subject entity names (Poerner et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2021). Additionally, models often output the most dominant answer entities for questions about relationship types with fewer answer entities (e.g., red for the color relationship type). In Figure 4, relationships with lower correlation (e.g., country, sport) often shows higher accuracy, indicating that on those relationship types, models may exploit surface-level clues. On the other hand, for relationship types with relatively low accuracy (e.g., occupation, author, director), larger LMs often show a high correlation. Further details are in Appendix C.1.\\n\\nScaling may not help with tail knowledge. As seen in the left column of Figure 4, there are clear overall performance improvements with scale on the POPQA dataset. However, Figure 5 shows that on both POPQA and EntityQuestions, most of scaling\\u2019s positive effect on parametric knowledge comes from questions with high popularity. Specifcally, for the questions about the entities whose $\\\\log_{10}$ (popularity) is larger than 4, there is an improvement in accuracy as model size increases (red and yellow lines), while performance on questions with lower popularity remains relatively constant (blue and green lines). For the 4,000 least popular questions, GPT-Neo 6B, 20B, and\\nGPT-3 davinci-003 have $15\\\\%$ , $16\\\\%$ , and $19\\\\%$ accuracy, respectively.\\nThis somewhat dampens prior works\\u2019 fndings that scaling up models signifcantly improves their factual knowledge memorization (Roberts et al., 2020; Kandpal et al., 2022). We hypothesize that this is because their evaluations are often conducted on QA datasets with popular entities. In sum, scaling lowers the threshold of popularity for knowledge to be reliably memorized, but is not projected to move the threshold far into the long tail for practical model scales.\\n\\nRelationship type results breakdown. Figure 6 provides a closer look at the relationship between popularity, accuracy, and relationship type; it shows model accuracy over the popularity distributions for director and country. For the frst two types, we can see a clear positive trend between popularity and accuracy across models, and as the model size gets larger, the LMs memorize more. On the other hand, in the \\u201ccountry\\u201d relationship type, no models show trends, while overall the accuracy is high, indicating the LMs often exploit artifacts to answer less popular questions. We show example models\\u2019 predictions in Appendix Section C.3.\"}\n{\"ref_paper_id\":\"08f0b49d-a02d-5eba-8fa3-51284c90822b\",\"section_content\":\"Recent work (Huang et al., 2022) shows that LMs memorize personal information available on the web, which has signifcant security issues. Our evaluation focuses on the memorization of general entity-centric knowledge, but our fndings can be applicable to those areas. Our fndings suggest that LMs are likely to have less reliable knowledge of minority groups. Parrish et al. (2022) established that models often rely on stereotypes to answer in uncertain cases, so our results indicate that LMs are likely to rely on stereotypes disproportionately for minority groups.

A key\\nchallenge for ongoing research now lies in long-\\nform question answering where the goal is to gen-\\nerate detailed explanations in response to questions\\nthat require elaborate and in-depth answers.\\nThere is much less data available for the task of\\nlong-form QA. One of the primary data sources\\nis the ELI5 dataset (Fan et al., 2019) that pairs\\nopen-ended questions with paragraph-long answers\\nwritten by users of the \\u201cExplain Like I\\u2019m Five\\u201d\\nReddit forum. However, questions in ELI5 are\\nvery general (e.g., \\u201cHow can different animals\\nperceive different colors?\\u201d) and can be an-\\nswered in myriad different ways, making it hard to\\nde\\ufb01ne objective criteria for a good answer. As a re-\\nsult, Krishna et al. (2021) identify several hurdles\\nin using this data towards meaningful modeling\\nprogress, including a lack of reliable evaluation\\nmetrics.\\nIn this work, we address the lack of data sources\\nand unreliability of evaluations by constructing a\\nlong-form QA dataset for factoid questions. Our\\npaper is motivated by the work of Min et al. (2020)\\nwho observe that more than half of the factoid ques-\\ntions that occur naturally are ambiguous. For ex-\\nample, a seemingly simple question: \\u201cWho was\\nthe ruler of France in 1830?\\\" is ambiguous\\nbecause there were two rulers of France in 1830.\\nMin et al. (2020) collected the AMBIGQA dataset\\nthat connects ambiguous factoid questions with dis-\\nambiguations: pairs of disambiguated questions\\nand unique short answers to these questions (see\\nexample on the right side of Figure 1).\\nWe note, however, that ambiguous questions of-\\nten arise when a user lacks background knowledge\\nabout why there might be multiple answers to their\\nquestion, and how those answers relate to each\\nother. Thus, the list of disambiguations may not\\nbe satisfactory for the user. For example, the fact\\nthat in 1830 the ruler of France changed due to the\\n1\\narXiv:2204.06092v2  [cs.CL]  22 Jan 2023\\nReference 2:\\nInput Question: Who was the ruler of France in 1830?\\nASQA evaluation\\nRouge\\nDisambig-Acc\\nOutput Answer:\\nThe French Revolution of 1830, also \\nknown as the July Revolution or the \\u2026\\nDR Score\\nmax(R1, R2)\\nmean(Q1, Q2)\\nDisambiguations\\n(from AmbigQA)\\nQ1: Who was the ruler of \\nFrance until 2 August 1830?\\nCharles Philippe, Charles X\\nQ2: Who was the ruler of \\nFrance after 9 August 1830?\\nLouis-Philippe\\nLong-Form QA System\\nGeometric Mean\\nKnowledge Source\\nReference 1:\\nCharles X (born Charles Philippe, Count of Artois) was King of \\nFrance from 16 September 1824 until 2 August 1830.

Input questions are sourced from AMBIGQA (Min et al., 2020). Long-form answers must be suf\\ufb01cient to\\nanswer disambiguated questions from AMBIGQA (short answers are marked in blue and green), and should intro-\\nduce additional knowledge from Wikipedia (highlighted in red) to resolve ambiguity and clarify the relationship\\nbetween different short answers. The DR score we propose combines ROUGE and Disambiguation-accuracy (that\\nis, correctness) metrics, overcoming the issues with long-form QA evaluation outlined by Krishna et al. (2021).\\nrevolution is highly salient but is not captured in\\nthe AMBIGQA disambiguations.\\nIn this paper, we argue the importance of gen-\\nerating long-form answers to ambiguous factoid\\nquestions. In that, we present ASQA (Answer\\nSummaries for Questions which are Ambiguous)\\u2014\\na novel dataset that pairs each ambiguous question\\nfrom AMBIGQA with a crowdsourced long-form\\nanswer.1 The answers we collect aim to (i) explain\\nthe source of ambiguity in the question, and (ii)\\nconnect all the valid short answers into a coherent\\npassage. An example ASQA instance is shown in\\nFigure 1.\\nThe main feature of ASQA is a combination of\\n(i) a well-de\\ufb01ned notion of correctness pertinent to\\nfactoid QA and (ii) the complexity of long-form QA.\\nFirst, observe that a good answer to an ambiguous\\nquestion should be suf\\ufb01cient for the user to answer\\ndifferent interpretations of the question. This ob-\\nservation induces a notion of correctness that is\\nconceptually similar to the conventional accuracy\\nin factoid QA. Second, to answer an ambiguous\\nquestion, a system needs to retrieve a diverse set of\\ndocuments that talk about different interpretations\\nof the question and synthesize this information into\\na coherent summary. Thus, the key challenges of\\nlong-form QA\\u2014precise retrieval and high-quality\\nsummarization\\u2014are present in ASQA.\\n1Data, evaluation scripts, and other supplementary\\nmaterials are provided on the project\\u2019s GitHub repos-\\nitory:\\nhttps:\\/\\/github.com\\/google-research\\/\\nlanguage\\/tree\\/master\\/language\\/asqa\\nContributions\\nOverall, our work makes several\\ncontributions:\\n\\u2022 First, we carefully develop a crowdsourcing\\npipeline and collect ASQA\\u2014a dataset of high-\\nquality long-form answers to 6,316 ambiguous\\nfactoid questions.\\n\\u2022 Second, we design principled evaluation proce-\\ndures for ASQA: (i) we propose a novel auto-\\nmated evaluation metric (DR) that combines the\\ncorrectness aspect of factoid QA and the \\ufb02uency\\naspect of long-form QA; (ii) we develop and re-\\nlease a convenient interface for human evalua-\\ntions; (iii) we conduct a small-scale human study\\nthat shows a high agreement between our auto-\\nmated metric DR and human judgments.\\n\\u2022 Third, we establish strong baselines for our task\\nby combining joint passage retrieval (Min et al.,\\n2021) and T5-large (Raffel et al., 2019). Our\\nextensive evaluations demonstrate that there is\\na large gap between the baselines and human\\nperformance. Additionally, we highlight areas of\\nimprovement for future research on ASQA.\\n2\"}\n{\"ref_paper_id\":\"ca66eda5-e6f7-5d97-b474-6f515c7754eb\",\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nIn this section, we describe relevant works that\\npropose new tasks, datasets, and methods for QA\\nand summarization problems.\\nExtractive QA\\nMuch of the existing work on\\nquestion answering, including reading compre-\\nhension (Rajpurkar et al., 2016, 2018; Trischler\\net al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018), open-domain\\n2\\nQA (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2017)\\nand dialog-based QA (Choi et al., 2018), assumes\\nthat questions have unique answers. Min et al.\\n(2020) relax this assumption and propose a task that\\naims at identifying all possible short answers to the\\nambiguous subset of the open-domain version of\\nthe NQ dataset, denoted NQ-OPEN (Kwiatkowski\\net al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019). The AMBIGQA\\ndataset constructed by Min et al. (2020) serves as a\\nbuilding block of the present work and we provide\\nmore details on this dataset in Section 3. Another\\nrelated effort is the CONDITIONALQA task (Sun\\net al., 2021) that requires systems to identify condi-\\ntions under which the extracted answers are valid.\\nUnlike the ASQA task, the answers in CONDI-\\nTIONALQA come from a document provided in\\nadvance and do not need to be summarized into a\\nsingle response.\\nGenerative QA\\nExtractive models achieve good\\nresults when the answer to the question is read-\\nily available on the web. However, in many set-\\ntings, including ambiguous factoid questions, a\\nsystem needs to combine information from many\\n(unknown) sources to present the answer to the user\\nin a convenient way. Hence, in this work, we focus\\non the generative QA setting where a model needs\\nto generate a textual answer rather than extract it.\\nDatasets for generative QA include NARRA-\\nTIVEQA (Ko\\u02c7\\ncisk\\u00fd et al., 2018) and COQA (Reddy\\net al., 2019), but the average answer length in\\nthese datasets is small: 4.7 and 2.7 tokens, re-\\nspectively. The MS MARCO Natural Language\\nGeneration (MS-NLG) dataset by Nguyen et al.\\n(2016) combines both extractive and generative\\ntasks and contains slightly longer human-generated\\nanswers (usually, a sentence-long) that can be read\\nby a smart assistant. Fan et al. (2019) proposed\\na more challenging task of answering open-ended\\n(e.g., \\u201cwhy?\\u201d) questions. They scraped the \\u201cEx-\\nplain Like I\\u2019m Five\\u201d Reddit forum and released a\\ndataset of \\u223c272K questions, where each question\\nis supplied with several paragraph-long answers\\ngenerated by the Reddit users. We overview the\\ndifferences between ASQA, ELI5 and MS-NLG\\nin Section 3.3.\\nRecently, large language models such as GPT-3\\n(Brown et al., 2020) have been successfully ap-\\nplied to the task of long-form QA using the ELI5\\ndataset (Nakano et al., 2021). For this, a two-step\\nhuman-in-the-loop approach was involved: \\ufb01rst,\\ndemonstrations of annotators navigating the web\\nto write answers were collected; second, a reward\\nmodel (Stiennon et al., 2020) was trained by man-\\nual pairwise comparisons of answers. In ASQA,\\nrelevant passages for the answer are already pro-\\nvided by the annotators and we show that the pro-\\nposed DR score correlates well with the human\\njudgment of answer quality. Using this automated\\nmetric in place of the reward model in the approach\\nof Nakano et al. (2021) is a potential direction for\\nfuture work.\\nSummarization\\nGiven a set of documents rel-\\nevant to the question (either ground truth or ob-\\ntained using retrieval) the problem of generat-\\ning a long-form answer reduces to query-based\\nmulti-document summarization.\\nA small-scale\\ndataset for this task was introduced as part of\\nthe DUC tasks (Dang, 2005). Recent work on\\nbuilding large-scale datasets has instead focused\\neither on query-based summarization from a sin-\\ngle document (Nema et al., 2017; Zhong et al.,\\n2021) or on multi-document summarization with-\\nout queries (Liu et al., 2018; Fabbri et al., 2019).\\nIn addition to the QA task, the ASQA dataset is\\nsuitable for the evaluation of systems\\u2019 accuracy in\\nthe summarization setting, where the ground-truth\\npassages containing the relevant information are\\nassumed to be given.\\nQA-Based Evaluation\\nPrior work has looked at\\nusing question answering techniques to evaluate\\nfactual consistency in summarization (Wang et al.,\\n2020; Durmus et al., 2020) and dialogue (Honovich\\net al., 2021). These works automatically gener-\\nate questions from the system-produced text and\\nsearch for answers in some reference text (e.g., the\\ninput being summarized) to evaluate the quality\\nof the output.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"ref_paper_id\":\"08f0b49d-a02d-5eba-8fa3-51284c90822b\",\"section_content\":\"Overall model performance. The top left column of Figure 4 illustrates the overall performance on POPQA. As shown, even without using incontext examples, larger LMs exhibit reasonable performance: GPT-3 achieves $35\\\\%$ accuracy, and GPT-Neo 20B achieves $25\\\\%$ accuracy. This indicates that large LMs memorize factual knowledge in their parameters to some extent. This section examines which types of knowledge are better memorized and what factors infuence memorization.\\nSubject entity popularity predicts memorization. Figure 4 (bottom) shows that there is a positive correlation between subject entity popularity and models\\u2019 accuracy for almost all relationship types. This supports our hypothesis that subject entity popularity can be a reliable indicator of LMs\\u2019 factual knowledge memorization. In general, the correlations between subject entity popularity and accuracy are stronger for larger LMs; GPT-3 003 shows the highest positive correlation (roughly 0.4) while GPT-Neo-1.3B shows relatively weak positive correlations (approximately 0.1).\\nRelationship types affects memorization. We fnd that models have a higher average performance for some relationship types than for others. While this is evidence that factual knowledge of some relationship types are more easily memorized than others, we also observe that questions of certain relationship types can be easily guessed without memorizing the knowledge triple. Specifcally, certain relationship types (e.g., nationalities) allow models to exploit surface-level artifacts in subject entity names (Poerner et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2021). Additionally, models often output the most dominant answer entities for questions about relationship types with fewer answer entities (e.g., red for the color relationship type). In Figure 4, relationships with lower correlation (e.g., country, sport) often shows higher accuracy, indicating that on those relationship types, models may exploit surface-level clues. On the other hand, for relationship types with relatively low accuracy (e.g., occupation, author, director), larger LMs often show a high correlation. Further details are in Appendix C.1.\\n\\nScaling may not help with tail knowledge. As seen in the left column of Figure 4, there are clear overall performance improvements with scale on the POPQA dataset. However, Figure 5 shows that on both POPQA and EntityQuestions, most of scaling\\u2019s positive effect on parametric knowledge comes from questions with high popularity. Specifcally, for the questions about the entities whose $\\\\log_{10}$ (popularity) is larger than 4, there is an improvement in accuracy as model size increases (red and yellow lines), while performance on questions with lower popularity remains relatively constant (blue and green lines). For the 4,000 least popular questions, GPT-Neo 6B, 20B, and\\nGPT-3 davinci-003 have $15\\\\%$ , $16\\\\%$ , and $19\\\\%$ accuracy, respectively.\\nThis somewhat dampens prior works\\u2019 fndings that scaling up models signifcantly improves their factual knowledge memorization (Roberts et al., 2020; Kandpal et al., 2022). We hypothesize that this is because their evaluations are often conducted on QA datasets with popular entities. In sum, scaling lowers the threshold of popularity for knowledge to be reliably memorized, but is not projected to move the threshold far into the long tail for practical model scales.\\n\\nRelationship type results breakdown. Figure 6 provides a closer look at the relationship between popularity, accuracy, and relationship type; it shows model accuracy over the popularity distributions for director and country. For the frst two types, we can see a clear positive trend between popularity and accuracy across models, and as the model size gets larger, the LMs memorize more. On the other hand, in the \\u201ccountry\\u201d relationship type, no models show trends, while overall the accuracy is high, indicating the LMs often exploit artifacts to answer less popular questions. We show example models\\u2019 predictions in Appendix Section C.3.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
