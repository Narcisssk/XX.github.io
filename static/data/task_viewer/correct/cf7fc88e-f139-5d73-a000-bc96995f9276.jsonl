{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. IN THE RESPONSE, YOU SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN ONE TURN, THAT IS TO SAY, YOU SHOULD OUTPUT EXACTLY ONE THOUGHT AND ONTE ACTION. Now, let's start!\n"}

The Criteo\\nAd Kaggle dataset is a common benchmark dataset for CTR predictions. It consists of a week\\u2019s\\nworth of data, approximately 45 million samples in total. Each data point contains a binary label,\\nwhich indicates whether the user clicks or not, along with 13 continuous, 26 categorical features.\\nThe positive label accounts for 25.3% of all data. The categorical features consist of 1.3 million\\ncategories on average, with 1 feature having more than 10 million categories, 5 features having more\\nthan 1 million categories. Due to computational constraints in our experiments, we use the first 15\\nmillion samples, shuffle the dataset randomly, and split the whole dataset into 85% train Dtrain, 1.5%\\nvalidation-train Dval\\u2212train, 1.5% validation-test Dval\\u2212test, and 12% test Dtest datasets.\\nBase Model We use the state-of-the-art deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) (Naumov\\net al., 2019) open-sourced by Meta as our baseline model. DLRM employs a standard architecture\\nfor ranking tasks, with embeddings to handle categorical features, Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)\\nto handle continuous features and the interactions of categorical features and continuous features.\\nThroughout our experiments, we use the default parameters and a SGD optimizer. Note that our\\nmethod is model-agnostic, so it can be directly applied to other models (e.g. support vector machines,\\nboosted trees, nearest neighbors, etc Friedman et al. (2001)).\\nBaseline Calibration Methods We compare our method with various classic calibration methods.\\nFor parametric methods, we compare against Platt scaling (Platt et al., 1999). For non-parametric\\nmethods, we compare against histogram binning (Zadrozny & Elkan, 2002; 2001), isotonic regression\\n(Menon et al., 2012), and scaling-binning calibrator (Kumar et al., 2019). We use the labeled training\\nvalidation dataset to do calibration for above methods.\\nNote that none of the existing work explicitly considers maximization bias and thus fails to perform\\nwell in our setting. VAD can be combined with all existing calibration methods to achieve better per-\\nformance by making a small change to the original VAD algorithm. VAD takes predictions calibrated\\nby other calibration methods as inputs. Additionally, instead of directly using \\u03bb calculated from\\nDval\\u2212test,X, we first calculate \\u03bbval\\u2212test from Dval\\u2212test,X using original predictions and \\u03bbval\\u2212train\\nfrom Dval\\u2212train,X (the unlabeled validation set which has the same distribution as the X margin of the\\ntraining set) using original predictions, and then use \\u03bb = \\u03bbval\\u2212test\\/\\u03bbval\\u2212train to adjust predictions\\ncalibrated by other methods. This change is due to the fact that other calibration methods already\\ncompensate for maximization bias in training distribution to some extent.\\nVAD Parameters The last layer of the DLRM network uses the sigmoid activation function. In our\\nmethod, by using the link function \\u03d5(x) = (1 + exp(\\u2212x))\\u22121, we compute the means \\u00af\\nY l\\ni , variance\\n(\\u02c6\\n\\u03c3l\\n\\u02c6\\nY )2, and expected conditional variance (\\u02c6\\n\\u03c3l\\nf)2 of the last layer\\u2019s neuron. To compute the expected\\nprediction variance (\\u02c6\\n\\u03c3l\\nf)2, we keep the training data unchanged and modify the random initialization\\nand data orders since the optimizer itself incurs sufficient randomness. In the experiment, we train\\nS = 2 times for our method.\\nCovariate Shift Since the underlying true data-generating process is unknown, we employ a different\\nstrategy to construct out-of-distribution test data than how we generate synthetic data: we train another\\nDLRM model using 85% \\u00d7 15 million samples different from the original dataset; we randomly keep\\neach data point in the original test set with probability 1 \\u2212p, where p is the newly-trained DLRM\\nmodel prediction for the data point. The training set remains the same. After this shift, the positive\\nsamples account for 20.1% of all test data. By doing this, we ensure that the distributional change is\\nonly a covariate shift, and the positive sample ratio in the test data is lower than the positive sample\\nratio in the training data, which is consistent with the real-world recommendation systems.\\nPerformance We replicate the experiments 40 times and report averages and standard errors of\\ncalibration errors and ECE (with number of bins M = 50) for \\u03b1 \\u2208{2%, 10%} in Tables 2 and 3.\\n(MCE is in Appendix B.2), where Original stands for using calibration methods solely and VAD+\\nrepresents the tandem combination of the calibration methods and VAD. We plot average calibration\\nerrors and average ECE for \\u03b1 \\u2208[2%, 10%] in Figure 2.
