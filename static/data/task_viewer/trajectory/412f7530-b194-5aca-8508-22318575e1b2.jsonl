{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The objective of RAISE is to maximize the log-likelihood log p(xT |xS) while learning\\natomic rules shared among RPMs. In the following sections, we will introduce the generative and\\ninference processes of RAISE that can abstract and select atomic rules in the latent space.\\n3.1\\nCONDITIONAL GENERATION\\nThe generative process is the foundation of answer generation, including the stages of concept learn-\\ning, abstract reasoning, and image generation.\\nConcept Learning. RAISE extracts interpretable image representations for abstract reasoning and\\nimage generation in the concept learning stage. Previous studies have emphasized the role of ab-\\nstract object representations in the abstract reasoning of infants (Kahneman et al., 1992; Gordon &\\nIrwin, 1996) and the bene\\ufb01t of disentangled representations for RPM solvers (Van Steenkiste et al.,\\n2019), which re\\ufb02ect the compositionality of human cognition (Lake et al., 2011). RAISE realizes\\ncompositionality by learning latent representations of attributes (Shi et al., 2021; 2023). RAISE\\nregards image attributes as latent concepts and decomposes the rules of RPMs into atomic rules\\nbased on the latent concepts. Since the description of attributes is not provided in training, the latent\\nconcepts learned by RAISE are not exactly the same as the realistic attributes de\\ufb01ned in the dataset.\\nRAISE extracts C context latent concepts zs = {zc\\ns}C\\nc=1 for each context image xs (s \\u2208S):\\n\\u00b51:C\\ns\\n= genc\\n\\u03b8\\n(xs) ,\\ns \\u2208S,\\nzc\\ns \\u223cN\\n\\u0000\\u00b5c\\ns, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nc = 1, .., C,\\ns \\u2208S.\\n(1)\\nThe encoder genc\\n\\u03b8\\noutputs the mean of context latent concepts. The standard deviation is controlled\\nby a hyperparameter \\u03c3z to keep training stability. Each context image is processed through genc\\n\\u03b8\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nindependently, making it possible to extract latent concepts for any set of input images. In this stage,\\nthe encoder does not consider any relationships between images and focuses on concept learning.\\nAbstract Reasoning. As illustrated in Figure 1b, RAISE predicts target latent concepts zT from\\ncontext latent concepts zS in the abstract reasoning stage, involving rule abstraction, rule selection,\\nand rule execution processes. To abstract atomic rules and build the global knowledge set, RAISE\\nadopts K global learnable parameters \\u03c8 = {\\u03c8k}K\\nk=1, each indicating an atomic rule shared among\\nRPMs. In rule selection, we use categorical indicators {rc}C\\nc=1 (rc = 1, ..., K) to select a proper\\nrule out of \\u03c8 for each concept. Inferring the indicators from zS correctly is critical to rule selection.\\nRAISE creates a 3\\u00d73 representation matrix Zc for each concept, initializing the representations of\\ncontext images with the corresponding context latent concepts and those of target images with zero\\nvectors. Then RAISE extracts the row-wise and column-wise representations:\\npc\\ni = f row\\n\\u03c61\\n\\u0000Zc\\ni,1:3\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nqc\\ni = f col\\n\\u03c62\\n\\u0000Zc\\n1:3,i\\n\\u0001\\n,\\ni = 1, 2, 3,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(2)\\nRAISE averages the representations via \\u00af\\npc = (pc\\n1 + pc\\n2 + pc\\n3)\\/3 and \\u00af\\nqc = (qc\\n1 + qc\\n2 + qc\\n3)\\/3 to\\nobtain integrated representations of row and column rules. We concatenate \\u00af\\npc and \\u00af\\nqc to acquire the\\nprobability of selecting atomic rules out of the global knowledge set:\\nrc \\u223cCategorical (\\u03c0c\\n1:K) ,\\n\\u03c0c\\n1, ..., \\u03c0c\\nK = f ind\\n\\u03c63\\n\\u0000\\u00af\\npc, \\u00af\\nqc\\u0001\\n,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(3)\\nWe denote the learnable parameters as \\u03c6 = {\\u03c61, \\u03c62, \\u03c63} for convenience. In rule execution, RAISE\\nselects and executes an atomic rule on each concept to predict the target latent concepts:\\n\\u00b5c\\nT = h (Zc; \\u03c8rc) ,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nzc\\nt \\u223cN\\n\\u0000\\u00b5c\\nt, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nt \\u2208T,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(4)\\nRAISE instantiates h by selecting the rc-th learnable parameters from the global knowledge set \\u03c8 to\\nconvert the zero-initialized target representations in Zc into the mean of target latent concepts. As\\nin the concept learning stage, the standard deviation of target latent concepts is controlled by \\u03c3z. h\\nconsists of convolution layers to aggregate information from neighbor context latent concepts on the\\nmatrix and update target latent concepts. Each learnable parameters in \\u03c8 indicates a type of atomic\\nrule. See Appendix C.1 for the detailed description of h.\\nImage Generation. Finally, RAISE decodes the target latent concepts predicted in the abstract\\nreasoning stage into the mean of target images:\\nxt \\u223cN\\n\\u0000\\u039bt, \\u03c32\\nxI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\n\\u039bt = gdec\\n\\u03d5\\n\\u0000z1:C\\nt\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nt \\u2208T.\\n(5)\\nRAISE generates each target image independently to make the decoder focus on image reconstruc-\\ntion. We control the noise of target images by setting the standard deviation \\u03c3x as a hyperparameter.\\nAccording to Figure 1a, we decompose the conditional generative process as\\np\\u0398(h, xT |xS) =\\nY\\nt\\u2208T\\np\\u03d5(xt|zt)\\nC\\nY\\nc=1\\n \\np\\u03c8(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS)p\\u03c6(rc|zc\\nS)\\nY\\ns\\u2208S\\np\\u03b8(zc\\ns|xs)\\n!\\n(6)\\nwhere h is the set of all latent variables and \\u0398 = {\\u03b8, \\u03c6, \\u03c8, \\u03d5} are learnable parameters of RAISE.\\n3.2\\nVARIATIONAL INFERENCE\\nRAISE approximates the untractable posterior with a variational distribution q(h|xT , xS) (Kingma\\n& Welling, 2013), which consists of the following distributions.\\nq(zc\\ns|xs) = N\\n\\u0000\\u02dc\\n\\u00b5c\\ns, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\ns \\u2208S,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nq(zc\\nt|xt) = N\\n\\u0000\\u02dc\\n\\u00b5c\\nt, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nt \\u2208T,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nq(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) = Categorical (\\u02dc\\n\\u03c0c\\n1:K) ,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(7)\\nSince RAISE shares the encoder between the generative and inference processes to reduce the model\\nparameters, we compute context latent concepts \\u02dc\\n\\u00b51:C\\ns\\nand target latent concepts \\u02dc\\n\\u00b51:C\\nt\\nvia the same\\nprocess described in Equation 1. In the inference process, RAISE reformulates the variational dis-\\ntribution of the categorical indicator rc as q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) \\u221dp(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS)p(rc|zc\\nS). That is, RAISE\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\npredicts the prior probabilities \\u03c0c\\n1:K of p(rc|zc\\nS) from the context latent concepts zc\\nS and compute\\nthe likelihood p(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS) by executing the atomic rule rc (rc = 1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , K) on zc\\nS. In this way,\\nwe can estimate the variational distribution q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) by considering both the prior probabilities\\nand the likelihoods of K atomic rules, which reduces the risk of model collapse (e.g., always select-\\ning one atomic rule from \\u03c8). We provide more details of q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) in Appendix A.1. Letting\\n\\u03a8 = {\\u03b8, \\u03c6, \\u03c8}, we factorize the variational distribution as\\nq\\u03a8(h|xT , xS) =\\nC\\nY\\nc=1\\n \\nq\\u03c6,\\u03c8(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT )\\nY\\ns\\u2208S\\nq\\u03b8(zc\\ns|xs)\\nY\\nt\\u2208T\\nq\\u03b8(zc\\nt|xt)\\n!\\n.\\n(8)\\n3.3\\nPARAMETER LEARNING\\nWe update the parameters of RAISE by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-\\nlikelihood log p(xT |xS) (Kingma & Welling, 2013). With the generative process p\\u0398 and the varia-\\ntional distribution q\\u03a8 de\\ufb01ned in Equations 6 and 8, the ELBO is (q denotes the variational distribu-\\ntion, and we omit the parameter symbols \\u0398 and \\u03a8 for convenience)\\nL = Eq\\u03a8(h|xT ,xS)\\n\\u0014\\nlog p\\u0398 (h, xT |xS)\\nq\\u03a8(h|xT , xS)\\n\\u0015\\n=\\nX\\nt\\u2208T\\nEq\\n\\u0002\\nlog p(xt|zt)\\n\\u0003\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nLrec\\n\\u2212\\nC\\nX\\nc=1\\nEq\\n\\u0014\\nlog\\nq(zc\\nT |xT )\\np(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS)\\n\\u0015\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRpred\\n\\u2212\\nC\\nX\\nc=1\\nEq\\n\\u0014\\nlog q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT )\\np(rc|zc\\nS)\\n\\u0015\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRrule\\n(9)\\nThe reconstruction loss Lrec measures the quality of the reconstruction images. The concept regu-\\nlarizer Rpred estimates the distance between the predicted target concepts and the concepts directly\\nencoded from target images. Minimizing Rpred will promote RAISE to generate correct predictions\\nin the space of latent concepts. The rule regularizer Rrule expects RAISE to select the same rules\\nwhen given different sets of images in an RPM. The variational posterior q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) conditioned\\non the entire matrix and the prior p(rc|zc\\nS) conditioned on the context images are expected to have\\nsimilar probabilities. The detailed derivation of the ELBO is provided in Appendix A.2.\\nThe abstraction and selection of atomic rules rely on the acquired latent concepts. Therefore, RAISE\\nintroduces auxiliary rule annotations to improve the quality of latent concepts and stabilize the learn-\\ning process. We denote rule annotations as v = {va}A\\na=1 where A is the number of ground truth\\nattributes and va indicates the type of rules on the a-th attribute. For example, v = [2, 1, 3] means\\nthat the attributes follow the second, \\ufb01rst, and third rules respectively. RAISE does not leverage\\nthe meta-information of attributes in training since the rule annotations only inform the type of rule\\non each attribute. The meaning of attributes is automatically learned by RAISE for accurate rule\\nabstraction and selection. One key to guiding concept learning with rule annotations is determining\\nthe correspondence between latent concepts and attributes. RAISE introduces a A\\u00d7C binary matrix\\nM where Ma,c = 1 indicates that the a-th attribute is encoded in the c-th latent concept. Therefore,\\nthe rule predicted on the c-th latent concept is supervised by the rule annotation va, and the auxiliary\\nloss measures distances between the predicted and ground truth types of rules:\\nLsup = 1\\n2\\nA\\nX\\na=1\\nC\\nX\\nc=1\\nMa,c log\\n\\u0000\\u03c0c\\nva + \\u02dc\\n\\u03c0c\\nva\\n\\u0001\\n.\\n(10)\\nThe auxiliary loss Lsup is the log-likelihood of the categorical distributions considering the attribute-\\nconcept correspondence M. The binary matrix M is derived by solving the following assignment\\nproblem on a batch of RPM samples:\\narg max\\nM\\nLsup\\ns.t.\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f3\\nPC\\nc=1 Ma,c = 1,\\na = 1, ..., A,\\nPA\\na=1 Ma,c = 0 or 1,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nMa,c = 0 or 1,\\na = 1, ..., A,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(11)\\nEquation 11 allows the existence of redundant latent concepts, which can be solved using the modi-\\n\\ufb01ed Jonker-Volgenant algorithm (Crouse, 2016).

The objective of RAISE is to maximize the log-likelihood log p(xT |xS) while learning\\natomic rules shared among RPMs. In the following sections, we will introduce the generative and\\ninference processes of RAISE that can abstract and select atomic rules in the latent space.\\n3.1\\nCONDITIONAL GENERATION\\nThe generative process is the foundation of answer generation, including the stages of concept learn-\\ning, abstract reasoning, and image generation.\\nConcept Learning. RAISE extracts interpretable image representations for abstract reasoning and\\nimage generation in the concept learning stage. Previous studies have emphasized the role of ab-\\nstract object representations in the abstract reasoning of infants (Kahneman et al., 1992; Gordon &\\nIrwin, 1996) and the bene\\ufb01t of disentangled representations for RPM solvers (Van Steenkiste et al.,\\n2019), which re\\ufb02ect the compositionality of human cognition (Lake et al., 2011). RAISE realizes\\ncompositionality by learning latent representations of attributes (Shi et al., 2021; 2023). RAISE\\nregards image attributes as latent concepts and decomposes the rules of RPMs into atomic rules\\nbased on the latent concepts. Since the description of attributes is not provided in training, the latent\\nconcepts learned by RAISE are not exactly the same as the realistic attributes de\\ufb01ned in the dataset.\\nRAISE extracts C context latent concepts zs = {zc\\ns}C\\nc=1 for each context image xs (s \\u2208S):\\n\\u00b51:C\\ns\\n= genc\\n\\u03b8\\n(xs) ,\\ns \\u2208S,\\nzc\\ns \\u223cN\\n\\u0000\\u00b5c\\ns, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nc = 1, .., C,\\ns \\u2208S.\\n(1)\\nThe encoder genc\\n\\u03b8\\noutputs the mean of context latent concepts. The standard deviation is controlled\\nby a hyperparameter \\u03c3z to keep training stability. Each context image is processed through genc\\n\\u03b8\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nindependently, making it possible to extract latent concepts for any set of input images. In this stage,\\nthe encoder does not consider any relationships between images and focuses on concept learning.\\nAbstract Reasoning. As illustrated in Figure 1b, RAISE predicts target latent concepts zT from\\ncontext latent concepts zS in the abstract reasoning stage, involving rule abstraction, rule selection,\\nand rule execution processes. To abstract atomic rules and build the global knowledge set, RAISE\\nadopts K global learnable parameters \\u03c8 = {\\u03c8k}K\\nk=1, each indicating an atomic rule shared among\\nRPMs. In rule selection, we use categorical indicators {rc}C\\nc=1 (rc = 1, ..., K) to select a proper\\nrule out of \\u03c8 for each concept. Inferring the indicators from zS correctly is critical to rule selection.\\nRAISE creates a 3\\u00d73 representation matrix Zc for each concept, initializing the representations of\\ncontext images with the corresponding context latent concepts and those of target images with zero\\nvectors. Then RAISE extracts the row-wise and column-wise representations:\\npc\\ni = f row\\n\\u03c61\\n\\u0000Zc\\ni,1:3\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nqc\\ni = f col\\n\\u03c62\\n\\u0000Zc\\n1:3,i\\n\\u0001\\n,\\ni = 1, 2, 3,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(2)\\nRAISE averages the representations via \\u00af\\npc = (pc\\n1 + pc\\n2 + pc\\n3)\\/3 and \\u00af\\nqc = (qc\\n1 + qc\\n2 + qc\\n3)\\/3 to\\nobtain integrated representations of row and column rules. We concatenate \\u00af\\npc and \\u00af\\nqc to acquire the\\nprobability of selecting atomic rules out of the global knowledge set:\\nrc \\u223cCategorical (\\u03c0c\\n1:K) ,\\n\\u03c0c\\n1, ..., \\u03c0c\\nK = f ind\\n\\u03c63\\n\\u0000\\u00af\\npc, \\u00af\\nqc\\u0001\\n,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(3)\\nWe denote the learnable parameters as \\u03c6 = {\\u03c61, \\u03c62, \\u03c63} for convenience. In rule execution, RAISE\\nselects and executes an atomic rule on each concept to predict the target latent concepts:\\n\\u00b5c\\nT = h (Zc; \\u03c8rc) ,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nzc\\nt \\u223cN\\n\\u0000\\u00b5c\\nt, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nt \\u2208T,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(4)\\nRAISE instantiates h by selecting the rc-th learnable parameters from the global knowledge set \\u03c8 to\\nconvert the zero-initialized target representations in Zc into the mean of target latent concepts. As\\nin the concept learning stage, the standard deviation of target latent concepts is controlled by \\u03c3z. h\\nconsists of convolution layers to aggregate information from neighbor context latent concepts on the\\nmatrix and update target latent concepts. Each learnable parameters in \\u03c8 indicates a type of atomic\\nrule. See Appendix C.1 for the detailed description of h.\\nImage Generation. Finally, RAISE decodes the target latent concepts predicted in the abstract\\nreasoning stage into the mean of target images:\\nxt \\u223cN\\n\\u0000\\u039bt, \\u03c32\\nxI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\n\\u039bt = gdec\\n\\u03d5\\n\\u0000z1:C\\nt\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nt \\u2208T.\\n(5)\\nRAISE generates each target image independently to make the decoder focus on image reconstruc-\\ntion. We control the noise of target images by setting the standard deviation \\u03c3x as a hyperparameter.\\nAccording to Figure 1a, we decompose the conditional generative process as\\np\\u0398(h, xT |xS) =\\nY\\nt\\u2208T\\np\\u03d5(xt|zt)\\nC\\nY\\nc=1\\n \\np\\u03c8(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS)p\\u03c6(rc|zc\\nS)\\nY\\ns\\u2208S\\np\\u03b8(zc\\ns|xs)\\n!\\n(6)\\nwhere h is the set of all latent variables and \\u0398 = {\\u03b8, \\u03c6, \\u03c8, \\u03d5} are learnable parameters of RAISE.\\n3.2\\nVARIATIONAL INFERENCE\\nRAISE approximates the untractable posterior with a variational distribution q(h|xT , xS) (Kingma\\n& Welling, 2013), which consists of the following distributions.\\nq(zc\\ns|xs) = N\\n\\u0000\\u02dc\\n\\u00b5c\\ns, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\ns \\u2208S,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nq(zc\\nt|xt) = N\\n\\u0000\\u02dc\\n\\u00b5c\\nt, \\u03c32\\nzI\\n\\u0001\\n,\\nt \\u2208T,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nq(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) = Categorical (\\u02dc\\n\\u03c0c\\n1:K) ,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(7)\\nSince RAISE shares the encoder between the generative and inference processes to reduce the model\\nparameters, we compute context latent concepts \\u02dc\\n\\u00b51:C\\ns\\nand target latent concepts \\u02dc\\n\\u00b51:C\\nt\\nvia the same\\nprocess described in Equation 1. In the inference process, RAISE reformulates the variational dis-\\ntribution of the categorical indicator rc as q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) \\u221dp(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS)p(rc|zc\\nS). That is, RAISE\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\npredicts the prior probabilities \\u03c0c\\n1:K of p(rc|zc\\nS) from the context latent concepts zc\\nS and compute\\nthe likelihood p(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS) by executing the atomic rule rc (rc = 1, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , K) on zc\\nS. In this way,\\nwe can estimate the variational distribution q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) by considering both the prior probabilities\\nand the likelihoods of K atomic rules, which reduces the risk of model collapse (e.g., always select-\\ning one atomic rule from \\u03c8). We provide more details of q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) in Appendix A.1. Letting\\n\\u03a8 = {\\u03b8, \\u03c6, \\u03c8}, we factorize the variational distribution as\\nq\\u03a8(h|xT , xS) =\\nC\\nY\\nc=1\\n \\nq\\u03c6,\\u03c8(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT )\\nY\\ns\\u2208S\\nq\\u03b8(zc\\ns|xs)\\nY\\nt\\u2208T\\nq\\u03b8(zc\\nt|xt)\\n!\\n.\\n(8)\\n3.3\\nPARAMETER LEARNING\\nWe update the parameters of RAISE by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-\\nlikelihood log p(xT |xS) (Kingma & Welling, 2013). With the generative process p\\u0398 and the varia-\\ntional distribution q\\u03a8 de\\ufb01ned in Equations 6 and 8, the ELBO is (q denotes the variational distribu-\\ntion, and we omit the parameter symbols \\u0398 and \\u03a8 for convenience)\\nL = Eq\\u03a8(h|xT ,xS)\\n\\u0014\\nlog p\\u0398 (h, xT |xS)\\nq\\u03a8(h|xT , xS)\\n\\u0015\\n=\\nX\\nt\\u2208T\\nEq\\n\\u0002\\nlog p(xt|zt)\\n\\u0003\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nLrec\\n\\u2212\\nC\\nX\\nc=1\\nEq\\n\\u0014\\nlog\\nq(zc\\nT |xT )\\np(zc\\nT |rc, zc\\nS)\\n\\u0015\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRpred\\n\\u2212\\nC\\nX\\nc=1\\nEq\\n\\u0014\\nlog q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT )\\np(rc|zc\\nS)\\n\\u0015\\n|\\n{z\\n}\\nRrule\\n(9)\\nThe reconstruction loss Lrec measures the quality of the reconstruction images. The concept regu-\\nlarizer Rpred estimates the distance between the predicted target concepts and the concepts directly\\nencoded from target images. Minimizing Rpred will promote RAISE to generate correct predictions\\nin the space of latent concepts. The rule regularizer Rrule expects RAISE to select the same rules\\nwhen given different sets of images in an RPM. The variational posterior q(rc|zc\\nS, zc\\nT ) conditioned\\non the entire matrix and the prior p(rc|zc\\nS) conditioned on the context images are expected to have\\nsimilar probabilities. The detailed derivation of the ELBO is provided in Appendix A.2.\\nThe abstraction and selection of atomic rules rely on the acquired latent concepts. Therefore, RAISE\\nintroduces auxiliary rule annotations to improve the quality of latent concepts and stabilize the learn-\\ning process. We denote rule annotations as v = {va}A\\na=1 where A is the number of ground truth\\nattributes and va indicates the type of rules on the a-th attribute. For example, v = [2, 1, 3] means\\nthat the attributes follow the second, \\ufb01rst, and third rules respectively. RAISE does not leverage\\nthe meta-information of attributes in training since the rule annotations only inform the type of rule\\non each attribute. The meaning of attributes is automatically learned by RAISE for accurate rule\\nabstraction and selection. One key to guiding concept learning with rule annotations is determining\\nthe correspondence between latent concepts and attributes. RAISE introduces a A\\u00d7C binary matrix\\nM where Ma,c = 1 indicates that the a-th attribute is encoded in the c-th latent concept. Therefore,\\nthe rule predicted on the c-th latent concept is supervised by the rule annotation va, and the auxiliary\\nloss measures distances between the predicted and ground truth types of rules:\\nLsup = 1\\n2\\nA\\nX\\na=1\\nC\\nX\\nc=1\\nMa,c log\\n\\u0000\\u03c0c\\nva + \\u02dc\\n\\u03c0c\\nva\\n\\u0001\\n.\\n(10)\\nThe auxiliary loss Lsup is the log-likelihood of the categorical distributions considering the attribute-\\nconcept correspondence M. The binary matrix M is derived by solving the following assignment\\nproblem on a batch of RPM samples:\\narg max\\nM\\nLsup\\ns.t.\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f3\\nPC\\nc=1 Ma,c = 1,\\na = 1, ..., A,\\nPA\\na=1 Ma,c = 0 or 1,\\nc = 1, ..., C,\\nMa,c = 0 or 1,\\na = 1, ..., A,\\nc = 1, ..., C.\\n(11)\\nEquation 11 allows the existence of redundant latent concepts, which can be solved using the modi-\\n\\ufb01ed Jonker-Volgenant algorithm (Crouse, 2016).

The algo-\\nrithms differ in whether they use history information (MLP back-\\nbones for no history, Transformer\\/GPT backbones for history-\\nbased models), whether they predict future action sequences (sin-\\ngle actions\\/SA or action chunking\\/AC, Transformer-Encoder-\\nDecoder\\/T-EncDec backbones for AC) and how they model di-\\nverse behavior (last column).\\nWe benchmark a large set of\\nrecent imitation learning algo-\\nrithms.\\nThese algorithms can\\nbe categorized along three axes.\\nThe first axis specifies whether\\nthe algorithms are using a his-\\ntory of state observations. For\\nalgorithms that do not use his-\\ntory (Sohn et al., 2015; Flo-\\nrence et al., 2022), a standard\\nMLP is used as backbone ar-\\nchitecture,\\nwhile for history-\\ndependent policies (Shafiullah\\net\\nal.,\\n2022;\\nPearce\\net\\nal.,\\n2023; Reuss et al., 2023; Chi\\net al., 2023) we use a causal\\nmasked Transformer Decoder\\n(GPT) based on the implemen-\\ntation of BeT (Shafiullah et al.,\\n2022) as backbone as this archi-\\ntecture has been also adopted by other recent approaches. In our experiments, we use a history of\\nk = 5. The second axis categorizes whether the algorithms are predicting only a single action or the\\nfuture action sequence (Zhao et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023), which has been recently introduced as\\n5\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\naction chunking which has been shown to improve performance in some tasks. For action chunking\\nmodels, we use a Transformer Encoder Decoder structure (T-EncDec) (Vaswani et al., 2017) based\\non the implementation of VAE-ACT (Zhao et al., 2023). The third axis categorizes how the algo-\\nrithms capture behavior diversity. Standard deterministic models are not able to do so, while more\\nrecent models use clustering (Shafiullah et al., 2022), VAEs (Zhao et al., 2023; Sohn et al., 2015),\\nimplicit models (Florence et al., 2022) as well as discrete-time (Pearce et al., 2023; Chi et al., 2023),\\nor continuous time diffusion models (Reuss et al., 2023). To improve our understanding of the in-\\nfluence of the specific design choices, we also evaluate new variants of these combinations such as\\nhistory-free (MLP-based) action clustering (BeT-MLP). The full table of used algorithmic setups is\\ndepicted in Table 2. A more detailed description of all model architectures is given in Appendix C.\\n4.2\\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\\nWe briefly outline the most important aspects of our experimental setup.\\nEvaluation Protocol. To assess a model\\u2019s ability to capture diverse behavior, we propose the behav-\\nior entropy and the conditional behavior entropy (Section 3.1). For the former, we perform multiple\\nsimulations, from which we compute the model\\u2019s behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2). For the latter, we use\\na randomly sampled but fixed set of initial states s0 and perform multiple simulations for each s0\\nin order to compute the conditional behavior distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0). Alongside the entropy, we also\\nreport the success rate which is the fraction of simulations that led to successful task completion.\\nState \\/ Observation Representation. For most experiments, we provide state representation and\\nimage observations. For the former, we use handcrafted features that work well empirically. For the\\nlatter, we used two different camera views, in-hand and front view with a 96 \\u00d7 96 image resolution.\\nWe follow Chi et al. (2023) and use a ResNet-18 architecture as an image encoder for all methods.\\nModel Selection. Model selection is challenging as the training objective does not coincide with\\ntask performance (Gulcehre et al., 2020; Paine et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021; Mandlekar et al., 2021).\\nMoreover, policy performance can exhibit substantial variations from one training epoch to another\\n(Mandlekar et al., 2021). For image-based experiments we evaluate the task performance frequently\\n(after every 1\\/10th of total training) and chose the model with the best task-performance. Due to\\nhigh-computational demand for simulation, we split the dataset into training (90%) and validation\\n(10%) and chose the model with the lowest validation loss for state-based experiments. We ensure\\nthat the training converges by using 500 epochs for state representation and 200 for image obser-\\nvations. We extensively tune the most important hyperparameters of all methods using Bayesian\\noptimization (Snoek et al., 2012). We report the mean and the standard deviation over six random\\nseeds for all experiments.\\n4.3\\nBENCHMARK USING STATE REPRESENTATION\\nWe present the results utilizing state representations in Table 3. Detailed information regarding\\nindividual state representations for the tasks can be found in Appendix A. Through an analysis of\\nthe performance and diversity across all methods, we outline our key findings below.\\nMultiple Strategies for Multi-Modal Behavior Learning. This section discusses various strate-\\ngies employed by different models for learning multi-modal behavior. Deterministic models like\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT have limitations in this regard since they can only generate a single solution\\ngiven an initial state s0. On the other hand, VAE-based models like VAE-State and VAE-ACT are\\ncapable of generating different behaviors, but they tend to exhibit low behavior entropy, presumably\\ndue to a phenomenon often referred to as \\u201dmode collapse\\u201d (Kingma & Welling, 2013). In contrast,\\nIBC, BeT, and diffusion-based models demonstrate the capacity to learn multi-modal distributions.\\nIBC, for instance, exhibits high diversity in tasks like Avoiding, Pushing, and Sorting-2, with en-\\ntropy levels slightly superior to DDPM-MLP. BeT is capable of learning diverse solutions for each\\ntask, but it comes with a significant performance drop when compared to the deterministic BC-GPT\\nbaseline. Notably, diffusion-based methods, especially those incorporating transformer backbones,\\nexcel in learning diverse behavior while maintaining strong performance across all tasks. To of-\\nfer additional insights, we include visual representations of the diverse solutions generated by each\\nmethod for the Avoiding task in Figure 10. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of hyper-\\nparameter sensitivity, which is discussed in Section B. This analysis provides a deeper understanding\\n6\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTable 3: Comparison between various Imitation Learning algorithms, some of which incorporate his-\\ntory (\\u2021), action chunking (\\u2020), or both using state representations (State Data) and image observations\\n(Visual Data). We present the mean and standard deviation across six random seeds, highlighting\\nthe best performance for both history-based and non-history-based models using bold formatting.\\nSuccess

Notably, our findings reveal\\nthat increasing the number of diffusion steps leads to a substantial enhancement in diversity while\\nmaintaining consistent task performance.\\nHistorical Inputs and Prediction Horizons are Important. A comparison of results between\\nBC-MLP and BC-GPT, VAE-State and VAE-ACT, BeT-MLP and BeT, DDPM-MLP and DDPM-\\nGPT reveals a notable trend: transformer-based methods consistently outperform their MLP-based\\ncounterparts. In particular, DDPM-GPT achieves an average 21% improvement in success rate\\nacross Avoiding, Aligning, and Pushing tasks compared to DDPM-MLP. While DDPM-MLP ex-\\nhibits higher entropy on the Aligning task, it lags behind on other tasks. When comparing VAE-\\nMLP to VAE-ACT, VAE-ACT demonstrates a success rate improvement of over 30% on most tasks,\\nindicating its effectiveness in capturing diverse behaviors. More significantly, transformers that\\nincorporate historical inputs or prediction horizons demonstrate the ability to tackle challenging\\ntasks like Sorting-4 and Stacking. However, the combination of historical information with ex-\\ntended prediction horizons (DDPM-ACT) does not appear to provide substantial benefits compared\\nto DDPM-GPT, which does not predict future actions.\\nScaling to More Complex Tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods excel in tasks such as Avoid-\\ning, Aligning, and Pushing; however, a notable performance gap emerges in Sorting and Stacking\\ntasks. In the case of Sorting, scaling with an increasing number of objects proves challenging for\\nall methods. Specifically, on the Sorting-6 task, none of the existing methods achieve satisfactory\\nperformance. The complexity of the observation space and task diversity significantly increases as\\nwe aggregate all box features into a single state vector. Consequently, there is a demand for models\\ncapable of learning compact and resilient state representations.\\n4.4\\nBENCHMARK USING IMAGE OBSERVATIONS\\nWe present the results utilizing image observations in Table 3. Detailed information regarding cam-\\nera setup can be found in Appendix A. Through an analysis of the performance and diversity across\\nall methods, we outline our key findings below.\\nComparison between State-Based and Image-Based Policies. State representations have proven\\nhighly effective for tasks demanding precise control (i.e. Aligning), but they do not scale with the\\nnumber of objects (i.e. Sorting). In such case, state-based approaches may struggle to exploit in-\\nvariances, which are essential for handling complex scenarios. Conversely, image representations\\nexhibit a notable capacity to handle scenarios involving multiple objects. However, image-based\\npolicy performs much worse than state-based policy on the Aligning task, which require precise\\ncontrol. The inherent difficulty in extracting fine-grained details and spatial relationships from im-\\nages makes it challenging in achieving precise manipulation.\\nTrade-off in Sequential Information Across Visual Tasks. From the results of state-based evalua-\\ntions, it is evident that historical inpu ...\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
