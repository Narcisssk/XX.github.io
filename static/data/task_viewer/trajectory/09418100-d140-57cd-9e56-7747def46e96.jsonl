{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Introduction\\nData from multiple sources describing the same subjects arises in a wealth of settings. This can be\\nclinical information of patients alongside genetic information and scan data. Datasets consisting of\\nmultiple views are referred to as multi-view or multi-modal data. There are instances where not all\\nviews are always available for every realisation. For example, a patient may miss an appointment\\nor machinery may falter, resulting in no reading for a specific view. Missing data results in smaller\\nusable datasets and reduced statistical power with many methods only applicable to full datasets\\n[1] and can result in reduced performance in downstream analysis [2]. This manuscript presents a\\nmulti-view imputation approach, where its aim is to impute the realisations of a missing view by\\nincorporating the information learnt from the other view.\\nThe proposed multi-view imputation method, named Joint Prior Variational Autoencoder (JPVAE), is\\nbased on variational autoencoders (VAEs) [3], with the views connected solely through a joint prior\\non the VAEs\\u2019 latent embeddings. Standard autoencoders seek to encode a latent representation of\\ndata, and from this encoding reconstruct the original data via a decoder. Multi-view approaches allow\\nthe latent representation of a missing view to be obtained, from which the reconstruction can be used\\nas an imputation of the missing view. Several multi-view imputation approaches exist in the literature\\nbased on autoencoders [4]. However, as variational autoencoders learn a continuous embedding,\\nthey provide better interpolation of the latent space than standard autoencoders, making them a\\nmore suitable approach for an imputation method. The proposed joint prior in JPVAE incorporates a\\nnon-zero correlation structure that is found to increase the observed correlation between views in the\\nlatent spaces. This allows for successful movement between latent spaces, improving the ability to\\nimpute missing views.\\nPreprint.\\nVarious approaches have been proposed extending VAEs to the multi view case, including those by\\n[5\\u20138], with missing data imputation included as a feature of these methods. Most recently, proposed\\nmethods differ via their method of approximating a joint posterior. Daunhawer et al. [9] discuss\\nthe undesirable upper bound these methods put on a lower limit of the log-likelihood used as the\\nobjective function in VAEs. In contrast to existing approaches, which largely assume some joint\\nposterior and\\/or shared latent space, our work has the novelty that is based on a joint prior between\\nthe latent variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt made to correlate the latent\\nspaces of VAEs natively through a joint prior.\\nJPVAE is most similar in structure to the private version of Deep Variational Canonical Correlation\\nAnalysis (VCCA-private), a multi-view VAE approach by Wang et al. [10]. However their model\\ncontains both private and shared variables in the latent space and doesn\\u2019t have a suitable approach for\\nimputing missing views. JPVAE can also be seen as an application of the ideas from self-supervised\\nlearning techniques such as Barlow Twins [11], where the embeddings from noisy versions of the\\nsame input are driven to be highly correlated via a loss function.\\nFigure 1 illustrates an application of the proposed approach JPVAE, on imputing view 2 of the data\\nthat corresponds to the bottom half of MNIST digits using the top half of the digits data (view 1).\\nThrough the proposed approach, reconstructions of missing views can be obtained. This is achieved\\nthrough the conditional distribution between the two latent variables, as illustrated in Figure 2. By\\nincorporating a joint prior with a non-zero cross-correlation structure, we observe better quality\\nresults in imputing view 2. Further realisations of image imputation, including imputation of view 1\\nfrom view 2, can be found in Appendix A.5.\\n(a) No correlation learnt, but estimated em-\\npirically after training\\n(b) Correlation learnt natively\\nFigure 1: Imputation of the bottom half of MNIST digits (view 2 of the data) using the top half of the\\nimage (view 1) on a JPVAE model trained with (a) independent priors (completely separate VAEs)\\nand (b) a joint prior with learnt correlation structure between latent spaces. The cross entropy loss\\nbetween true bottom half of image and imputation is 109.1 in (a) and 93.04 in (b). A classifier trained\\non the concatenation of the reconstruction of view 1 and imputation of view 2 achieves average testing\\naccuracy of 79.92% (1.0) in (a) and 87.45% (0.27) in (b). See Appendix A.5 for further details.\\n1.1\\nContributions\\nA novel multi-view imputation approach based on variational autoencoders, named JPVAE, is\\nproposed that in contrast to existing work assumes a joint prior between the latent variables.1 As the\\nmultiple views are correlated, the generated latent spaces are found also to be correlated. JPVAE\\n1The code for implementation of JPVAE and the numerical experiments contained in this manuscript can be\\nfound at https:\\/\\/github.com\\/eso28599\\/JPVAE.\\n2\\nFigure 2: Workflow to obtain reconstruction \\u02dc\\nx1 and imputation \\u02dc\\nx2|1 from input x1 only, on pre-\\ntrained JPVAE network. Trapeziums represent encoders\\/decoders and rectangles represent vectors.\\nThe structures for view 1 and 2 are shown in blue and orange respectively. The expectation step is\\nshown in red.\\ntakes advantage of this correlation and whilst marginals for each VAE are assumed to follow a\\nstandard normal distribution, a joint prior is assumed with a non-zero cross correlation. The imposed\\ncorrelation structure is learnt natively by forcing a stronger correlation in the latent space. Section\\n2 presents the proposed method and related theorems that showcase the validity of the proposed\\nmethod. As part of our work, we present and prove theorems that enable the parameterization of\\ndifferentiable positive definite matrices that allow end-to-end learning. Through our conducted\\nexperiments presented in Section 3, learning the correlation structure leads to improved imputation\\nability, lower reconstruction loss and better predictive likelihood. Imputed views from JPVAE can be\\nused for downstream tasks, with improved classification accuracy demonstrated. Lastly, better VAE\\nmodels are learnt with JPVAE preventing posterior collapse, a common problem observed with VAEs\\n[12].\\n1.2\\nNotation\\nThroughout this paper matrices are denoted by capital letters and column vectors are denoted by\\nlower case letters, both emboldened.

Therefore, developing a principled framework for fast deterministic\\/stochastic sampling for a broader class of diffusion models is a promising direction. We propose two complementary frameworks for accelerating sample generation in pre-trained models: Conjugate Integrators and Splitting Integrators. Conjugate integrators generalize DDIM, mapping the reverse diffusion dynamics to a more amenable space for sampling. In contrast, splitting-based integrators, commonly used in molecular dynamics, reduce the numerical simulation error by cleverly alternating between numerical updates involving the data and auxiliary variables. After extensively studying these methods empirically and theoretically, we present a hybrid method that leads to the best-reported performance for diffusion models in augmented spaces. Applied to Phase Space Langevin Diffusion [Pandey \\\\& Mandt, 2023] on CIFAR-10, our deterministic and stochastic samplers achieve FID scores of 2.11 and 2.36 in only 100 network function evaluations (NFE) as compared to 2.57 and 2.63 for the best-performing baselines, respectively.
