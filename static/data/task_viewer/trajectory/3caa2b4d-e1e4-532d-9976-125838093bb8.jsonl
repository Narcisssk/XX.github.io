{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, the integration of these models with financial datasets presents challenges, notably in determining their adeptness and relevance. This paper introduces a distinctive approach anchored in the Instruction Tuning paradigm for open-source large language models, specifically adapted for financial contexts. Through this methodology, we capitalize on the interoperability of open-source models, ensuring a seamless and transparent integration. We begin by explaining the Instruction Tuning paradigm, highlighting its effectiveness for immediate integration. The paper presents a benchmarking scheme designed for end-to-end training and testing, employing a cost-effective progression. Firstly, we assess basic competencies and fundamental tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentiment analysis to enhance specialization. Next, we delve into a comprehensive model, executing multi-task operations by amalgamating all instructional tunings to examine versatility. Finally, we explore the zero-shot capabilities by earmarking unseen tasks and incorporating novel datasets to understand adaptability in uncharted terrains. Such a paradigm fortifies the principles of openness and reproducibility, laying a robust foundation for future investigations in open-source financial large language models (FinLLMs).\",\"num_pages\":12,\"conference_full\":\"Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems\",\"conference_abbreviation\":\"NeurIPS\",\"pub_year\":2023,\"volume\":\"Instruction Workshop @ NeurIPS 2023\",\"download_url\":\"https:\\/\\/openreview.net\\/pdf\\/0d1fdb7d0131a1692996cee57ee13cf351314857.pdf\",\"bibtex\":\"@inproceedings{\\nwang2023fingpt,\\ntitle={Fin{GPT}: Instruction Tuning Benchmark for Open-Source Large Language Models in Financial Datasets},\\nauthor={Neng Wang and Hongyang Yang and Christina Wang},\\nbooktitle={NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Instruction Tuning and Instruction Following},\\nyear={2023},\\nurl={https:\\/\\/openreview.net\\/forum?id=FuOMomaQa8}\\n}\",\"authors\":\"['Neng Wang' 'Hongyang Yang' 'Christina Wang']\",\"pdf_path\":\"data\\/dataset\\/airqa\\/papers\\/neurips2023\\/1d2eb7a7-8dfa-5bc0-a906-b27725667ff4.pdf\",\"tldr\":\"FinGPT benchmarks instruction tuning for open-source large language models in finance.\",\"tags\":\"['Open-Source Large Language Models' 'Instruction Tuning Paradigm'\\n 'Financial Datasets' 'GPT-Based Models']\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

This subsection presents the performance evaluation of various\\nLLMs following multi-task Instruction Tuning, and it provides a comparative analysis between\\nmodels that underwent multi-task and task-specific tuning. Each model was trained on an aggregated\\ndataset encompassing SA, HC, NER, RE, NER(CLS), and RE(CLS). Table 3 displays the results on\\nthe SA task and its sub-datasets, while Table 4 shows the results for NER, HC, and RE tasks.\\nPerformance in Classification Tasks. In classification tasks, such as SA and HC, most models\\ndisplayed a minor decline in performance when concurrently trained with unrelated tasks. An\\nexception to this trend, Qwen consistently enhanced its performance across all SA sub-datasets.\\nAdditionally, Falcon also showed improvement in specific areas. Conversely, BLOOM, which already\\nhad limited success during the task-specific tuning phase, suffered the most substantial performance\\ndegradation in classification tasks after multi-task tuning.\\nPerformance in Information Extraction Tasks. The scenario differs for information extraction\\ntasks like NER and RE. For RE, all models exhibited significant improvement, likely due to the\\nincorporation of RE(CLS) and additional financial NLP tasks, suggesting potential under-fitting\\nduring the task-specific tuning phase. While Llama2 and MPT exhibited progress in NER, not all\\nmodels mirrored this improvement. Notably, these two models also displayed the most substantial\\nenhancements in RE. BLOOM, in particular, made significant strides, outperforming Falcon and\\nreaffirming its dominance in information extraction tasks.\\nModel Improvement Analysis. Despite its unsatisfying performance in the task-specific phase,\\nMPT registered the most significant improvement in both NER and RE tasks, while Falcon and Chat-\\nGLM2 experienced moderate gains in both tasks, further underlining the interconnected performance\\ndynamics in similar tasks.\\nSummary of Findings. Llama2 and MPT not only displayed versatility by excelling in various tasks\\nbut also benefited from the multi-task learning environment. While models like Falcon, ChatGLM2,\\nand Qwen maintained their baseline performances, BLOOM managed to enhance its strengths\\nminimally. However, its weaknesses became more pronounced in a multi-task setting.\\nDataset\\nLlama2\\nFalcon\\nMPT\\nBLOOM\\nChatGLM2\\nQwen\\nFPB\\n0.621\\n0.791\\n0.599\\n0.576\\n0.803\\n0.576\\nFiQA\\n0.565\\n0.625\\n0.591\\n0.517\\n0.631\\n0.517\\nTable 5: Zero-shot Sentiment Analysis Results: The zero-shot F1-scores on the Sentiment Analysis\\ntest datasets are reported for all base models.

This subsection delineates the results of our examination on the\\nzero-shot abilities of LLMs post-Instruction Tuning. For this evaluation, the LLMs were trained on\\nthree distinct classification tasks: HC, NER(CLS), and RE(CLS). Initially, we endeavored to employ\\nthe original NER and RE tasks for training purposes. However, these did not sufficiently activate the\\nmodels\\u2019 zero-shot abilities due to insufficient instruction diversity. This limitation led to issues such\\nas model hallucination and inconsistency in response to the provided options.\\nTask Reformulation to Mitigate Hallucination. To mitigate this, we reformulated NER and RE\\ntasks into classification tasks, thereby narrowing the task gap with the target SA task. Furthermore,\\nconsidering the challenge in distinguishing between neutral sentiments and positive\\/negative ones in\\na zero-shot setting, all samples labeled \\\"neutral\\\" were excluded from the study.\\nComparative Performance Insights. Table 5 presents the mean F1-score results for FiQA and FPB.\\nChatGLM2 stood out in zero-shot tasks, likely due to its chat-centric tuning. Falcon followed closely\\nin overall performance. Llama2 and MPT, while lagging behind ChatGLM2 and Falcon, showed\\npromise in classifying a subset of the samples. However, both BLOOM and Qwen struggled, often\\nmisclassifying responses as \\\"positive\\\". BLOOM\\u2019s results were expected given its past struggles with\\nclassification, but Qwen\\u2019s suboptimal performance was surprising.\\nGeneralization Capability Insights. These findings are particularly illuminating as neither Chat-\\nGLM2 nor Falcon excelled in the task-specific and multi-task Instruction Tuning phases but demon-\\nstrated significant generalization capabilities, understanding unseen instructions, and making accurate\\nclassifications during the zero-shot tasks.\\n6\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
