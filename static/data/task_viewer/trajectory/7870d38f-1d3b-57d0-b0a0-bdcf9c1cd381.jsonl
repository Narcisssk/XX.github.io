{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Language models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and CM3 (Aghajanyan et al., 2022), have seen unprecedented adoption in diverse sectors ranging from education and healthcare to manufacturing and marketing. The profciency of these tools has led to unprecedented demand for these models, with users facing frequent outages and capacity limits. Additionally, ever-increasing model sizes and hardware shortages have constrained models\\u2019 ability to handle a very high load of requests, thus limiting large-scale affordable access to these models. These trends bring into focus the need for high-throughput, high-performance, effcient, and environmentally responsible models that can be deployed at scale to meet the quickly growing demand.\\n\\nMulti-input Multi-output architectures (MIMO) (Havasi et al., 2021; Ram\\u00e9 et al., 2021; Murahari et al., 2022) are a promising hardware-agnostic and architecture-agnostic paradigm that perform inference for multiple inputs simultaneously at the cost of a single input. This effciency paradigm is natively geared towards yielding high-throughput models, in addition to being complementary in approach and motivation to current effciency methods such as pruning, quantization, and distillation. Interestingly, MIMO approaches are partly inspired by the human brain\\u2019s extraordinary ability to process multiple inputs and propagate information at a high bandwidth with a few neural codes (Blumhagen et al., 2011; Akam and Kullmann, 2014; Pirschel and Kretzberg, 2016; Hong et al., 2016; Friedrich et al., 2004).\\nMurahari et al. (2022) introduced data multiplexing, a MIMO technique that can enable a many-fold increase in throughput. The method compresses $N$ different instances into a single \\u201cmultiplexed\\u201d hidden representation before decompressing it into $N$ independent predictions. While they show the plausibility of MIMO training, their method leads to a signifcant drop in performance $(20\\\\mathrm{~-~}30\\\\%$ points) compared to state-of-the-art models.\\nIn this work, we introduce MUX-PLMs, a class of high-throughput pre-trained language models trained in a MIMO fashion with data multiplexing to process multiple inputs (2-10) simultaneously with a forward pass over a single instance. MUX-PLMs offer up to $400\\\\%$ improvement in throughput over baseline pre-trained models while only being $\\\\sim4$ points and $\\\\sim2$ points worse than baseline pre-trained language models for text classifcation and token classifcation tasks, respectively. MUX-PLMs, like other pre-trained language models, provide general model initialization that can be fne-tuned for any downstream task. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our MUX-PLMs class of pre-trained models by training MUX-BERT and MUX-ELECTRA models, which are trained with pre-trained objectives adapted from BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2020) respectively, although in a MIMO fashion with data multiplexing.\\n\\nOur work is the frst to introduce MIMO architectures to PLMs. To enable this, we frst develop a new demultiplexing module, RSA-demux (Figure 2), that randomly initializes and learns private key vectors to recover the multiple outputs from a multiplexed representation. Secondly, we introduce a new Contextual Multiplexer module (Figure 3) that uses a cross-instance attention-based mechanism to aggregate context across the set of multiplexed instances, which seems to be particularly effective for token-level tasks. Thirdly, our three-stage training algorithm (Figure 1) enables stable and effcient training of MUX-PLMs.\\nImportantly, MUX-PLMs are complementary to existing state-of-the-art model compression techniques. We hope our work validates MIMO architectures as a promising complementary direction to existing effciency techniques. Consequently, we hope future research develops MIMO architectures in tandem with other effciency approaches, leveraging the best of both paradigms. We publicly release our models and code to promote opensource research on the next generation of MIMO architectures for large language models.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"7 Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"We introduce MUX-PLMs, a class of highthroughput pre-trained language models trained with data multiplexing, a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) architecture.
