{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2 Main Results\",\"section_content\":\"We evaluate the performance of our decoding scheme, denoted as \\u2018Self-Speculative\\u2019, with both greedy decoding (temperature $=0.0$ ) and random sampling (temperature $=0.2\\/0.6)$ , across text and code generation. The baseline is \\u2018Autoregressive\\u2019, which uses the original model to perform standard autoregressive decoding. The experiments involve various scales of LLaMA-2 and its fne-tuned models. The results can be found in Tables 1 and 2. We visualize the layer skipping distribution for different models in Section 4.8.\\nFor text generation tasks, Table 1 shows that our method, when applied with temperature settings of 0.0 and 0.2 achieves considerable speedups ranging from $1.210\\\\times$ to ${\\\\bf1.992\\\\times}$ . Another important observation from these results is the minimal to nonexistent loss in ROUGE- $\\\\cdot2^{5}$ , which verifes a core advantage of our decoding scheme, namely consistent output quality. In Appendix J.1, we compare the ROUGE-2 with other mainstream LLMs and evaluate the various metrics (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L) to quantitatively show our output quality. Moreover, the case study in Appendix J.2 qualitatively presents consistent output examples. In particular, our approach can be effectively applied on LLaMA-2-13B-Chat, a fne-tuned LLaMA-2-13B for conversation scenarios, indicating the compatibility of our method with fne-tuned models. This effectively addresses the dependency of the original speculative decoding method on high-quality draft models, which can be challenging to train and obtain, especially for fne-tuned models. Furthermore, the higher speedup achieved on LLaMA-2- 70B suggests that larger models introduce more redundancy. This allows the drafting stage to skip a larger percentage of intermediate layers, thereby enhancing the overall speedup.\\n\\nWe also tested CodeLLaMA-13B, another fnetuned LLaMA-2-13B for code generation. The performance on larger CodeLLaMA-34B is presented in Appendix I. We used the HumanEval benchmark. Table 2 shows that we achieve speedups of $1.345\\\\times$ and $1.456\\\\times$ , respectively, while maintaining similar task scores in terms of pass $@1$ and pass $@10$ . This further validates the compatibility of our scheme for coding.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"K Discussion of Pre-defned Anchor\",\"section_content\":\"Here, we discuss why we do not use a predefned speedup ratio, but a predefned acceptance rate (target acceptance rate) in the adaptive draft exit mechanism. The pre-defned acceptance rate is related to the quality while the pre-defned speedup ratio is related to the effciency. It seems that these two anchors do not confict and correspond to different application scenarios. The predefned speedup ratio is an interesting idea, but using a predefned speedup as an anchor seems diffcult to apply to real-world testing. In the self-speculative decoding process, adapting the exit threshold based on the current acceleration ratio and predefned speedup ratio involves signifcant computational overhead.\\n\\nTo elaborate, for each instance, we would need frst to employ autoregressive decoding to obtain its generation time and then execute self-speculative decoding to calculate the current acceleration ratio. This sequential process would substantially reduce the generation speed. In contrast, the adaptive exit mechanism based on the acceptance rate doesn\\u2019t entail such dependencies. The current acceptance rate can be directly obtained after completing a draft and verifcation process.\\nMoreover, compared to the predefned speedup ratio, which can be any number greater than 1, the target acceptance rate is a value ranging from 0 to 1 (usually greater than 0.7). This range is straightforward to determine for different tasks and models.\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
