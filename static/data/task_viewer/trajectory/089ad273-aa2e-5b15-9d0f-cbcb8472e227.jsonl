{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In contrast to sentencelevel translation, document-level translation (DOCMT) by LLMs based on in-context learning faces two major challenges: (1) document translations generated by LLMs are often incoherent; (2) the length of demonstration for in-context learning is usually limited. To address these issues, we propose a ContextAware Prompting method (CAP), which enables LLMs to generate more accurate, cohesive, and coherent translations via in-context learning. CAP takes into account multi-level attention, selects the most relevant sentences to the current one as context, and then generates a summary from these collected sentences. Subsequently, sentences most similar to the summary are retrieved from the datastore as demonstrations, which effectively guide LLMs in generating cohesive and coherent translations. We conduct extensive experiments across various DOCMT tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in zero pronoun translation (ZPT) and literary translation tasks.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"With the increasing scale of parameters and training corpus, large language models (LLMs) have gained remarkable abilities to handle a variety of tasks via in-context learning (Li et al., $2023\\\\mathbf{a}$ ; Wang et al., 2023b), which allows language models to perform tasks with a few given demonstrations and humanwritten prompts as context. One particular area where LLMs have shown outstanding potential is machine translation (MT) (Moslem et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a,b; Gao et al., 2024). However, most existing studies (Zhu et al., 2024) have focused on sentence-level translation, which makes\\nLLM-based document-level machine translation underexplored (Wang et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2024). To bridge this gap, we adapt LLMs to documentlevel machine translation (DOCMT) in this paper.\\nAs a complex task different from sentence-level translation, one major challenge of DOCMT with LLMs is that the length of demonstrations for in-context learning is limited. For sentence-level MT, Agrawal et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2023a) show that using 32 or more randomly sampled bilingual parallel sentence pairs as prompts can effectively enhance the translation abilities of LLMs. However, for DOCMT, the length of the text segments to be translated or to be used as demonstrations inherently increase (Zeng et al., 2024). Consequently, the limited input window of large language models poses a signifcant obstacle (Pawar et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2023). Unlike sentence-level translation, the constraints of DOCMT hinder the seamless integration of such demonstrations. Moreover, the lengthier nature of document-level inputs exacerbates issues related to inference speed. As the length of the demonstrations increases, the computational resources required for processing also escalate, potentially impeding real-time translation capabilities.\\nPrevious efforts to DOCMT with LLMs, e.g., the method presented in (Wu et al., 2024), involve fne-tuning LLMs using two strategies: ParameterEffcient Fine-Tuning and Full Parameter FineTuning. Such a framework may not be able to suffciently overcome the limitation of the length of demonstration for in-context learning in LLMs. And it also reveals a signifcant issue: contextindependent translations, which can result in translations that lack coherence and disambiguation (Zhang et al., 2022a; Mac\\u00e9 and Servan, 2019).\\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel method called CAP, which stands for ContextAware Prompting. It consists of three essential steps. Firstly, by combining token- and sentencelevel attention scores, we obtain sentences with the highest sentence-level attention scores as context for each sentence. This step facilitates LLMs in generating coherent translations. Secondly, to address the limitation of the length of demonstration for in-context learning in LLMs, we summarize the context and retrieve parallel sentences from the datastore, which are most similar to the generated summary. Finally, we use the retrieved example pairs as demonstrations, prompting LLMs to produce document translations.\\n\\nIn summary, the contributions of this work are as follows:\\n\\u2022 We investigate document-level translation via LLMs. Specially, we explore linguistic phenomena in document-level translation with LLMs, such as ZPT.\\n\\u2022 We propose a novel method, CAP, to enable LLMs to perform accurate and coherent translation via in-context learning. Our method addresses the issue of translation coherence defciency by employing a dynamic context window and resolves the limitation concerning the length of demonstration for in-context learning by summarizing the context. \\u2022 To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on various DOCMT tasks. Experimental results show that our method signifcantly outperforms the baselines, especially for the ZPT task.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Document-Level Machine Translation In recent years, numerous approaches have been proposed for DOCMT (Maruf et al., 2022; Lei et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022b; Tan et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2020b). These studies could be further roughly categorized into two groups. Studies of the frst group extend the source-side context from a sentence to the local context of few sentences (Tan et al., 2021; Lyu et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021). Studies of the second group have focused on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation. The initial exploration of Doc2Doc NMT has involved concatenating multiple sentences into a single unit (Ma et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Tan et al., 2019). Recent studies have successfully trained vanilla Transformer models for Doc2Doc translation by leveraging either large augmented datasets (Lupo et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022) or pre-trained models (Yang et al.,\\n2021). Additionally, some latest work has achieved the truly Doc2Doc translation by enhancing the attention mechanism in the Transformer model (Bao et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b).\\nTranslation Oriented LLMs LLMs have demonstrated remarkable profciency across a wide range of NLP tasks (Scao et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Sun and Xiong, 2022; Min et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2022). Recent research has shown that in-context learning can signifcantly enhance their performance when following general language instructions. Specifcally, there is a growing body of work exploring the translation capabilities of LLMs (Lu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., $2023\\\\mathrm{a}$ ; Hendy et al., 2023). However, it is important to note that these efforts have primarily focused on sentencelevel machine translation and have not delved into DOCMT (Wu et al., 2024). Latest noteworthy studies in DOCMT are conducted by Wu et al. (2024) and Wang et al. (2023a). Wang et al. (2023a) investigate the document-level translation capabilities of GPT-3.5-TURBO, making it the most closely related work to ours that explores the DOCMT ability of LLMs. Wu et al. (2024) explore fne-tuning LLMs using two strategies: Parameter-Effcient Fine-Tuning and Full Parameter Fine-Tuning, to enhance the DOCMT ability of LLMs. Such a framework may not be able to suffciently overcome the limitation of the length of demonstration for incontext learning in LLMs. We observe that the existing translation-oriented LLMs tend to struggle with effectively translating sentences in the middle and ending of a document. Existing methods that explore DOCMT with LLMs are rarely considering the issues of (1) the length limitation of demonstrations for in-context learning and (2) maintaining coherence and resolving ambiguities. In this work, we mainly concentrate on mitigating the length limitation of in-context learning for DOCMT and addressing the issues of incoherence and ambiguity in DOCMT with LLMs.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 CAP: Context-Aware Prompting\",\"section_content\":\"In this section, to address the challenges associated with utilizing LLMs for DOCMT via in-context learning, we propose a Context-Aware Prompting method.\\nAs shown in Figure 1, our approach consists of three steps. Firstly, we take into consideration multi-level attention, subsequently opting for the sentences with the highest sentence-level attention scores as the context. Secondly, we input the context into an LLM to obtain its summary, then retrieve $K$ example pairs from the datastore, which are most similar to the summary. Thirdly, we use the retrieved example pairs as demonstrations in the prompt, guiding the model to generate accurate and coherent translations through a few-shot approach.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Dynamic Context Window\",\"section_content\":\"In the context of document-level translation for LLMs, issues of incoherence and disambiguation may arise, leading to context-independent translations. In order to address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Context Window as a solution. By extracting the most attended context surrounding the current sentence, it facilitates the model in generating accurate and coherent translation outputs.\\nInitially, we meticulously devise a method for computing sentence-level attention. Specifcally, as demonstrated in Eq. (1), we extract the attention weights from the fnal layer of the LLM, followed by averaging across all attention heads to obtain the token-token attention scores. Next, as illustrated in\\nEq. (2), the maximum value of token-token attention scores between tokens in the current sentence and tokens in all other sentences is computed as the token-sentence attention score. Ultimately, as shown in Eq. (3), the average of attention scores between all tokens in the current sentence and other sentences is calculated to derive the sentence-level attention score.\\nwhere $\\\\mathrm{TS}_{\\\\mathrm{i,S}}$ is the attention score of Token i and Sentence S, $\\\\mathrm{SS_{I,S}}$ is the attention score between Sentence I and Sentence S. $a t t{n_{i,j}^{h}}$ denotes the attention score of the $h$ -th head in the fnal transformer block, calculated between the $i$ -th token and the $j$ -th token in the current document. $H$ is the number of attention heads in each transformer block.\\nAfter obtaining the sentence-level attention scores, we extract the top $N$ sentences with the highest sentence-level attention scores as dynamic context, while maintaining their original sequential positions within the document.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Example-Specifc In-Context Demonstrations Selection\",\"section_content\":\"Unlike sentence-level translation, the challenge in utilizing LLMs for DOCMT arises from the constrained context length, as the length of the text segments to be translated or used as demonstrations inherently increases. To effectively address these challenges, it is necessary to further process the context and extract as much relevant information as possible from the preceding sentences. We then input this extracted context into an LLM to generate a concise summary that encapsulates key topics and information.\\nSubsequently, as shown in Eq. (4), we utilize sentence-transformers (Reimers and Gurevych, 2020) to retrieve carefully designed example pairs from a specifed datastore. These examples are selected based on their cosine similarity with the embedding of the summary sentences, ensuring that the retrieved examples exhibit semantic similarity to the context and content of the document.\\nwhere $S$ , and $X$ are the summary we obtained at the preceding step and the example sentence in datastore respectively. $\\\\boldsymbol{S}$ and $\\\\boldsymbol{X}$ are the embeddings of $S$ and $X$ respectively.\\nBy employing these selected examples as fewshot demonstrations, we provide the LLM with a more precise understanding of the document.

This multifaceted evaluation allows us to gain comprehensive insights into the effectiveness and performance of the language models in producing accurate and appropriate translations.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Experiments\",\"section_content\":\"In this section, we conducted extensive experiments on various DOCMT tasks to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.1 Setup\",\"section_content\":\"Datasets: We used OPUS- $100^{1}$ and newscommentary-v15 as the datastore to retrieve the in-context demonstrations on four language pairs.

Following (Agrawal et al., 2023), we normalized punctuation using Moses2 and removed sentence pairs with a source\\/target length ratio exceeding 1.5. To assess the accuracy of our method in ZPT, we utilized the GuoFeng (Xu et al., 2022) dataset, which covers fve domains: movie subtitle, Q&A forum, government news, web fction, and personal profle. To validate the capability of our approach in guiding the model to generate more cohesive and more coherent translations, we employed the WMT23 Literary Translation dataset,3 which comprises two test sets: an in-domain test set and an out-of-domain test set. Additionally, we used its training set to retrieve in-context demonstrations.\\nModels: To compare the translation performance of LLMs using our method, we compared against the following three encoder-decoder based strong NMT models as baselines.\\n\\u2022 MarianMT: A framework for translation models, using the same models as BART (Lewis et al., 2020).

There are numerous variants of it, and the one utilized in our experiments is NLLB-3.3B.\\nTo evaluate the translation abilities of LLMs, we utilized LLMs that are tuned with SFT, as they can follow instructions to generate translations. Hence, we chose the following two LLMs, which support both Chinese and English and have undergone instruction tuning:\\n\\u2022 Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023): It is trained on a high-quality corpus with 2.6 trillion tokens and has achieved the best performance in authoritative Chinese and English benchmarks of the same size.\\nQwen (Bai et al., 2023): It is pretrained on over 3 trillion tokens, including Chinese, English, multilingual texts, code, and mathematics, covering general and professional felds.\\nPrompt Selection Strategies: To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared our method against fve prompt selection strategies:\\n\\u2022 Zero-shot: Zero-shot is a powerful baseline.

For the ZPT task, we employed accuracy to evaluate the precision of zero pronoun translation. Additionally, we have also evaluated document-level translation quality with Blonde (Jiang et al., 2022), which is an automatic evaluation metric for document-level machine translation.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"4.1 Setup\",\"section_content\":\"Datasets: We used OPUS- $100^{1}$ and newscommentary-v15 as the datastore to retrieve the in-context demonstrations on four language pairs. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method on LLMs, we employed WMT22 newstest as the test set. Following (Agrawal et al., 2023), we normalized punctuation using Moses2 and removed sentence pairs with a source\\/target length ratio exceeding 1.5. To assess the accuracy of our method in ZPT, we utilized the GuoFeng (Xu et al., 2022) dataset, which covers fve domains: movie subtitle, Q&A forum, government news, web fction, and personal profle. To validate the capability of our approach in guiding the model to generate more cohesive and more coherent translations, we employed the WMT23 Literary Translation dataset,3 which comprises two test sets: an in-domain test set and an out-of-domain test set. Additionally, we used its training set to retrieve in-context demonstrations.\\nModels: To compare the translation performance of LLMs using our method, we compared against the following three encoder-decoder based strong NMT models as baselines.\\n\\u2022 MarianMT: A framework for translation models, using the same models as BART (Lewis et al., 2020). In our experiment, each language pair is associated with a distinct pre-trained model.\\n\\u2022 M2M100 (Fan et al., 2021): It is a multilingual encoder-decoder model, which is pretrained on 100 languages and is capable of translating 9,900 directions.\\n\\u2022 NLLB (Costa-juss\\u00e0 et al., 2022): It is a neural multilingual machine translation model, which supports translation between any pair of 200 languages. There are numerous variants of it, and the one utilized in our experiments is NLLB-3.3B.\\nTo evaluate the translation abilities of LLMs, we utilized LLMs that are tuned with SFT, as they can follow instructions to generate translations. Hence, we chose the following two LLMs, which support both Chinese and English and have undergone instruction tuning:\\n\\u2022 Baichuan (Yang et al., 2023): It is trained on a high-quality corpus with 2.6 trillion tokens and has achieved the best performance in authoritative Chinese and English benchmarks of the same size.\\nQwen (Bai et al., 2023): It is pretrained on over 3 trillion tokens, including Chinese, English, multilingual texts, code, and mathematics, covering general and professional felds.\\nPrompt Selection Strategies: To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared our method against fve prompt selection strategies:\\n\\u2022 Zero-shot: Zero-shot is a powerful baseline. Previous studies (Radford et al., 2019) show that LLMs have excellent zero-shot abilities in many NLP tasks, including reading comprehension, translation, and summarization.   \\n\\u2022 Random: This strategy randomly selects $K$ sentence pairs from the datastore as demonstrations.   \\n\\u2022 BM25: It calculates the similarity between translated sentences and sentences in the corpus with BM25, and then selects top $K$ sentences with the highest similarity as demonstrations.   \\n\\u2022 Similar: This method uses sentence embedding similarity-based retrieval to select $K$ demonstrations (Moslem et al., 2023). In our work, we used sentence-transformers (Reimers and Gurevych, 2020) to implement this method.   \\n\\u2022 Precedent: This approach guides large language models in generating translations by utilizing the preceding $K$ sentences of the current sentence within a document, along with those translations generated in previous steps as demonstrations.\\n\\nFor prompt selection experiments, we employed models from four distinct sizes of the Qwen LLMs. Meanwhile, for a trade-off between performance and cost, we set $K$ to 3.\\nMetrics: We employed a variety of metrics to assess the quality of document-level translation generated by LLMs, including document-level BLEU( $d$ -BLEU), and ChrF2 using SacreBLEU for document-level evaluation. For the ZPT task, we employed accuracy to evaluate the precision of zero pronoun translation. Additionally, we have also evaluated document-level translation quality with Blonde (Jiang et al., 2022), which is an automatic evaluation metric for document-level machine translation. More experimental results can be found in Appendix A.\\nAll experiments were performed on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

As shown in Table 2, the results show that when the model size is large enough, the translation abilities of LLMs comprehensively exceed those of dedicated translation models. This is observed except in the en-de language pair, where we attribute the discrepancy to the insuffcient understanding of the German language by the Baichuan and Qwen models, primarily trained on Chinese and English corpora. Specifcally, in the en-zh translation direction where Baichuan and Qwen excel, the translation results of LLMs signifcantly surpass those of specialized models.\\nMoreover, our experiments reveal interesting insights into the impact of model size on translation performance. As expected, larger LLMs, such as Qwen-72B-Chat, consistently outperforms smaller counterparts across various language pairs and evaluation metrics. This trend demonstrates the importance of model scale in harnessing the full potential of LLMs for translation tasks.\\nHowever, the most striking fnding is the competitive performance of small LLMs, particularly those with parameters in the 7B to 14B range. Despite their smaller size compared to their larger counterparts, these models exhibit translation capabilities on par with or even outperforming dedicated translation models. This suggests that with an appropriate prompt strategy, small LLMs can offer a cost-effective solution for translation tasks. Our method has improved document translation performance on different LLMs, further verifying the robustness of our method. This underscores the generality and effciency of our approach in leveraging LLMs for translation tasks across diverse domains and languages.\"}\n\nIn total, 2 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
