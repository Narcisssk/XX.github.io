{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

INTRODUCTION\",\"section_content\":\"The rapid growth of video data brings non-ignorable challenges to the effcient browsing and retrieval of videos [1]. Against this background, video summarization has increasingly attracted research interests, which allows for generating a concise version to convey comprehensive information about the input video by removing redundant parts.\\nTypically, existing methods can be classifed into two categories: frame-based video summarization [2, 3] and shotbased video summarization [4, 5]. Frame-based methods generate summaries by selecting several static frames while shot-based methods pick segments with consecutive frames as summaries. This paper focuses on shot-based methods, as consecutive frames are more benefcial to video understanding.\\n\\nRecently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are usually exploited to model contextual information within videos since they are capable of easily processing variable-range data. However, RNN-based methods [6, 4, 7] can only recursively process frames or shots within videos, which obstructs the parallelization implementation. Additionally, much valuable information might be discarded, and gradient vanishing problems usually occur when processing long-range sequential data due to their unique working mechanism [8]. To solve these problems, Rochan et al. [9] proposed a convolutionbased model while it cannot model both local and global temporal dependencies simultaneously, which is actually of great essence to video understanding. This aspect has been noticed in [10, 11], which adopt the hierarchical structure starting from modeling local temporal cues within subsequences. Nevertheless, this rough sequence division might result in confusion in local information learning, which in turn cascades to negatively affect global information. Moreover, visual representation capability is also indispensable to video summarization. Previous contributions tend to use pre-trained visual features extracted from deep classifcation networks (e.g., GoogLeNet) to conduct downstream steps. Owing to the limitation of the classifcation task, these pre-trained feature extractors might be insuffcient to model discriminative and informative visual representations suitable for video summarization.\\nIn this work, we present M2SUM, a novel deep learningbased pipeline benefcial for effective context representation learning. As shown in Fig. 1, M2SUM is composed of three dominant components including the embedding learning attention (ELA) module, multi-granularity aggregator (MGA), and semantic scale-adaption (SSA) module. ELA aims to dynamically enhance the pre-trained visual features by estimating the visual relationship across frame-level and video-level embeddings. This module is easy to be combined with our architecture for end-to-end training. MGA inherits the merits of self-attention and temporal convolution, which intends to enrich visual representations with both global and local contextual information. Compared with previous works, our method can robustly capture coarse-grained and multiple fnegrained temporal features to fully grasp the video storyline, without being affected by cascading caused by inappropriate sequence partitioning. Furthermore, considering the scale difference across global and local temporal features, SSA adaptively fuses these temporal representations by learning fusion attention instead of using simple fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on the SumMe and TVSum datasets have proved the effectiveness and superiority of our method in F-score and rank-based evaluations.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, we have the following contributions. (1) We propose the ELA module to ensure powerful visual representations, which provide more valuable and discriminative information regarding videos for subsequent temporal cues capture. (2) We devise MGA, which inherits the merits of self-attention and temporal convolution and can robustly enrich visual features with both global and local contextual information. (3) We refect on the scale difference across global and local contextual information, adopting SSA to achieve adequate context fusion for better video summarization.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2. Comparisons with State-of-the-Art Methods\",\"section_content\":\"Comparisons in the F-score Evaluation. As reported in Table 1, our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under most evaluation settings. Specifcally, it achieves the best summarization performance on the SumMe dataset and yields comparable results with other methods on the TVSum dataset. Although RSGN [7] and VJMHT [16] reach state-ofthe-art scores under the transfer and augment settings on the TVSum dataset, their performance is comparable or even signifcantly inferior to our method under the remaining settings. In addition, the number of parameters of M2SUM ranks second lowest among all methods and signifcantly lower than most methods, which showcases an impressive trade-off between performance and the number of parameters.\\nComparisons in the Rank-based Evaluation. We also compare our method with other methods using the rank-based correlation coeffcients, which overcomes the limitations of the F-score evaluation and becomes a more trustworthy evaluation metric.

Secondly, MGA is embedded in our architecture to model contextual information within videos and the summarization performance is further remarkably improved. After obtaining both coarse-grained and fne-grained temporal cues, we implement intuitive fusion strategies including summation (Sum.), concatenation (Concat.), and the proposed SSA. We can observe that SSA performs better than other fusion methods by a large margin owing to its unique working mechanism of adaptive fusion. In brief, these experimental results provide strong support for the necessity of each component.\\n\\nStudy on Multi-granularity Information.
