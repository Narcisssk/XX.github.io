{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The accu-\\nracy of event-argument relation extraction (EAE)\\nshall be presented in section 9.\\nNotably,\\nour\\nNLI\\nmodel\\nachieves\\nhigh\\nF1scores across all event relations, with the\\nhasDate relation exhibiting the highest score\\n(96.44%).\\nAdditionally,\\nthe negative rela-\\ntions also achieved a notably high F1 score of\\n95.29%, indicating the model\\u2019s effectiveness in\\nrecognizing entities unrelated to the event.\\nTo validate this remarkable performance of the\\nmodel and to test its generalization, we con-\\nstructed a new corpus and conducted additional\\nout-of-domain experiments.\\n8\\nAdditional WojoodOutOfDomain Dataset\\nTo evaluate the model\\u2019s generalization and its ro-\\nbustness to contexts beyond the WojoodHadath do-\\nmains, we constructed a new out-of-domain cor-\\npus (referred to as the WojoodOutOfDomain corpus).\\nWe then extracted an NLI dataset and used it for\\nmodel testing.\\n8.1\\nCorpus Preparation\\nThis corpus covers 10 distinct domains:\\neco-\\nnomics, finance, politics, science, technology, art,\\nlaw, agriculture, history, and sports each contain-\\ning nearly 8k tokens. The corpus covers events\\nfrom 2010 to 2022, manually collected from news\\nwebsites such as Aljazeera, and Alarabiya, total-\\ning 80k tokens.\\nWe used the same Wojood annotation guide-\\nlines to maintain consistency. Table 8 shows the\\nnumber of instances for each relationship type.\\n8.2\\nConstruct WojoodOutOfDomain Dataset\\nAn\\nNLI\\ndataset\\nwas\\ngenerated\\nfrom\\nWo-\\njoodOutOfDomain using the same methodology as Ha-\\ndathNLI, employing only the templates designated\\nfor testing, resulting in a total of 1124 pairs. De-\\ntailed statistics are provided in Table 9.\\n8.3\\nExperiments and Results\\nThe WojoodOutOfDomain is used to evaluate the EAE\\nmodel, which was trained on the HadathNLI.\\nThe results, presented in Table 10, highlight\\nthe model\\u2019s robust generalization across diverse\\ndomains, despite encountering challenges like\\ndomain-specific vocabulary and linguistic nu-\\nances. Despite a slight performance decline com-\\npared to the HadathNLI test set, the model main-\\ntained a high overall average F1\\u2212score of 83.38%\\non the WojoodOutOfDomain.\\n9\\nEnd-to-End System for EAE\\n9.1\\nSystem Architecture\\nThis section introduces our novel end-to-end EAE\\nsystem, which efficiently extracts event-related in-\\nformation from text by seamlessly identifying en-\\ntity boundaries, determining their types, and rec-\\nognizing argument entities and their relations to\\nan event entity. We utilized the EAE NLI model\\nto construct the system. As illustrated in Figure 6,\\nthe overall steps are:\\nNamed Entity Recognition Module: The system\\nstarts by extracting entities and their types from\\nthe input sentence.\\nThe process is carried out\\nthrough the online Wojood web service3.
