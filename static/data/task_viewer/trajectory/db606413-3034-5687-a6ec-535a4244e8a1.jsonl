{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.4.2 Multi-view Results Aggregation\",\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

As shown in Table 2, we observe that:\\n1) By aggregating results from multiple views, MVP surpasses the most of previous single-order methods. In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference. Compared with DLO augmenting data on the target side, MVP obtains an improvement of $1.34\\\\%$ by generating tuples controllably with designed element order-based prompts.\\n\\n3) MVP can be applied without abundant pretraining simply and achieves better performance. It is notable that MVP trained on T5-base exceeds UIE using T5-v1.1-base and subsequently trained on a large corpus with 65M instances on all datasets of ASTE $(+1.00$ on average).\\nMulti-task Learning. By permutation and combination, MVP (multi-task) obtains generalized ability among diverse tasks. Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2 Low-resource Results\",\"section_content\":\"To further explore the behavior of our methods in low-resource settings, we train Paraphrase, DLO, MVP using $1\\\\%$ , $2\\\\%$ , $5\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $20\\\\%$ of 4 different training sets in 2 domains over 4 tasks. The F1 scores of test sets are reported in Table 3. We fnd that MVP, with effcient prompts from different views, achieves better results than previous works with only a small number of samples. In particular, MVP outperforms Paraphrase and DLO substantially in all settings with a performance boost of $5.70\\\\%$ and $3.87\\\\%$ F1 on average.\\nCross-task transfer. Based on MVP, transfer brings further signifcant improvements, from triplets to quadruplets and vice versa. MVP (transfer) performs relatively well in extremely lowresource situations, thus exceeding strong baselines under cross-task transfer situations, both in-domain and cross-domain. Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD). Rather than capture task-specifc features, MVP effectively shares ABSA abilities. MVP (transfer) trained with simple tasks (TASD and ASTE here) with adequate data can be easily transferred to tough tasks (ASQP and ACOS here) when the dataset sizes are small, and vice versa.\\nTable 4: Ablation of constrained decoding and effect of aggregation strategy on ASTE (L14) and ASQP (R15). \\u201cw\\/o cd\\u201d discards the constrained decoding during inference.

Moreover, we analyze different (b) CLS durations d,\\n(c) planning frequencies f, (d) PDMS horizons h, and (e) closed-loop background agent behaviors.\\n4.1\\nAlignment Between Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Evaluation\\nOpen-loop metrics should ideally be aligned with closed-loop metrics in their evaluation of different\\ndriving algorithms. In this section, we benchmark a large set of planners to analyze the alignment of\\nclosed-loop metrics with traditional distance-based open-loop metrics and the proposed PDMS.\\nBenchmark. Studying the relation of closed-loop and open-loop metrics necessitates access to a\\nfully reactive simulator. To stay compatible with the dataset, we use the nuPlan simulator [26], which\\nenables simulation for privileged planners with access to ground-truth perception and HD map inputs.\\nSimilar to PDMS, nuPlan combines weighted averages and multiplied penalties in two official scores:\\nthe open-loop score (OLS) aggregates displacement and heading errors with a multiplied miss-rate,\\nand the closed-loop score (CLS) implements similar metrics from Section 3. Including PDMS, all\\nmetrics are in [0, 1] with higher scores indicating better performance.\\nDue to the heavy computational requirements of closed-loop simulation, we evaluate on the navmini\\nsplit. This is a new split we create for rapid testing, with 396 scenarios in total that are independent of\\nboth navtrain and navtest but filtered using the same strategy (Section 3.1) and hence similarly\\ndistributed. We note that nuPlan offers two kinds of background agents: reactive agents along lane\\ncenters based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [48], and non-reactive agents replayed from the\\ndataset, which we employ unless otherwise stated. While reactive simulations of longer or dynamic\\nlengths are generally desirable, e.g. to evaluate long-term decisions, enabling this requires dedicated\\nsolutions to long-horizon simulation that are not currently available in nuPlan [13]. Therefore, we\\ndefault to a fixed closed-loop simulation duration of d = 15s, and a planning frequency of f = 10Hz,\\nwhich are the standard closed-loop simulation settings in nuPlan [26].\\nMotion Planners. Open-loop metrics favor learned planners while rule-based approaches perform\\nwell in closed-loop evaluation in nuPlan [16]. We use a combination of both planner types in this\\nexperiment to cover different performance levels. In total, we include 37 rule-based planners with 2\\nconstant velocity and 8 constant acceleration models, 15 IDM planners [48], and 12 PDM-Closed\\nvariants [16] which differ in hyperparameters for trajectory generation. For learned planning, we\\nevaluate Urban Driver models [42] of 2 model sizes and 2 training lengths, and PlanCNN [38] models\\nwith 15 input combinations of the BEV raster, ego status, centerline, and navigation goal. We train\\nall models on {25%, 50%, 100%} of navtrain and an equally sized uniformly sampled subset of\\nOpenScene, giving 114 learned planners.

We show the no at-fault collision (NC), drivable area compliance\\n(DAC), time-to-collision (TTC), comfort (Comf.), and ego progress (EP) subscores, and the PDM\\nScore (PDMS), as percentages. Relying on the ego status is insufficient for competitive results. While\\nsensor agents improve, the gap to human performance highlights our benchmark\\u2019s challenges.\\nproperties of both learned and rule-based planners, whereas distance-based open-loop metrics show\\na clear misalignment. Decreasing the CLS duration in (b) from d = 15s to d = 4s further raises\\nthe correlation of PDMS and OLS, as the simulation horizon more closely matches the open-loop\\ncounterparts. Interestingly, we observe a higher correlation of open-loop metrics in (c) when reducing\\nthe planning frequency to 2Hz. We expect a lower planning frequency to mitigate cumulative errors\\nand enhance the controller\\u2019s stability in simulation, leading to more precise trajectory execution.\\nMoreover, we observe an increase in correlation for longer PDMS horizons in (d), ranging from\\nh = 2s to h = 8s. While predicting the future motion over 8s is challenging in uncertain scenarios,\\nour results indicate the value of long horizons when evaluating motion planners. Lastly, replacing the\\nnon-reactive background agents with reactive IDM vehicles during closed-loop simulation in (e) has\\nlittle effect on the correlation, possibly due to the similar difficulty of both tasks [16].\\nThe imbalanced distribution of different types of planners in our study may introduce biases into\\nthe overall correlations presented in Fig. 3. To address this, we visualize the individual correlations\\nof each planner type in Fig. 4. The correlation values vary depending on metric range and variance\\nof each planner type. Nevertheless, when examining each type individually, the PDMS is better\\ncorrelated to the CLS than the OLS, and is always positively correlated.\\n4.2\\nAnalysis of the State of the Art in End-to-End Autonomous Driving\\nIn this section, we benchmark a collection of end-to-end architectures, which previously achieved\\nstate-of-the-art performance on existing open- or closed-loop benchmarks.\\nMethods. As a lower bound, we consider the (1) Constant Velocity baseline detailed in Section 3.1.\\nWe include an (2) Ego Status MLP as a second \\\"blind\\\" agent, which leverages an MLP for trajectory\\nprediction given only the ego velocity, acceleration and navigation goal. As an established architecture\\non CARLA, we evaluate our reimplementation of (3) TransFuser [12], which uses three cropped\\nand downscaled forward-facing cameras, concatenated into a 1024 \\u00d7 256 image, and a rasterized\\nBEV LiDAR input for predicting waypoints. It performs 3D object detection and BEV semantic\\nsegmentation as auxiliary tasks.

The default configuration, which obtains the best results, uses the\\nnavigation goal, velocity, and acceleration as ego status inputs. Its camera FOV is around 140\\u25e6and\\nLiDAR range is 32m to the front (F), back (B), left (L), and right (R). It uses both auxiliary tasks.\\nthe same architecture as TransFuser but replaces the LiDAR input with a learned embedding, hence\\nrequiring only camera inputs. Moreover, we provide two state-of-the-art end-to-end architectures\\nfor open-loop trajectory prediction on nuScenes. (5) UniAD [21] incorporates a wide range of tasks,\\nsuch as mapping, tracking, motion, and occupancy prediction in a semi-sequential architecture, which\\nprocesses feature representations through several transformer decoders culminating in a trajectory\\nplanning module. (6) PARA-Drive [50] uses the same auxiliary tasks, but parallelizes the network\\narchitecture, such that the auxiliary task heads are trained in parallel with a shared encoder. Both\\nUniAD and PARA-Drive use a BEVFormer backbone [31], which encodes the eight surround-\\nview 1920 \\u00d7 1080 camera images over four temporal frames into a BEV feature representation.\\nImplementation details for all methods are provided in the supplementary material.\\nResults. We show our results on navtest in Table 1. The Constant Velocity model is a lower\\nbound, as the agent is used to identify trivial driving scenes excluded from the benchmark. The Ego\\nStatus MLP achieves a PDMS of 65.6, showing the value of the acceleration and navigation goal for\\navoiding collisions and driving off-road. However, we observe a clear gap between agents relying\\nsolely on the ego status and those considering sensor data, in contrast to results on nuScenes [32]. All\\nsensor agents achieve a PDMS of over 83, where TransFuser and PARA-Drive marginally perform\\nbest, with a PDMS of 84.0. Surprisingly, the camera-only LTF achieves similar results (83.8). UniAD\\nreaches a PDMS of 83.4, which, together with PARA-Drive, do not surpass the performance of\\nTransFuser and LTF, despite the need for more demanding training, e.g., 80 GPUs for 3 days to train\\nPARA-Drive versus 1 GPU for 1 day for TransFuser on the navtrain split. Due to the definition\\nof at-fault collisions, which discard certain rear-collisions into the ego vehicle, we suspect that\\nsurround-view cameras used by UniAD and PARA-Drive, and LiDAR input of TransFuser, are less\\nimportant than the wide-angle front camera which is the only input of LTF. The 10 PDMS discrepancy\\nto the human operator demonstrates that navtest poses challenges even to well-studied end-to-end\\narchitectures. Specifically, the drivable area compliance (DAC) and ego progress (EP) subscores\\nremain the most challenging. Notably, EP cannot be solved purely by human imitation, given that the\\nmaximum progress estimate used for normalization is based on a privileged rule-based motion planner.\\nInterestingly, all agents achieve near-perfect comfort scores, indicating that smooth acceleration and\\njerk profiles are learned naturally from human imitation.\\nAnalyzing TransFuser. In Table 2, we compare several training settings for TransFuser. For\\nthe three training seeds in configs A1-A3, we observe a standard deviation of \\u00b1 0.56 in PDMS,\\nwhich is relatively small compared to variance among training seeds for closed-loop simulations in\\nCARLA [17]. Further, unlike CARLA, NAVSIM is deterministic, and we obtain identical scores\\nwhen repeating evaluations of a deterministic driving agent. Discarding velocity and acceleration\\n(B1) lowers PDMS by 1.5 \\u22122.6, whereas only removing the acceleration (B2) lowers the score by\\n1.0 \\u22122.1. We conclude that while TransFuser benefits from the ego status, it is not purely relying\\non the kinematic state for planning. Next, only considering the front camera (C1) with a 60\\u25e6FOV\\nleads to a small drop in almost all subscores, compared to our default setting of three cropped and\\n8\\nconcatenated images with a FOV of 140\\u25e6. However, expanding the FOV with additional cameras\\ndoes not result in substantially improved scores. Interestingly, restricting the LiDAR range to 16m\\nin all directions (D1), results in a score of 79, which is lower than dropping LiDAR altogether (see\\nLTF in Table 1). Expanding the LiDAR range to 64m in the forward direction (D2) or all directions\\n(D3) does not provide significant improvements. We suspect that changes in the LiDAR range overly\\nsimplify or complicate the auxiliary 3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation tasks, which\\noperate in the LiDAR coordinate frame, hindering effective imitation learning. We check the impact\\nof the auxiliary tasks by excluding them, where performance drops without BEV Segmentation (E1).\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nPDM Score\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n#Teams\\nConstant Velocity\\nTransFuser\\nFigure 5: NAVSIM Challenge.\\nCVPR 2024 NAVSIM Challenge.
