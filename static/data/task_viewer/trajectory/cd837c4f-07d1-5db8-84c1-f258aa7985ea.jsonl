{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, discus-\\nsions on sensitive issues can become toxic\\neven if the users are well-intentioned.\\nFor\\nsafer models in such scenarios, we present\\nthe Sensitive Questions and Acceptable Re-\\nsponse (SQUARE) dataset, a large-scale Ko-\\nrean dataset of 49k sensitive questions with\\n42k acceptable and 46k non-acceptable re-\\nsponses. The dataset was constructed lever-\\naging HyperCLOVA in a human-in-the-loop\\nmanner based on real news headlines.

As initial\\nsteps to cope with such risks, recent works mainly\\ntarget scenarios in which LLMs interact with ill-\\nintentioned users: those who explicitly make offen-\\nsive remarks (Xu et al., 2021; Lees et al., 2022), and\\nthose who make adversarial attacks to elicit harm-\\nful responses (Wallace et al., 2019; Perez et al.,\\n2022; Ganguli et al., 2022), for instance.\\n\\u22c6Authors equally contributed.\\n\\u266fThis work was done during their internship at NAVER\\nAI Lab.\\nEmail to: {hwaran.lee, jungwoo.ha}@navercorp.com,\\nseokhee.hong@vision.snu.ac.kr\\nHowever, interactions with well-intentioned\\nusers can also turn toxic if LLMs do not respond\\nto sensitive questions carefully. In particular, we\\nfocus our attention on three categories of sensitive\\nquestions commonly asked in response to real-life\\nevents: a question eliciting an opinion on a divi-\\nsive issue (e.g., Q1 in Table 1), a question elicit-\\ning an opinion on an issue where a clear ethical\\nnorm applies (e.g., Q3 in Table 1), and a question\\neliciting a prediction about the future (e.g., Q4 in\\nTable 1). Note these questions themselves are not\\nnecessarily toxic. However, carelessly responding\\nto them may cause unwanted harm, such as rein-\\nforcing stereotypes, motivating unethical responses\\nor behaviors, and disseminating misinformation,\\nrespectively. Unfortunately, however, interactions\\nwith well-intentioned users on sensitive issues have\\nbeen largely overlooked.\\nIn this paper, we present the Sensitive Questions\\nand Acceptable Responses (SQUARE) dataset,\\na large-scale Korean dataset of 49k sensitive\\nquestions with 42k acceptable and 46k non-\\nacceptable responses.1 To create realistic ques-\\ntions and responses, we fed real news headlines\\nfrom popular news media in South Korea to\\nHyperCLOVA (Kim et al., 2021) when generating\\nquestions and responses using demonstration-based\\nprompting (Gao et al., 2021). Then, following Liu\\net al. (2022); Swayamdipta et al. (2020), only am-\\nbiguous cases identified by a filter model were\\nmanually labeled by crowd-workers according to\\na taxonomy of sensitive questions and acceptable\\nresponses. Here, the filter model was incrementally\\nimproved by refinement through three human-in-\\nthe-loop iterations for increased reliability.\\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of the dataset,

This allows us to\\nfocus on contexts in which a response is expected\\nand plays a key role in controlling the direction\\nof the conversation. In particular, we target the\\nfollowing three categories of sensitive questions\\ncommonly asked in response to real-life events\\n(See Table 1 for examples): 3\\n\\u2022 A contentious question eliciting an opinion\\non a divisive issue. Responses committing to a\\nparticular stance may cause unwanted harms,\\nsuch as suppressing minority opinions or rein-\\nforcing biases toward certain social groups.\\n\\u2022 An ethical question eliciting an opinion on\\nan issue where a clear ethical norm applies.\\nResponses inconsistent with the ethical norm\\n2https:\\/\\/www.collinsdictionary.com\\/dictionary\\/\\nenglish\\/sensitive\\n3To categorize the types of sensitive questions, we first\\ncollaborated with experts in related areas such as social sci-\\nence and law, and then we also got feedback from two pilot\\nannotation tests.\\n6693\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"may cause unwanted harm, such as motivating\\nunethical behaviors.\\n\\u2022 A predictive question eliciting a prediction\\nabout the future.\\nResponses making or\\ngrounded in a prediction, which is often un-\\ncertain by nature, may cause unwanted harm,\\nsuch as spreading misinformation and causing\\nmaterial harms.\\nAcceptable Response.\\nWe consider acceptable\\nresponses to sensitive questions to be those that are\\n\\u201charmless, but non-evasive\\u201d (Bai et al., 2022b).\\n(Non-evasiveness is important, as boilerplates\\nlike \\u201cI cannot answer the question.\\u201d are less help-\\nful.) We consider six categories of acceptable re-\\nsponses, where the first three actively make a posi-\\ntive impact, and the remaining three avoid making\\na negative impact (See Table 1 for examples):\\n\\u2022 A response that is inclusive with social\\ngroups, i.e., it respects the diversity of social\\ngroups.\\n\\u2022 A response that is inclusive with opinions,\\ni.e., it respects the diversity of opinions.\\n\\u2022 A response that is ethically aware, i.e., it is\\nconsistent with the ethical norms.\\n\\u2022 A response that is nonpredictive, i.e., it does\\nnot make explicit nor implicit predictions\\nabout the future.\\n\\u2022 A response that is objective, i.e., it provides\\nobjective information without making subjec-\\ntive judgments on the issue at hand.\\n\\u2022 A response that is indirect, i.e., it avoids pro-\\nviding a definite answer to the question, with-\\nout being completely evasive.\\n2.2\\nTask Formulation\\nSQUARE supports several tasks in the context of\\nconversations surrounding sensitive issues. In this\\nwork, we focus our attention on identifying and\\ngenerating acceptable responses to sensitive ques-\\ntions:\\nAcceptable Response Classification.\\nThis task\\naims to identify acceptable responses to sensitive\\nquestions, which can be formulated as a binary\\nclassification task: Given a response r, the goal is\\nto output true if r is \\u201cacceptable,\\u201d as previously\\ndefined, and false, otherwise.\\nAcceptable Response Generation.\\nThis task\\naims to generate an acceptable response to a given\\nsensitive question: Given a sensitive question q, the\\ngoal is to generate a response r that is \\u201cacceptable,\\u201d\\nas previously defined.\\n3\\nThe SQUARE Dataset\\n3.1\\nOverview of Dataset Construction\\nOur dataset creation framework sequentially con-\\nsists of (1) question generation and (2) response\\ngeneration, as depicted in Figure 1.\\nFirst,\\nHyperCLOVA (Kim et al., 2021)4 is used to gener-\\nate subjective and sensitive questions, given news\\ntitles as input. HyperCLOVA is then again used\\nto generate both acceptable and non-acceptable re-\\nsponses to the questions.\\nIn each generation phase, we employ the\\ndemonstration-based prompting method (Gao et al.,\\n2021; Mishra et al., 2022). The prompt included\\nan instruction and a set of sample sentences, which\\nwere used to generate the HyperCLOVA-generated\\nsentences in the styles that match the demonstra-\\ntion samples. A trained filter model automatically\\nremove objective questions or select ambiguous\\nresponses for cost-efficient labeling. Finally, hu-\\nman annotators review and label the sentences. By\\nrepeating this process in a human-in-the-loop, we\\nimprove the filter models and efficiency of label-\\ning costs. The detailed generation processes are\\ndescribed in the following sections.\\n3.2\\nSensitive Question Generation\\n3.2.1\\nSensitive Issue Collection\\nTo generate the questions about common yet sensi-\\ntive, we crawled the Korean news titles from three\\nsources: Ranking news, The Blue House National\\nPetition, and Daily Top 10 Issues at BigKinds.\\nRanking news indicates the top-ranked news ar-\\nticles on the Naver News platform5, which tracks\\nthe most viewed news stories across all major Ko-\\nrean news outlets over six topical categories: pol-\\nitics, economy, society, life & culture, world, and\\ntech & science.
