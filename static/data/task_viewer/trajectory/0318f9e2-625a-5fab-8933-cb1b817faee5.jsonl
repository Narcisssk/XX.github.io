{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We\\ncompare our method against KV cache compression algorithms, including H2O (Zhang et al., 2023b),\\nTOVA (Oren et al., 2024), FastGen (Ge et al., 2024), and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023b).\\nImplementation Details\\nWe implement DuoAttention in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) using\\nRoPE (Su et al., 2021) and RMSNorm kernels from FlashInfer (Ye et al., 2024). For retrieval head\\nidentification, we use a batch size of 1, inserting ten 32-word passkeys into the BookSum (Kry\\u00b4\\nsci\\u00b4\\nnski\\net al., 2021) dataset. The identification process uses 128 sink tokens and 256 recent tokens. Training\\nsamples are drawn from 50 intervals ranging from 1,000 tokens to the model-specific maximum\\nlength. Passkeys are randomly inserted at 1000 points within the context. Further details are included\\nin Appendix Section A.1. We optimize gate values using the AdamW (Kingma & Ba, 2015) optimizer,\\nstarting with a learning rate of 0.02, warming up from 0.002 in the first 400 steps, and reducing back\\nto 0.002 in the final 400 steps. All experiments run for 2,000 steps on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\\n3.2\\nLONG-CONTEXT BENCHMARKS\\nWe evaluate DuoAttention using the Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark and LongBench (Bai\\net al., 2023). We use two long-context models: Llama-2-7B-32K-Instruct and Llama-3-8B-Instruct-\\nGradient-1048k. We configure DuoAttention with a 25% retrieval head ratio for Llama-2-7B-32K-\\nInstruct and a 50% ratio for Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k. We compare DuoAttention with\\nH2O, TOVA, and StreamingLLM using the same KV cache budget. We use 64 sink, 256 recent\\ntokens, and 32,000 pre-filling chunk size for DuoAttention. Since the original designs of H2O and\\nTOVA do not support long contexts, we modify their algorithms by replacing the pre-filling stage\\nwith FlashAttention and simulating decoding for the last 50 tokens of the input, following Tang et al.\\n(2024b). FastGen\\u2019s algorithm does not allow for the specification of the KV compression ratio, as it\\nfluctuates with inputs. Therefore, we adjust the attention recovery ratio to ensure the KV cache budget\\nis, on average, above 25% or 50% in the experiments shown in Figure 6. Additionally, FastGen\\u2019s\\nquadratic memory cost during the attention profiling phase limits its ability to handle long-context\\nsamples. We measure FastGen\\u2019s performance on NIAH for Llama-2-7B up to a 24K context and for\\nLlama-3-8B up to a 32K context; beyond these sizes, it results in out-of-memory errors. Detailed\\nbaseline implementations and justifications are provided in Appendix Section A.3 and Section A.5.\\nNeedle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) is a challenging pressure test designed to assess the ability of models\\nto accurate identify and retrieve relevant information from lengthy context. As shown in Figure 6,\\nall baseline methods fail to retrieve correct answers from the various depths of the long sequence,\\nas they discard the KV cache containing the necessary information during generation.

For DuoAttention, we\\nconfigure 32 sink tokens and 128 recent tokens on MMLU, and 16 sink tokens and 64 recent tokens\\non MBPP and MT-Bench. As shown in Figure 8 and Table 1, DuoAttention consistently outperforms\\nall baselines under the same KV cache budget across various models, including Llama-2-7B, Llama-\\n3-8B, and Llama-3-70B-Instruct. With a 50% KV cache budget, DuoAttention achieves near-lossless\\nperformance on most benchmarks, demonstrating that it preserves the model\\u2019s original capabilities.\\n8\\nDuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and Streaming Heads\\nMemory (GB)\\n0\\n20K\\n40K\\n60K\\n80K\\n100K 120K 140K 160K 180K 200K\\n0\\n100K 200K 300K 400K 500K 600K 700K 800K 900K\\n1M\\n0\\n60\\n120\\n20K\\n40K\\n60K\\n80K\\n100K 120K 140K 160K 180K 200K\\n39\\n36\\n34\\n31\\n29\\n26\\n24\\n22\\n19\\n17\\n110\\n100\\n91\\n81\\n71\\n61\\n52\\n42\\n32\\n22\\n0\\n70\\n140\\n100K 200K 300K 400K 500K 600K 700K 800K 900K\\n1M\\n76\\n70\\n64\\n58\\n52\\n46\\n40\\n34\\n27\\n21\\n137\\n125\\n112\\n100\\n88\\n76\\n64\\n52\\n39\\n27\\nContext Length\\nLate\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nO\\nO\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOO\\nO\\nO\\nO\\nMemory (GB)\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n10K\\n20K\\n30K\\n40K\\n50K\\n60K\\n70K\\n80K\\n90K\\n100K\\n19\\n17\\n15\\n14\\n14\\n14\\n13\\n12\\n11\\n11\\n19\\n19\\n18\\n19\\n19\\n18\\n19\\n19\\n19\\n19\\nFull Attention\\nDuoAttention\\n0\\n80\\n160\\n32K\\n64K\\n96K\\n128K 160K 192K 224K 256K 288K 320K\\n156\\n142\\n135\\n125\\n123\\n123\\n110\\n105\\n99\\n93\\n154\\n154\\n155\\n154\\n155\\n152\\n0\\n40\\n80\\n10K\\n20K\\n30K\\n40K\\n50K\\n60K\\n70K\\n80K\\n90K\\n100K\\n34\\n33\\n32\\n31\\n30\\n30\\n29\\n28\\n27\\n26\\n71\\n70\\n69\\n68\\n67\\n66\\n65\\n64\\n63\\n62\\n0\\n40\\n80\\n32K\\n64K\\n96K\\n128K 160K 192K 224K 256K 288K 320K\\n70\\n66\\n63\\n59\\n56\\n52\\n49\\n45\\n42\\n38\\n75\\n72\\n68\\n65\\n61\\n58\\nLlama-2-7B (MHA 25%) Pre-filling 100K Context\\nLlama-3-8B (GQA 50%) Pre-filling 320K Context\\nLatency (s)\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nOOM\\nPre-filling Chunk Size\\nFigure 10: Pre-filling latency and memory usage of DuoAttention compared to full attention across varying\\npre-filling chunk sizes.

We pre-allocate the KV cache for the entire benchmark\\nsequence to prevent the extra overheads of dynamic memory allocations. The default number format\\nfor weights and activations is BFloat16. By employing a retrieval head ratio of 25% for Llama-2-7B\\nand 50% for Llama-3-8B, DuoAttention maintains accuracy while significantly improving efficiency.\\nDecoding Efficiency\\nAs shown in Figure 9, DuoAttention\\u2019s decoding speed scales linearly, though\\nwith a flatter slope compared to full attention, reflecting the chosen retrieval head ratio. This efficient\\nscaling leads to significant reductions in memory usage and notable improvements in decoding speed.\\nThese improvements approach the inverse of the retrieval head ratios as context length increases.\\nFigure 11 shows DuoAttention\\u2019s speedup and memory savings across various KV budget settings for a\\nfixed context size. Both decoding latency and memory usage decrease linearly as the ratio of retrieval\\nheads is reduced in the deployment configuration. Under the settings in Figure 11, DuoAttention\\nachieves maximum improvements on an A100 GPU: 2.55\\u00d7 memory reduction for MHA and 1.67\\u00d7\\nfor GQA models, and 2.18\\u00d7 latency reduction for MHA and 1.50\\u00d7 for GQA models.\\nPre-filling Efficiency\\nDuoAttention also accelerates long-context pre-filling for LLMs, as discussed\\nin Section 2.3. Figure 10 shows that DuoAttention significantly reduces both pre-filling latency\\nand memory usage, with these savings increasing as the pre-filling chunk size decreases. This is\\nbecause the time and memory complexity for the streaming heads are reduced with smaller chunk\\nsizes. DuoAttention achieves up to 1.73\\u00d7 latency reduction for MHA and 1.63\\u00d7 for GQA models,\\nwith memory reductions of up to 2.38\\u00d7 for MHA and 1.53\\u00d7 for GQA models.\\n9\\nDuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and Streaming Heads\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n0.25\\n0.50\\n0.75\\n1.00\\nPasskey Retrieval\\nDifferent Retrieval\\nHead Identification Methods\\nAttention Profiling\\nOptimization\\nw\\/ Language Modeling\\nOptimization\\nw\\/ Synthetic Data (ours)\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\nDifferent Optimization\\nSink and Recent Sizes\\nSink, Recent = 0, 320\\nSink, Recent = 320, 0\\nSink, Recent = 64, 256\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\n0.60\\n0.65\\n0.70\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\nDifferent Deployment\\nSink and Recent Sizes\\nSink, Recent = 4, 16\\nSink, Recent = 16, 64\\nSink, Recent = 32, 128\\nSink, Recent = 64, 256\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\n0.45\\n0.50\\n0.55\\nMMLU\\nAttention Profiling\\nOptimization\\nw\\/ Language Modeling\\nOptimization\\nw\\/ Synthetic Data (ours)\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.580\\n0.585\\nSink, Recent = 0, 320\\nSink, Recent = 320, 0\\nSink, Recent = 64, 256\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n0.50\\n0.55\\nSink, Recent = 4, 16\\nSink, Recent = 16, 64\\nSink, Recent = 32, 128\\nSink, Recent = 64, 256\\nKV Cache Budget\\nFigure 13: Ablation studies: (1) Comparison of retrieval head identification methods, showing the superiority\\nof our optimization-based approach with synthetic data over attention profiling and language modeling.

Previous studies\\nhave shown that weight quantization (Xiao et al., 2023a; Lin et al., 2024) and 4-bit KV cache\\nquantization (Lin* et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Hooper et al., 2024) do not compromise model\\nperformance. We combine DuoAttention with the QServe (Lin* et al., 2024) quantization method\\nand kernels to enable 8-bit weight and 4-bit KV cache LLM inference. Measured results are shown\\nin Figure 12. Combining quantization techniques with DuoAttention allows us to accommodate up to\\n3.30 million tokens on a single A100-80G GPU using the Llama-3-8B model, resulting in a 6.4\\u00d7\\nincrease in capacity compared to the naive full attention BF16 deployment. ...\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
