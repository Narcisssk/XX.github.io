{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}
{"role": "user", "content": "[Question]: According to the paper that proposes the Subspace Identification Guarantee model, which method is used to estimate the label distribution from the target domain $p_{\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}}$?

Although current methods achieve target joint distribution identifiability by enforcing minimal changes across domains, they often necessitate stringent conditions, such as an adequate number of domains, monotonic transformation of latent variables, and invariant label distributions. These requirements are challenging to satisfy in real-world applications. To mitigate the need for these strict assumptions, we propose a subspace identification theory that guarantees the disentanglement of domain-invariant and domain-specific variables under less restrictive constraints regarding domain numbers and transformation properties, thereby facilitating domain adaptation by minimizing the impact of domain shifts on invariant variables. Based on this theory, we develop a Subspace Identification Guarantee (SIG) model that leverages variational inference. Furthermore, the SIG model incorporates class-aware conditional alignment to accommodate target shifts where label distributions change with the domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our SIG model outperforms existing MSDA techniques on various benchmark datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) is a method of transferring knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain, to address the challenge of domain shift between the training data and the test environment. Mathematically, in the context of MSDA, we assume the existence of $M$ source domains $\\\\{S_{1},S_{2},...,S_{M}\\\\}$ and a single target domain $\\\\tau$ . For each source domain $S_{i}$ , data are drawn from a distinct distribution, represented as $p_{\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{u}_{s_{i}}}$ , where the variables $\\\\mathbf{x}$ , y, $\\\\mathbf{u}$ correspond to features, labels, and domain indices, respectively. In a similar manner, the distribution within the target domain $\\\\tau$ is given by $p_{\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{u}_{T}}$ . In the source domains, we have access to $m_{i}$ annotated feature-label pairs of each domain, denoted Tby $(\\\\mathbf{x}^{S_{i}},\\\\mathbf{y}^{S_{i}})=(\\\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{S_{i}},y_{k}^{S_{i}})_{k=1}^{m_{i}}$ , while in the target domain, only $m\\\\tau$ unannotated features are observed, represented as $(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(\\\\mathcal{T})})=(\\\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{\\\\mathcal{T}})_{k=1}^{m_{\\\\mathcal{T}}}$ The primary goal of MSDA is to effectively leverage these labeled source data and unlabeled target data to identify the target joint distribution px,y|u .\\nHowever, identifying the target joint distribution of $\\\\mathbf{x}$ , ${\\\\bf y}|{\\\\bf u}_{\\\\mathcal{T}}$ using only $\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\mathbf{u}_{\\\\mathcal{T}}$ as observations present a significant challenge, since the possible mappings from $p_{\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{u}_{T}}$ to $p_{\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\mathbf{u}_{T}}$ are infinite when no extra constraints are given. To solve this problem, some assumptions have been proposed to constrain the domain shift, such as covariate shift [44], target shift [58, 1], and conditional shift [3, 56]. For example, the most conventional covariate shift assumption posits that $p_{\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{x}}$ is fixed across different domains while $p_{\\\\mathbf{x}}$ varies. Under this assumption, researchers can employ techniques such as importance reweighting [52], invariant representation learning [11], or cycle consistency [17] for distribution alignment. Additionally, target shift assumes that $p_{\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\mathbf{y}}$ is fixed while the label distribution $p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}$ changes, whereas conditional shift is represented by a fixed $p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}$ and a varying $p_{\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\mathbf{y}}$ . More generally, the minimal change principle has been proposed, which not only unifies the aforementioned assumptions but also enables the theoretical guarantee of the identifiability of the target joint distribution. Specifically, it assumes that $p_{\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{u}}$ and $p_{\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\mathbf{y},\\\\mathbf{u}}$ change independently and the change of $p_{\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\mathbf{y},\\\\mathbf{u}}$ is minimal. Please refer to Appendix G for further discussion of related works, including domain adaptation and identification.\\n\\nAlthough current methods demonstrate the identifiability of the target joint distribution through the minimal change principle, they often impose strict conditions on the data generation process and the number of domains, limiting their practical applicability. For instance, iMSDA [30] presents the component-wise identification of the domain-changed latent variables, subsequently identifying target joint distribution by modeling a data generation process with variational inference. However, this identification requires the following conditions. First, a sufficient number of auxiliary variables is employed for the component-wise theoretical guarantees, meaning that when the dimension of latent variables is $n$ , a total of $2n+1$ domains are needed. Second, in order to identify high-level invariant latent variables, a component-wise monotonic function between latent variables must be assumed. Third, these methods implicitly assume that label distribution remains stable across domains, despite the prevalence of target shift in real-world scenarios. These conditions are often too restrictive to be met in practice, highlighting the need for a more general approach to identifying latent variables across a wider range of domain shifts.\\nIn an effort to alleviate the need for such strict assumptions, we present a subspace identification theory in this paper that guarantees the disentanglement of domain-invariant and domain-specific variables under more relaxed constraints concerning the number of domains and transformation properties. In contrast to component-wise identification, our subspace identification method demands fewer auxiliary variables (i.e., when the dimension of latent variables is $n$ , only $n+1$ domains are required). Additionally, we design a more general data generation process that accounts for target shift and does not necessitate monotonic transformation between latent variables. In this process, we categorize latent variables into four groups based on whether they are influenced by domain index or label. Building on the theory and causal generation process, we develop a Subspace Identification Guarantee (SIG) model that employs variational inference to identify latent variables. A class-aware condition alignment is incorporated to mitigate the impact of target shift, ensuring the update of the most confident cluster embedding. Our approach is validated through a simulation experiment for subspace identification evaluation and four widely-used public domain adaptation benchmarks for application evaluation. The impressive performance that outperforms state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We begin with introducing the data generation process. As shown in Figure 1, the observed data ${\\\\pmb x}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}$ are generated by latent variables $\\\\mathbf{z}\\\\in{\\\\mathcal{Z}}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ . Sequentially, we divide the latent variables $\\\\mathbf{z}$ into the four parts, i.e. $\\\\mathbf{z}=\\\\{\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\mathbf{z}_{2},\\\\mathbf{z}_{3},\\\\mathbf{z}_{4}\\\\}\\\\in$ $\\\\mathcal{Z}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ , which are shown as follows.\\n\\u2022 domain-specific and label-irrelevant variables $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}$ .   \\n\\u2022 domain-specific but label-relevant variables $\\\\mathbf{z}_{2}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}$ .   \\n\\u2022 domain-invariant and label-relevant variables $\\\\mathbf{z}_{3}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{3}}$ .   \\n\\u2022 domain-invariant but label-irrelevant variables $\\\\mathbf{z}_{4}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{4}}$ .\\nTo better understand these latent variables, we provide some examples in DomainNet datasets. First, $\\\\mathbf{z}_{1}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{1}}$ denotes the styles of the images like \\u201cinfograph\\u201d and \\u201csketch\\u201d, which are irrelevant to labels. $\\\\mathbf{z}_{2}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{2}}$ denotes the latent variables that can be the texture information relevant to domains and labels.\\nFor example, the samples of \\u201cclock\\u201d and \\u201ctelephone\\u201d contain some digits, and these digits in these samples are a special texture, which can be used for classification and be influenced by differen styles, such as \\u201cinfograph\\u201d. $\\\\mathbf{z}_{3}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{3}}$ denotes the latent variables that are only relevant to the labels. For example, in the DomainNet dataset, it can be interpreted as the meaning of different classes like \\u201cBicycle\\u201d or \\u201cTeapot\\u201d. Finally, $\\\\mathbf{z}_{4}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n_{4}}$ denotes the label-irrelevant latent variables. For example, $\\\\mathbf{z}_{4}$ can be interpreted as the background that is invariant to domains and labels.\\n\\nBased on the definitions of these latent variables, we let the observed data be generated from $\\\\mathbf{z}$ through an invertible and smooth mixing function $g:\\\\mathcal{Z}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{X}$ . Due to the target shift, we further consider that the $p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}$ is influenced by $\\\\mathbf{u}$ , i.e. $\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{y}$ .\\nCompared with the existing data generation process like [30], the proposed data generation process is different in three folds. First, $p_{\\\\mathbf{u}}$ is independent of $p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}$ in the iMSDA [30], so the target shift is not taken into account. Second, the data generation process of iMSDA requires an invertible and monotonic function between latent variables for component-wise identification, which is too strict to be met in practice. Third, to provide a more general way to depict the real-world data, our data generation process introduces the domain-specific but label-relevant latent variables $\\\\mathbf{z}_{s_{2}}$ and the domain-invariant but label-irrelevant variables $\\\\mathbf{z}_{4}$ .\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"In this part, we show how to identify the target joint distribution $p_{\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}|\\\\mathbf{u}_{T}}$ with the help of marginal distribution.

First, we need to model $\\\\begin{array}{r}{p_{\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\\\mathbf{z}_{2},\\\\mathbf{z}_{3},\\\\mathbf{z}_{4}}}\\\\end{array}$ , implying that we need to model the conditional distribution of observed data give latent variables, which coincides with a generative model for observed data.
