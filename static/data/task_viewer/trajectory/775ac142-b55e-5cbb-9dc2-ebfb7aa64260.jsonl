{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Model explanations have been indispensable for trust and interpretability in natural language processing (NLP) (Ribeiro et al., 2016, 2020; Lipton, 2018; Chen et al., 2020, 2021a). Free-text rationales, which explain a model prediction in natural language, have been especially appealing due to their fexibility in eliciting the reasoning process behind the model\\u2019s decision making (Camburu et al.,\\n2018; Narang et al., 2020; Rajani et al., 2019; Kumar and Talukdar, 2020; Brahman et al., 2021), making them closer to human explanations. However, existing metrics for free-text rationale evaluation remain narrowly focused on the extent to which a rationale can help a (proxy) model predict the label it explains (i.e., accuracy based) (Hase et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2021). These metrics offer little understanding of the new information contained in the rationale, as added to the original input, that could explain why the label is selected\\u2014 the very purpose a rationale is designed to serve. For instance, the two rationales $r_{1}^{*}$ and $\\\\hat{r}_{1,a}$ in Fig. 1 would be considered equally valuable under existing metrics, even though they supply different amount of novel and relevant information.\\nIn this paper, we overcome this shortcoming by introducing an automatic evaluation for free-text rationales along two dimensions: (1) whether the rationale supports (i.e., is predictive of) the intended label, and (2) how much new information does it provide to justify the label, beyond what is contained in the input. For example, rationale $\\\\hat{r}_{1,b}$ in Fig. 1 violates (1) because it is not predictive of the label, \\u201cenjoy nature\\u201d. Rationale $\\\\hat{r}_{1,a}$ does support the label but contains no new information that justifes it, beyond what is stated in the input $x$ ; thus, it violates (2). Rationale $r_{1}^{*}$ is satisfed along both dimensions: it supports the label and does so by providing new and relevant information, beyond what is in the input. Our proposed evaluation is designed to penalize both $\\\\hat{r}_{1,a}$ and $\\\\hat{r}_{1,b}$ , while rewarding rationales like $r_{1}^{*}$ .\\nWe introduce $\\\\mathrm{REV}^{2}$ , which adapts an information-theoretic framework from $\\\\mathrm{Xu}$ et al. (2020) for evaluating free-text rationales along the two dimensions mentioned above. Specifically, REV is based on conditional $\\\\nu$ -information (Hewitt et al., 2021), which quantifes the degree of information contained in a representation beyond another (baseline) representation, accessible to a model family $\\\\nu$ . As our baseline representation, we consider any vacuous rationale which simply (and declaratively) combines an input with a given label, without providing any new information relevant to answering why the label was chosen. REV adapts conditional $\\\\nu$ -information to evaluate rationales, where we compare two representations\\u2014one from an evaluation model trained to produce the label given the input and the rationale, and the other from another evaluation model for the same task but considering only the input (disguised as a vacuous rationale). Other metrics do not take into consideration vacuous rationales, and are hence unable to measure new and label-relevant information in rationales.\\n\\nIn our experiments, we present evaluations with REV for rationales under two reasoning tasks, commonsense question-answering (CQA; Talmor et al., 2019) and natural language inference (NLI; Bowman et al., 2015), across four benchmarks. Several quantitative evaluations demonstrate the capabilities of REV in providing evaluations along new dimensions for free-text rationales, while also being more consistent with human judgements compared to existing metrics. We also provide comparisons to demonstrate the sensitivity of REV to various degrees of input perturbations. Additionally, evaluation with REV offers insights into why rationales obtained through chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) do not necessarily improve prediction performance.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Model rationales broadly fall into two categories: extractive rationales and free-text rationales. Extractive rationales contain some important features extracted from input texts that make models produce fnal predictions (Lei et al., 2016; DeYoung et al., 2020; Jain et al., 2020; Schulz et al., 2020). Free-text rationales are produced by generative models in the form of natural language. Compared to extractive rationales, free-text rationales explain model predictions in a more human-like way and fll the gap in explaining reasoning tasks (Camburu et al., 2018; Narang et al., 2020; Rajani et al., 2019; Kumar and Talukdar, 2020; Brahman et al., 2021).\\nEvaluations on extractive rationales have been well studied, generally from two perspectives \\u2014 faithfulness and plausibility (DeYoung et al., 2020; Pruthi et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2022b). Faithfulness measures to which extent rationales refect the true reasoning process of models, while plausibility evaluates how convincing rationales are to humans (Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020). Other perspectives include the ability of rationales in helping a student model simulate a teacher model (Pruthi et al., 2022) or bridging the communication between a classifer and a layperson (Treviso and Martins, 2020). Existing automatic metrics for free-text rationales focus on rationale-label association, and measure the utility of a rationale based on how much it helps a model proxy predict the given label (inspired by human simulatability (Doshi-Velez and Kim, 2017)) (Hase et al., 2020) or the gold label (Wiegreffe et al., 2021) given the input. Chan et al. (2022a) further propose a framework to evaluate the automatic metrics. However, none of them consider measuring the amount of additional new information in free-text rationales. Sun et al. (2022) conduct a human study on the additional knowledge provided by free-text rationales. This work is the frst that proposes an automatic metric to quantify the new information in free-text rationales.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"6 Conclusion\",\"section_content\":\"We introduce REV, an information-theoretic measure to evaluate the amount of new, label-relevant information in free-text rationales, beyond the information contained in the input. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of REV compared to existing metrics focusing simply on label-rationale association, and show that REV is more consistent with human judgments. REV also offers insights into evaluating rationales generated via few-shot prompting. While we recommend the usage of REV alongside traditional performance metrics, future work might explore a combined metric to measure the correctness of a prediction as well as the informativeness of the rationale towards this prediction. Ultimately, free-text rationales are for the beneft of human users and there exist multiple criteria for human utility of rationales (Joshi et al., 2023), beyond label relevance and informativeness.\"}\n\nIn total, 3 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
