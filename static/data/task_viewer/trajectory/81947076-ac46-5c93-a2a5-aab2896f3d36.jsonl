{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Data coming from different sensors often capture information related to common latent factors. For example, many animals have two eyes that capture different but highly-correlated views of the same objects in the scene. Similarly, sensors of different modalities, such as eyes and ears, capture correlated information about the underlying scene, as do videos and other time series, where the sensors are separated in time rather than in modality. Learning how information of one sensor maps to information of another provides a self-supervised signal to disentangle the variability that is intrinsic in a sensor from the latent causes (e.g., objects) that are shared between multiple sensors. Indeed, there is evidence that infants spend a long time during development purposefully experiencing objects through different senses at the same time [1].\\nMotivated by this, we propose to learn meaningful representations of multi-view data by quantifying and exploiting such structure in a self-supervised fashion by using an information theoretic notion of common information as the guiding signal to disentangle common shared information present in high dimensional sensory data (Fig. 1).\\nHowever, defining a notion of common information is itself not trivial. The most natural and typical way to quantify the \\u201ccommon part\\u201d between random variables would be by quantifying their mutual information. But mutual information has no clear interpretation in terms of a decomposition of random variables in unique and common components. In particular, [2] note that there is generally no way to write two variables $X$ and $Y$ using a three part code $(A,B,C)$ such that $X={\\\\dot{f}}(A,C)$ , $Y=g(B,C)$ and where $C$ encodes all and only the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ . Discovering the largest common factor $C$ , which encodes what is known as the G\\u00e1cs-K\\u00f6rner common information, from high dimensional data is then a distinct problem on its own [3, 4].\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are currently no approaches to compute or approximate the G\\u00e1cs-K\\u00f6rner common information from high-dimensional samples [4]. In this work, we seek to learn common representations that satisfy the constraint that they are (approximately) a function of each input. A contribution in this paper is that we generalize the constraint that the representation needs to be a deterministic function and allow it to be a stochastic map. As we later show, this is helpful for quantifying and interpreting the latent representation, and allows us to parameterize the optimization with deep neural networks.\\nWe show that our objective can be optimized using a multi-view Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). Since in general each view can contain individual factors of variation that are not shared between the views, we augment our model with a set of unique latent variables that can capture unexplained latent factors of variation, and show that the common and unique component can be efficiently inferred from data through standard training. While training the multi-view VAE, we simultaneously develop a scalable approximation for the G\\u00e1cs-K\\u00f6rner common information, as we describe in Section 3.\\nTo empirically evaluate the ability to separate the common and unique latent factors we introduce two new datasets, which extend commonly used datasets for evaluating disentangled representations learning: dSprites [5] and 3dShapes [6]. For each dataset, we generate a set of paired views $(x_{1},x_{2})$ such that they share a set of common factors. This allows us to quantitatively evaluate the ability to separate the common and unique factors. We also compare our method to multi-view contrastive learning [7] and show that thanks to our definition we avoid learning degenerate representations when the views share little information.\\nWe hypothesize that a key reason precluding the identification of latent generating factors from observed data is that receiving a single sample of a scene is quite limiting. Indeed, classical neuroscience experiments has shown that the ability to interact with an environment, as opposed to passively observing sensory inputs, is critical for learning meaningful representations of the environment [8].\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
