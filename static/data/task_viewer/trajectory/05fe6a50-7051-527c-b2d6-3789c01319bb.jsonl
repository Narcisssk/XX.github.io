{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Our proposed framework can be applied to most, if not all, event extraction models. We select OneIE (Lin et al., 2020) and AMR-IE (Zhang and Ji, 2021) as base models given their state-of-theart performance on the event extraction task and publicly available source code. Next, we briefy describe the common architectures in the two models and refer readers to the original papers for more details. OneIE and AMR-IE perform event extraction in four8 steps. First, a language model encoder (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) computes the contextual representations W for an input sentence $W$ . Second, two identifcation layers take in the contextual representations W. One identifes the spans of event triggers and the other identifes the spans of arguments (i.e., entities). Both of them are based on a linear classifcation layer followed by a CRF layer (Lafferty et al., 2001) to capture the dependencies between predicted tags. They are optimized by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the gold-standard tag path, which is denoted as $\\\\mathbf{L}^{\\\\mathrm{Tri\\\\_I}}$ and $\\\\mathbf{L}^{\\\\mathrm{Arg\\\\_I}}$ for trigger and argument identifcation, respectively. Third, for each trigger or argument candidate, we compute its representation by averaging the token representations within the whole identifed span. Each trigger representation is fed into a classifcation layer to predict its type by minimizing the cross-entropy classifcation loss LTri_C. Each pair of trigger and argument representations are concatenated and fed into another classifcation layer to predict the argument role, which is also optimized by the cross-entropy loss $\\\\mathbf{L}^{\\\\mathrm{Arg\\\\_C}}$ . Finally, both OneIE and AMR-IE learn an additional global feature vector to capture the interactions across sub-tasks (e.g., a $L O C$ entity is impossible to be the Attacker of an Attack event)\\n\\nand instances (e.g., the Defendant of a Sentence event can also be an Agent of a Die event). During training, a global feature score is computed for the predicted information graph and the gold annotation, respectively, from their global feature vectors. The training objective is to minimize the gap between these two global feature scores, denoted as $\\\\mathbf{L}^{G}$ . Thus, the overall loss for the base event extraction model is:\\nAs the frst stage of our STF framework, we optimize the base event extraction model on labeled event mentions $\\\\scriptstyle{\\\\mathcal{X}}_{L}$ based on $\\\\mathbf{L}^{\\\\mathrm{E}}$ and the trained model will later be used to predict new event mentions for self-training.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"At the second stage of STF, we aim to further improve the event extraction model by taking the event mentions predicted from an external unlabeled corpus $\\\\mathcal{X}_{u}$ as pseudo samples for selftraining. To avoid the noise contained in the pseudo samples, we propose a scoring model that can evaluate the correctness of each event prediction. Our scoring model takes AMR graph as a reference motivated by the observation that an event structure usually shares similar semantics and network topology as the AMR graph of the same sentence, thus their compatibility can be used to measure the correctness of each event structure. This observation has also been discussed and shown effective in previous studies (Rao et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018; Zhang and Ji, 2021). However, previous studies directly take AMR graphs as input to the extraction model and thus require AMR graphs during both training and inference, making their performance highly dependent on the quality of AMR parsing. Different from them, our proposed STF only takes AMR graphs during reference to measure the correctness of event predictions during self-training, making it free from the potential errors propagation from AMR parsing during inference.\\n\\nGiven a sentence $\\\\tilde{W}\\\\in\\\\mathcal X_{u}$ from the unlabeled corpus and a predicted trigger ${\\\\tilde{\\\\tau}}_{i}$ and its argument $\\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}_{j}$ from $\\\\Tilde{W}$ , we aim to estimate a correctness score for each pair of the trigger and argument prediction based on its compatibility with their path in the AMR graph9. Thus, we frst apply the state-of-theart AMR parsing tool (Astudillo et al., 2020) to generate an AMR graph for $\\\\Tilde{W}$ : $G=(V,E)$ , $E=$ $\\\\{(v_{i},e_{i j},v_{j})|e_{i j}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{R})\\\\}$ . We follow (Huang et al., 2016; Zhang and Ji, 2021) and group the original set of AMR relations into 19 categories10, thus $e_{i j}$ denotes a particular relation category and $\\\\mathcal{R}$ denotes the set of AMR relation categories. Then, we identify the $v_{i},\\\\,v_{j}$ from AMR graph $G$ as the corresponding node of $\\\\tilde{\\\\tau}_{i},\\\\,\\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}_{j}$ , by node alignment following Zhang and Ji (2021). Then, we utilize the Breadth First Search to fnd the shortest path pi,j that connects and includes, $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ in $G$ . If there is no path between $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ , we add a new edge to connect them and assign other as the relation.\\nGiven a predicted trigger $\\\\Tilde{\\\\tau}_{i}$ and its type $\\\\tilde{l}_{\\\\tau_{i}}$ , a predicted argument $\\\\tilde{\\\\varepsilon}_{j}$ and its argument role $\\\\tilde{\\\\alpha}_{i j}$ , the scoring model estimates their correctness by taking $[\\\\tilde{l}_{\\\\tau_{i}},\\\\,p_{i j},\\\\,\\\\tilde{\\\\alpha}_{i j}]$ as input and outputs a compatibility score. As Figure 1 shows, it consists of a language model encoder (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) to encode the sentence $\\\\Tilde{W}$ and obtain the contextual representations for the tokens11, which are then used to initialize the representation of each node in $p_{i j}$ based on the alignment between the input tokens and the nodes in AMR graph following Zhang and Ji (2021). We draw edge representations from the AMR relation embedding matrix ${\\\\bf E}^{r e l}$ and combine them with node representations to form $\\\\mathbf{H}_{p_{i j}}$ , a representation for path $p_{i j}$ . We also get an event type representation $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau_{i}}$ for $\\\\tilde{l}_{\\\\tau_{i}}$ from the event-type embedding matrix $\\\\mathbf{E}^{t r i}$ and an argument role representation $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\alpha_{i j}}$ for $\\\\tilde{\\\\alpha}_{i j}$ from the argument role embedding matrix $\\\\mathbf{E}^{a r g}$ . Here, ${\\\\bf E}^{r e l},~{\\\\bf E}^{t r i}$ , and $\\\\mathbf{E}^{a r g}$ are all randomly initialized and will be optimized during training. Finally, we obtain the initial representations ${\\\\bf H}_{i j}^{i n i t}\\\\,=\\\\,[{\\\\bf h}_{\\\\tau_{i}},{\\\\bf H}_{p_{i j}},{\\\\bf h}_{\\\\alpha_{i j}}]$ for the sequence $[\\\\tilde{l}_{\\\\tau_{i}},p_{i j},\\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\alpha}}_{i j}]$ .\\n\\nTo estimate the compatibility between the event trigger and argument prediction and their path in the AMR graph, we apply multi-layer selfattention (Vaswani et al., 2017) over the joint representation of the AMR path and the event prediction $\\\\mathbf{H}_{i j}^{i n i t}$ to learn better contextual representations for the sequence $[\\\\tilde{l}_{\\\\tau_{i}},p_{i j},\\\\tilde{\\\\alpha}_{i j}]$ and we add the position embedding ${\\\\bf E}^{p o s}$ to $\\\\mathbf{H}_{i j}^{i n i t}$ before feed it into the self-attention layers:\\nwhere $M$ denotes the number of attention layers.\\nFinally, we compute an overall vector representation H\\u02c6 final f rom Hifjinal via average-pooling and feed it into a linear-layer and a Sigmoid function to compute a probability $c_{i j}$ , indicating the correctness of the predicted event trigger and argument. We optimize the scoring model based on the binary cross-entropy objective:\\nwhere $y_{i j}\\\\;\\\\;\\\\in\\\\;\\\\;(0,1)$ is a binary label that indicates the argument role is correct $(y_{i j}~=~1)$ or not $(y_{i j}\\\\;=\\\\;0)^{12}$ , and $\\\\psi$ is the parameters of the scoring model. During training, we have gold triggers and arguments as positive training instances and we swap the argument roles in positive training instances with randomly sampled incorrect labels to create negative training instances. After training the scoring model, we will fx its parameters and apply it to self-training.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We frst evaluate the performance of the scoring model by measuring how well it distinguishes the correct and incorrect argument role predictions from an event extraction model. Specifcally, we compute event predictions by running a fully trained event extraction model (i.e., OneIE or AMR-IE) on the validation and test sets of the three benchmark datasets. Based on the gold event annotations, we create a gold binary label (correct or incorrect) for each argument role prediction to indicate its correctness. For each event prediction, we pass it along with the corresponding AMR graph of the source sentence into the scoring model. If the correctness16 predicted by the scoring model agrees with the gold binary label, we treat it as a true prediction for scoring model, otherwise, a false prediction.\\nTo examine the impact of leveraging AMR in scoring model performance, we develop a baseline scoring model that shares the same structure with our proposed scoring model except that it does not take an AMR graph as an input. Specifcally, the baseline scoring model just takes the event mention (triggers, arguments and argument labels) in order to measure the compatibility score. The baseline scoring model is essentially an ablation of our scoring model where the AMR path is absent. As shown in Table 2, the performance of our scoring model outperforms the baseline scoring model by 1.4-1.7 F-score on the test sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graph in characterizing the correctness of each event prediction.\\nIn Table 1, we can observe that the semantics and structure of AMR paths can be easily mapped to argument role types. Sometimes, the even triggers are far from their arguments in plain text, but the AMR paths between them is short and informative. Another observation is that the scoring model tends to assign positive scores to argument roles that are more compatible with the AMR paths, although sometimes the scores for the gold argument roles are not the highest.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The data scarcity problem not only appears in the training data of ACE-05, ACE- $.05+$ and ERE-EN but appears in the development set. For example, in ACE-05, the development set only contains only 603 labeled argument roles for 22 argument role classes and 7 argument role classes have lees than 10 instances. To alleviate this problem, we propose to leverage part of the large-scale unlabeled dataset as a held-out development set. At the end of each epoch, instead of evaluating the event extraction model on the development set, we run the event extraction model on the unlabeled held-out development set to make event predictions and run the scoring model on the event predictions to compute compatibility scores. We utilize the averaged compatibility scores computed on all instances in the unlabeled held-out development datasets as the model selection criteria. We argue this is another application of the scoring model since its goal is to evaluate the correctness of event predictions. The size of the unlabeled held-out development set is 2,000.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Bio-xLSTM: Longe-Range Modeling of Biological and Chemical Sequences\\nBio-xLSTM introduces three xLSTM-based architectural variants tailored specifically to DNA\\n(Section 3.4), proteins (Section 3.5) and small molecules (Section 3.6). For these application domains,\\nwe extend xLSTM from causal language modeling (CLM) (Section 3.1) to new modeling approaches\\nsuch as fill-in the middle (FIM) , in-context learning (ICL) and masked language modeling (MLM)\\n(Section 3.2).\\n3.1\\nCausal Language Modeling and Next-Token Prediction\\nCausal language modeling (CLM) uses the\\nCLM loss: LCLM = EX\\u223cpX Et\\u223c[[1,T \\u22121]] CE (xt+1, xLSTM(X1:t)t) ,\\n(1)\\nwhere CE is the cross-entropy loss (with logits), pX is the data distribution, and [[1, T \\u22121]] is the\\ndiscrete uniform distribution from 1 to T \\u22121. The objective measures how well a particular sequence\\ntoken xt+1 can be predicted based on the previous tokens X1:t by the model xLSTM : RD\\u00d7t 7\\u2192\\nRD\\u00d7t. Therefore, this type of modeling is sometimes also called next token prediction (NTP),\\nuni-directional modeling or autoregressive (AR) modeling and the loss is also called NTP loss.\\nFill-in the middle (FIM) (Bavarian et al., 2022) is a modeling paradigm that integrates aspects of\\nboth CLM and MLM. In this approach, parts of the sequence are replaced with mask tokens, which\\nare then appended to the end of the sequence. This allows the model to utilize the entire context to\\npredict the masked tokens while maintaining an AR training framework. This strategy, allows the\\nmodel to perform both a) generative modeling and b) inpainting with CLM.\\nIn-context learning (ICL) is a capability of language models to learn and perform tasks by leveraging\\nadditional information provided as the contextual input without updating their parameters (Brown\\net al., 2020; Min et al., 2022). This approach allows models to learn from analogy, drawing insights\\nfrom patterns in the context to adapt their behavior. When the contextual input sequence is denoted as\\nZ \\u2208RD\\u00d7S and the conventional input sequence is denoted as X \\u2208RD\\u00d7T , then with an ICL model,\\nwe obtain Y \\u2032 = xLSTM([Z, X])(S+1):(S+T ), where [Z, X] indicates concatenation of contextual\\nand conventional inputs, and, the subscript (S + 1) : (S + T) indicates that the last output tokens\\n(those corresponding to the X tokens) are selected. For natural language processing tasks, the context\\nZ often contains the solution to a similar problem or exemplary solutions that guide the input and\\ninform the model. For biological and chemical sequences, the context Z could represent similar\\ngenetic regions, homologous proteins, or molecules with desired properties, enabling the model to\\nmake informed predictions or generate outputs based on these analogies.\\n3.2\\nMasked Language Modeling (MLM)\\nBio-xLSTM extends xLSTM to masked modeling of biological sequences, for which the typical\\nde-masking or de-noising objective (Vincent et al., 2010; Devlin et al., 2019) is used, concretely the\\nMLM loss: LMLM = EX\\u223cpX Et\\u223c[[1,T ]] EM\\u223cpM CE (xt, xLSTM(X \\u2299M)t) ,\\n(2)\\nwhere M \\u2208{0, 1}D\\u00d7T is a random matrix with binary entries which are usually drawn from a\\nBernoulli distribution pM, and \\u2299is element-wise multiplication. The objective measures how\\nwell the original sequence X can be reconstructed from a noisy version X \\u2299M by the model\\nxLSTM : RD\\u00d7T 7\\u2192RD\\u00d7T . This modeling paradigm has also been called bidirectional modeling. It\\nhas been highly successful in learning representations of proteins at evolutionary scale (Rives et al.,\\n2021), which has powered many subsequent applications such as protein engineering and machine-\\nlearning guided directed evolution (Yang et al., 2019). For details on how xLSTM is extended to the\\nMLM setting, we refer to Appendix Section B.5.\\n4\\n3.3\\nReverse complement (RC) equivariance\\nWe develop an xLSTM block that is equivariant to the RC of an input sequence, a property particularly\\nrelevant to DNA-based applications. In double-helix DNA structures, both strands are semantically\\nequivalent, with one strand being the RC of the other. The RC strand is oriented in the opposite\\ndirection of the forward strand, with base pairs converted from A to T and C to G. Shrikumar et al.\\n(2017) show that a data-driven approach to learn the equivalence between RC sequences can fail.\\nTherefore, Schiff et al. (2024) propose to enforce RC-equivariance by design, making use of two\\ndifferent inductive biases, post-hoc conjoining (PH) (Zhou et al., 2022) and parameter sharing (PS),\\nin the architecture. In PH architectures, the backbone is trained to handle both DNA sequences and\\ntheir RCs by applying RC augmentations during pre-training. For downstream tasks, PH architectures\\nare applied to both the original sequence and its RC, and their outputs are summed to reach overall\\nRC invariance. In contrast, PS architectures integrate RC-equivariant xLSTM blocks with equivariant\\nword embeddings and language model heads similar to Schiff et al. (2024). For additional details, see\\nAppendix Section C.4.\\n3.4\\nDNA-xLSTM\\nFor the DNA domain, we propose the DNA-xLSTM architecture to enhance sequence modeling\\ncapabilities, particularly for varying context lengths. We introduce three model configurations\\nbased on DNA-xLSTM: two sLSTM-based configurations trained with a context window of 1,024\\ntokens (DNA-xLSTM-500k and DNA-xLSTM-2M), and an mLSTM-based configuration trained\\nwith a context window of 32,768 tokens (DNA-xLSTM-4M). The short-context configuration, DNA-\\nxLSTM-500k, has an embedding dimension of 128, 5 sLSTM blocks, an up-projection ratio of\\n1.25:1 to match the baseline model parameter count, and a total parameter count of 500k, while\\nDNA-xLSTM-2M has an embedding dimension of 256, 6 sLSTM blocks, a 1:1 up-projection\\nratio, and 2M parameters. The long-context configuration, DNA-xLSTM-4M, has an embedding\\ndimension of 256, 9 mLSTM blocks, a 2:1 up-projection ratio, and is augmented with Rotary Position\\nEncodings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2024a) to handle long-range dependencies effectively, with a total of\\n4M parameters. All three configurations are trained with both CLM and MLM. Furthermore, we\\nintroduce RC-equivariant versions, xLSTM-PH and xLSTM-PS, which use the original sequence and\\nits reverse complement (RC). We trained models with these configurations on the human genome\\nand benchmarked them against state-of-the-art DNA models, such as Transformers, DNA-Mamba\\n(Caduceus) (Schiff et al., 2024), and HyenaDNA (Nguyen et al., 2023), showing competitive or better\\nperformance on pre-training and downstream classification tasks (see Section 4.1).\\n3.5\\nProt-xLSTM\\nFor the protein domain, we propose the architectural variant Prot-xLSTM to address the complexities\\nof protein sequence data, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies to enable homology-\\nconditioned modeling. We introduce two configurations: Prot-xLSTM-26M and Prot-xLSTM-102M,\\nwith 26M and 102M parameters, respectively. Both configurations consist of 16 mLSTM blocks,\\nwith embedding dimensions of 512 for Prot-xLSTM-26M and 1,024 for Prot- xLSTM-102M and\\nmaintaining a consistent 2:1 projection ratio across both configurations, and are trained with increasing\\ncontext sizes ranging from 2,048 to 262,144 tokens. To effectively manage the wide range of protein\\nsequence lengths and context sizes, RoPEs are implemented for Prot-xLSTM. The according Prot-\\nxLSTM models are trained with CLM using a FIM strategy on non-aligned homologous sequences,\\nenabling them to perform ICL at inference time in two modes: a) generative and b) inpainting. Both\\napproaches can be used for protein design, with the latter also suited for residue-based predictions,\\nsuch as mutant fitness estimation. Prot-xLSTM shows better performance than similarly configured\\nMamba- and Transformer-based models and shows promising results for homology-conditioned\\nsequence generation (see Section 4.2).\\n3.6\\nChem-xLSTM\\nFor the chemical sequence domain, we introduce Chem-xLSTM to enhance generative modeling\\nof SMILES strings (Weininger, 1988), enabling domain-conditioned generation of small molecules\\nwithout fine-tuning. We introduce two models: an unconditional generative model trained with a\\ncontext length of 100 tokens (Chem-xLSTM-15M) and a domain-conditioned model trained with a\\n5\\n4,096-token context for in-context learning tasks (Chem-xLSTM-15M-icl). The latter can generate\\nmolecules within a specific domain without fine-tuning only based on examples provided as context, a\\nhighly sought-after capability in drug discovery. Both models are configured to have 15M parameters,\\nconsist of 9 mLSTM blocks with an embedding dimension of 512 and a 1.3:1 projection ratio.\\nThe models have been benchmarked against other generative models for SMILES and at their ICL\\ncapabilities (see Section 4.3).\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Hao Wang Hirofumi Shimizu Daisuke Kawahara Waseda University {conan1024hao@akane., bowen1205@toki., dkw@}waseda.jp\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n\n... # only display 7 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

To do so we use common techniques in circuit analysis, mainly direct logit attribution, activation patching, and attention pattern analysis.\\nDirect Logit Attribution. Every model component adds a vector $f^{c}({\\\\bf x})$ to the residual stream, and the last residual stream state gets projected onto the unembedding matrix, producing the logits distribution. Due to the linearity of the residual stream, the direct effect of a component to the logits can be measured by projecting its output onto the unembedding matrix, $f^{c}({\\\\bf x})W_{U}$ .

A Transformer LM can be seen as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing a causal model (Geiger et al., 2021; Pearl, 2009; Vig et al., 2020), where nodes are model components, and edges representations. During the forward pass on the corrupted input x we can intervene on the value of a node, $f^{c}({\\\\bf x})$ , or residual stream state, $f^{l}(\\\\mathbf{x})$ by taking the activation value from the forward pass on the clean input x\\u02dc. This is referred to as denoising activation patching (Vig et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2022).
