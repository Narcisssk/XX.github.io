{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Since the prominent approaches \\u2013 risk\\/coverage curves (El-Yaniv et al., 2010), receiver-operator (ROC) curves (Davis and Goadrich, 2006), and precision-recall curves (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2017) \\u2013 share many of the same benefits and drawbacks (some of which we discuss in this section), we will focus on precision-recall curves, mainly due to the NLP community\\u2019s increased familiarity with them. In Figure 3, we show the precision-recall curves for the six confidence functions from the previous subsection. The aspiration of any confidence function is to achieve an Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR) of 1, which means that it has perfectly separated the correct and incorrect predictions of the prediction function. Among the examples, this has been achieved by confidence functions g2 $g_{2}^{(A)}$ and g2 . $g_{2}^{(B)}$\\nA drawback with AUPR (and its analogs) is that its value is not interpretable without knowledge of the goodness of the associated prediction function. To see why, suppose we replace confidence function g $g_{1}^{(A)}$ with a random confidence function $g_{\\\\mathsf{r n d}}$ , i.e. we choose each confidence $g_{\\\\mathsf{r n d}}(x)$ uniformly at random from the interval $(0,1)$ . Empirically, we observe an average $\\\\mathrm{AUPR}^{1}$ of approximately 0.64 for a random confidence function $g_{\\\\mathsf{r n d}}$ associated with prediction function $f^{(A)}$ . Since this is considerably worse than the AUPR (0.863) of confidence function $g_{1}^{(A)}$ , we can surmise that confidence function g(1A) is \\u201cbetter than random\\u201d. By contrast, a random confidence function associated with the superior prediction function $f^{(B)}$ yields a empirical average AUPR2 of approximately 0.91, which is considerably better than the AUPR (0.865) of confidence function g(1B) \\u2013 thus confidence function (1B) is \\u201cworse than random\\u201d.\\nBoth g $g_{1}^{(A)}$ and g1 $g_{1}^{(B)}$ have AUPRs of approximately 0.86, but the former is \\u201cbetter than random,\\\" while the latter is \\u201cworse than random.\\\"\\nThus, AUPR does not provide a standalone indicator of the quality of a confidence function. This is because AUPR is a composite of the goodness of the confidence function and the goodness of the prediction function. One could imagine calibrating AUPR by taking into account the worst-case AUPR (i.e. the AUPRs for worst-case confidence functions g3 $g_{3}^{(A)}$ and $g_{3}^{(B)},$ ) but we will adopt an even simpler approach based on a recent proposal by (Xin et al., 2021).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.4 Evaluation with Kendall-tau Distance\",\"section_content\":\"If we sort predictions by increasing confidence (as in Figure 4), a best-case confidence function (e.g. $g_{2}^{(A\\\\bar{)}},$ ) ranks all incorrect predictions below all correct predictions, while a worst-case confidence function (e.g. $g_{3}^{(A)})$ ranks all correct predictions below all incorrect predictions. Observing this, (Xin et al., 2021) proposed a rank-based evaluation metric for selective prediction called Reversed Pair Proportion (RPP), which is a normalized count of pairwise ranking errors, i.e. a normalized version of Kendall-tau distance (Kendall, 1948):\\n\\nFor instance, confidence function g1 $g_{1}^{(A)}$ has a Kendall-tau distance of 7 (it misranks correct instance $x_{1}$ below 4 incorrect predictions, and instance $x_{3}$ below 3 incorrect predictions) and an RPP of $\\\\frac{7}{100}$ . For the best-case confidence function $g_{2}^{(A)}$ , $\\\\widehat{\\\\tau_{f,{\\\\bf x}}}(g_{2}^{(A)})\\\\ =\\\\ {\\\\tt R P P}_{f,{\\\\bf x}}(g_{2}^{(A)})\\\\ =\\\\ 0$ . Unfortunately, using $|\\\\mathbf{x}|^{2}$ as the normalizer means that RPP suffers the same issue as AUPR: its value cannot be interpreted independently of the goodness of the prediction function. Consider the RPP $g_{1}^{(B)}$ . Like $g_{1}^{(A)}$ , it has a Kendall-tau distance of 7 (it misranks incorrect instance $x_{8}$ above 7 correct predictions) and thus an RPP of $\\\\frac{7}{100}$ . Even though g(1A) is better than random and g(1B is worse than random, they end up with the same RPP.\\nFortunately, there is a simple remedy: all we need to do is normalize by the worst-case Kendalltau distance $c(|\\\\mathbf{x}|-c)$ , where $c$ is the number of correct predictions made by the prediction function. To obtain a metric with a similar interpretation to accuracy and AUPR (for which higher values are \\u201cbetter\\u201d), we subtract this new normalized distance from one, resulting in a measurement we call refinement:\\n\\nIn other words, a best-case confidence function has a refinement of 1, whereas a worst-case confidence function has a refinement of 0. Moreover: Theorem 2. For a random confidence function $g$ , the expected value of $\\\\mathcal{R}_{f,\\\\mathbf{x}}(g)$ is 0.5. Proof. Define binary random variable $Z_{i j}$ such that $Z_{i j}=1$ iff $g(x_{i})<g(x_{j})$ . According to the definition of Kendall-tau distance:\\nBy linearity of expectation:\\nwhere $c=|\\\\mathcal{C}(f,\\\\mathbf{x})|$ . Refinement has the following appealing properties:\\nTheorem 1. If $0<|\\\\mathcal{C}(f,\\\\mathbf{x})|<|\\\\mathbf{x}|$ (i.e. prediction function $f$ makes at least one correct prediction and at least one incorrect prediction), then:\\nAnd therefore:\\nProof. Consider prediction function $f$ and instance set $\\\\mathbf{x}$ such that $0<|\\\\mathcal{C}(f,\\\\mathbf{x})|<|\\\\mathbf{x}|$ , which implies that $c(|\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\!-\\\\!c)>0$ . Since $0\\\\leq\\\\tau_{f,\\\\mathbf{x}}(g)\\\\leq c(|\\\\mathbf{x}|\\\\!-\\\\!c)$ , therefore $0\\\\leq\\\\mathcal{R}_{f,\\\\mathbf{x}}(g)\\\\leq1$ . To prove the theorem, then, we need only show these bounds are tight, i.e. construct two confidence functions $g_{\\\\mathsf{m i n}}(x)$ and $g_{\\\\mathsf{m a x}}(x)$ such that $g_{\\\\mathrm{min}}(x)=0$ and $g_{\\\\mathsf{m a x}}(x)=1$ . Let:\\nUnlike RPP and the various area under the curve metrics, refinement directly assesses the quality of the confidence function, and its value is calibrated and interpretable ( $\\\\mathrm{0}=$ worst case, $0.5=$ random confidence, $1.0=$ best case) without knowledge of the quality of the associated prediction function.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Results\",\"section_content\":\"For final evaluation, we ran ten experiment trials on the six GLUE tasks. Specifically, we trained ten prediction functions with different random seeds for each loss function: the basic BERT loss (basic), BERT loss with error regularization (ereg.b, where $\\\\mathrm{~b~}\\\\in\\\\{8,16\\\\}$ is the minibatch size), and the Deep Abstaining Classifier loss (dac). For each resulting prediction function, we evaluated the various confidence functions. In all experiment trials, we used the hyperparameter settings established in Section 4. Figure 5 visualizes the results9 for two GLUE datasets (MRPC and SST-2) using a violin plot10. Each \\u201cstring\\u201d of the violin corresponds to the refinement of a single trial on GLUEDEV, while the \\u201cbody\\u201d of the violin is a kernel density estimation of the result distribution. These results indicate that all techniques have considerable variation from trial to trial, and that each outperforms a random confidence baseline (which has an expected refinement of 0.5, according to Theorem 2). Beyond this, it is difficult to eyeball the results and make an informed decision about which technique to use. One can possibly eliminate\\nTRUSTSCORE based on Figure 5, but what should we make of the advantages that MCDM and MCDV seem to offer over the basic MAXPROB approach? The MC Dropout techniques are considerably more expensive to run (since they require multiple independent decodings). Are they meaningfully better than MAXPROB?\\nWe quantify the phrase \\u201cmeaningfully better\\u201d by estimating the likelihood that a candidate technique outperforms the basic MAXPROB baseline. For a candidate technique $t$ and evaluation metric $m$ define random variable $X_{t,m}$ as the result of the following trial:\\n\\u2022 Choose a random task from a probability distribution $P_{\\\\mathit{t a s k}}$ over tasks.   \\n\\u2022 Execute the candidate selective prediction technique $t$ and the baseline technique (i.e. MAXPROB) and evaluate each using metric $m$ (e.g. refinement or AUPR).   \\n\\u2022 If the candidate technique $t$ outperforms the baseline according to metric $m$ , return 1. Otherwise, return 0.\\nThe expected value $\\\\boldsymbol{E}(\\\\boldsymbol{X}_{t,m})$ tells us the likelihood that technique $t$ will outperform the baseline according to metric $m$ . Since we performed 10 trials for each of 6 GLUE tasks, we therefore have 60 samples11 for estimating $\\\\boldsymbol{E}(\\\\boldsymbol{X}_{t,m})$ . Figure 6 shows the $E(X_{t,\\\\mathsf{r e f i n e m e n t}})$ estimate for eight techniques (including the random confidence baseline), along with a $95\\\\%$ confidence interval. Somewhere between $62\\\\%$ to $85\\\\%$ of the time (with $95\\\\%$ confidence), both MCDM and MCDV improve upon the MAXPROB baseline according to refinement.\\nOn its own, refinement is sufficient to evaluate the techniques that only modify the confidence function (i.e. MCDM, MCDV, and TRUSTSCORE). Techniques that employ specialized loss functions, (e.g. error-regularization or DAC loss) should be evaluated using both refinement and AUPR, since these techniques might improve the efficiency of the confidence function while simultaneously sacrificing the quality of the prediction function. Simultaneous evaluation with AUPR and refinement allows us to distinguish whether improvements are achieved via enhancements to the confidence or the prediction function. In these experiments, AUPR and refinement largely agree about the quality of the loss specialization techniques, thus the techniques do not appear to impact the quality of the prediction function. In terms of improving the confidence function, EREG shows promise, but the trajectory of performance from minibatch size 8 to minibatch size 16 suggests that EREG needs a minibatch size of at least 32 to be a superior alternative to MAXPROB.\"}\n\nIn total, 4 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
