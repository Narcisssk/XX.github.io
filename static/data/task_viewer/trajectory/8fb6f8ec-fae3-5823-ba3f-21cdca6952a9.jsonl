{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

For the empirical modeling analysis and performance benchmarking, we randomly split the dataset into 3 sets: train $(70\\\\%)$ , dev $(5\\\\%)$ , and test $(25\\\\%)$ sets, while ensuring both domains (fashion and furniture) have the same split distributions.\\nBaselines. To benchmark the dataset, we adopt: (a) MM-DST Model is a 12-layered multi-task GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019; Kottur et al., 2021) trained with joint supervision signals from MM-Coref, MM-DST, and response generation tasks, inspired by causal language modeling approach to dialog systems (Peng et al., 2020; Hosseini-Asl et al., 2020). The inputs to the model include both the dialog context (utterances) and the multimodal contexts fattened as structurally formatted text strings, where the outputs are the predicted DST labels. This baseline has two versions: one uses the ground-truth multimodal contexts provided from the scene generator (hence a soft oracle) to simulate the outputs from a robust object detector or from a controlled VR environment, whereas the other has to infer visual descriptors from raw videos, simulating real-world scenarios.\\n(b) Adapted-VIOLET Model is a multimodal video-language model based on VIOLET ( $\\\\mathrm{Fu}$ et al.), adapted to ft our task structure (Figure 6). Due to computational limitations, we randomly sub-sample 10 \\u2212 15 video frames during training (while ensuring a proportion of these frames contain objects of ground-truth coreferences), and sweep through the entire video for test-time inference with a fxed window-size. In addition to the frame-level whole image feature, we feed the dense object descriptor features extracted in each groundtruth bounding boxes (assuming a perfect object detector) to the model for the MM-Coref task.5\\n\\nAll baseline models are trained for ten epochs, and the best model on the dev set is used for test.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.1 Experimental Results\",\"section_content\":\"Table 5 summarizes the model performance and the probabilistic guess performance (proportional to training label distributions) for each sub-task.\\nMain Results. The baselines show strong overall performances especially in the DST task. The MM-Coref is understandably a very challenging task (resolving tens of items over moving frames), as evidenced in the relatively low scores \\u2013 suggesting areas for future research. It is worth noting that without the ground truth multimodal contexts for assistant turns, the MM-DST model performs close to zero, indicating that the created dataset does not leak unintended artifacts for the object mentions (that language-only models can easily exploit without visual contexts). For the failure mode prediction, we prepare a test-set that focuses on the active scene utterances, where the random guess roughly equates to the amount of the failure probabilities $(30\\\\%)$ . We expect the future modeling efforts can better perceive discrepancies between the visual behaviors and the instructed guidance.\\nEffects of Temporal Grounding. We break down the MM-Coref performance by identifying coref utterances with temporal dependencies. With the Adapted-VIOLET model, we get an F1 of 10.5 for utterances without temporal dependencies, and a signifcantly lower 2.81 for the others \\u2013 suggesting the diffculty in encoding long-standing contexts.\\n\\nComparison with 2.0.

Each taskoriented dialog mimics real-world shopping scenarios where the assistant\\u2019s goal is to help the user make purchases and navigate through the environment. In each instance, the user walks around a virtual shop while the assistant provides product information or recommendations; as well as help the user locate and navigate to products of interest.\\n\\nDataset Collection Strategy. Multimodal or embodied dialogs (Das et al., 2017a; Padmakumar et al., 2022) are often constructed via a two-player game where participants interact with the environment and converse with each other (i.e. in a Wizard of $\\\\mathrm{Oz}$ (WOZ) (Mrk\\u0161i\\u00b4c et al., 2017; Budzianowski et al., 2018a) role-playing fashion). However, it can be overly challenging to require annotators to role-play as the AI assistant in our complex and quite cluttered VR shop environments $(>\\\\!100$ products). Furthermore, to match the potential retroactive reasoning shopping scenarios (e.g. concerning products priorly seen\\/mentioned), it could add much mental burden for annotators to memorize object attributes and their locations while composing authentic long dialogue interactions. Lastly, in conjunction with the aforementioned diffculties, it is rather unscalable and inextensible to manually annotate all the required labels (dialog acts, coreferences) cross-referencing complex moving scenes for a task-oriented dialog dataset.\\nWe therefore collect the dataset through two phases: (1) simulating multimodal dialog fows with templated utterances \\u2013 thereby programmatically generating fne-grained-scene-grounded annotations and systematically ensuring the diversity of the conversations, and (2) manual paraphrasing, which ensures the naturalness of utterances with a signifcantly less annotation overhead (Rastogi et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2018).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 SIMMC-VR Dataset Analysis\",\"section_content\":\"Table 4 shows the essential dataset statistics.
