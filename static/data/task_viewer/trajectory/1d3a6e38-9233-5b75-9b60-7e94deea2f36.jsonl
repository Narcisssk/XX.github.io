{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We select 32 widely-known charac-\\nters, 16 from ChatHaruhi5 and 16 from RoleLLM.\\nThe characters are mainly from popular fictional\\nworks, such as Harry Potter, The Big Bang Theory\\nand Genshin Impact. Please refer to \\u00a7C for the\\ndetailed character selection process. The character\\ndata from ChatHaruhi and RoleLLM includes de-\\nscriptions and dialogues used for system prompts\\nand memory modules. To implement RPAs, we ap-\\nply the Chat-Haruhi-Suzumiya6 library, and adopt\\nGPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022) as the foundation LLM\\nby default.\\nPsychological Scales\\nWe consider 14 psycho-\\nlogical scales, including the BFI, the 16P, and 12\\nother scales following PsychoBench7 (Huang et al.,\\n2024) to evaluate RPAs. Most scales apply scoring\\nschemes like average and sum, while the 16P is\\nclose-source and accessed via its API. Detailed in-\\ntroduction of these scales can be found in \\u00a7B. Due\\nto page limitations, the main body presents results\\nfor the BFI and 16P, while additional findings are\\ndetailed in the Appendix.\\nPersonality Labels\\nWe collect labels for char-\\nacter personalities in the form of both scores and\\ntypes, contributed by people familiar with these\\ncharacters. From the PDb, an online platform for\\ncharacter personality annotation, we derive scores\\nof the BFI and 16P on each dimension from its\\nlabel percentage (e.g., 60% Extroverted). We then\\ncategorize it into a type of either positive, negative,\\nor marginal if it is above 60%, under 40%, or oth-\\nerwise. Then, we invite human annotators for com-\\nprehensive personality labels on all 14 scales. To\\nselect qualified annotators, we examine their char-\\nacter understanding of the BFI and 16P, matching\\nwith labels from the PDb. We invite two to three an-\\nnotators for each character (93 in total for 32 char-\\nacters) and average their results for improved relia-\\nbility and objectivity.

For the BFI and 16P, we adopt types from\\nthe PDb and scores from our invited annotators.\\nThe details about PDb annotations, our human an-\\nnotation process, intra-annotator consistency, and\\nother statistics can be found in \\u00a7D.\\nInterviewer LLMs\\nWe use LLMs to accomplish\\nthe OC, d-OC and ER tasks in the assessment phase\\nof INCHARACTER, or to extract selected options\\nfrom RPA responses in self-report methods if RPAs\\ndo not provide exactly the choice. We consider four\\nwidely-acknowledged LLMs, including GPT-3.5,\\nGPT-4, Gemini and Qwen1.5-110B 8.\\nMetrics\\nWe consider two sets of metrics, namely:\\n(1) Measured alignment (MA) compares the mea-\\nsured personalities of RPAs and human-annotated\\npersonalities of characters. It depends both on the\\nperformance of RPAs and the effectiveness of per-\\nsonality test methods. We categorize RPAs as pos-\\nitive or negative on each dimension if the scores\\nare above or below the median of the scoring range.\\nThen, we calculate mean absolute error (MAE)\\nand accuracy to measure alignment at the score and\\ntype level, respectively. We re-scale MAE by divid-\\ning it with the scoring range length. For accuracy,\\nwe report the average AccDim and AccFull, where\\ncorrectness is judged on individual or all dimen-\\nsions of each scale. The marginal dimensions of\\neach character are ignored due to their ambiguity.\\n(2) Personality consistency (PC) indicates whether\\nthe measured personality of RPAs is consistent\\nacross various settings. We analyze the standard\\nvariance at the item-level (StdItem), dimension-\\nlevel (StdDim), and score-level (StdScore). StdItem\\nand StdDim measure the consistency of an RPA\\u2019s\\nscores on individual items. For INCHARACTER,\\nwe experiment with OC and d-OC to convert re-\\nsponses into scores. StdItem measures an RPA\\u2019s\\nconsistency on the same item across multiple runs.\\nStdDim compares an RPA\\u2019s responses across differ-\\nent items in the same dimension. StdScore denotes\\nthe variance of an RPA\\u2019s score on each dimension\\nacross multiple runs. We divide these metrics by\\nthe length of the corresponding scoring range to\\nre-scale them into the unit interval.\\n8The versions in this paper are gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,\\ngpt-4-1106-preview, gemini-pro, Qwen1.5-110B-Chat\\nrespectively.\\n1844\\n\"}\n{\"paper_id\":\"9b3a636d-5184-58d5-9333-49a304ad2f68\",\"title\":\"On the Humanity of Conversational AI: Evaluating the Psychological Portrayal of LLMs\",\"page_content\":\"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nON THE HUMANITY OF CONVERSATIONAL AI: EVAL-\\nUATING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PORTRAYAL OF LLMS\\nJen-tse Huang1\\u2217\\n, Wenxuan Wang1\\u2217, Eric John Li1, Man Ho Lam1, Shujie Ren3,\\nYouliang Yuan4\\u2217, Wenxiang Jiao2\\u2020\\n, Zhaopeng Tu2, Michael R.

Our study examines five popular models, namely text-davinci-003,\\nChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA-2-7b, and LLaMA-2-13b.

For example, ChatGPT1 has showcased its ability to\\naddress diverse natural language processing tasks (Qin et al., 2023), spanning question answering,\\nsummarization, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis. The wide spread of ChatGPT\\nhas facilitated the development of LLMs, encompassing both commercial-level applications such\\nas Claude2 and open-source alternatives like LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023). In the meantime,\\nthe applications of LLMs have spread far beyond computer science, prospering the field of clinical\\nmedicine (Cascella et al., 2023), legal advice (Deroy et al., 2023; Nay et al., 2023) and educa-\\ntion (Dai et al., 2023b). From the users\\u2019 perspective, LLMs are changing how individuals interact\\nwith computer systems. These models are replacing traditional tools such as search engines, trans-\\nlators, and grammar correctors, assuming an all-encompassing role as digital assistants, facilitating\\ntasks such as information retrieval (Dai et al., 2023a), language translation (Jiao et al., 2023) and\\ntext revision (Wu et al., 2023).\\nGiven the contemporary developments, LLMs have evolved beyond their conventional characteri-\\nzation as mere software tools, assuming the role of lifelike assistants.

Our selection encompasses variations\\nin model size, such as LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-2-13B and the evolution of the same model, i.e.,\\nthe update of GPT-3.5 to GPT-4.\\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 Guided by research in psychometrics, we present a framework, PsychoBench, for evaluating the\\npsychological portrayal of LLMs, containing thirteen widely-recognized scales categorized into\\nfour distinct domains.\\n\\u2022 Leveraging PsychoBench, we evaluate five LLMs, covering variations in model sizes, including\\nLLaMA-2 7B and 13B, and model updates, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\\n\\u2022 We provide further insights into the inherent characteristics of LLMs by utilizing a recently de-\\nveloped jailbreak method, the CipherChat.\\n\\u2022 Utilizing role assignments and downstream tasks like TruthfulQA and SafetyQA, we verify the\\nscales\\u2019 validity on LLM.\\n2\\nPSYCHOBENCH DESIGN\\nPsychometrics pertains to the theoretical and methodological aspects of assessing psychological at-\\ntributes. Tests in psychometrics can be roughly categorized into two: Personality Tests and Ability\\nTests (Cohen et al., 1996). Personality Tests encompass personality traits, interpersonal relationship\\nmeasurements, and motivational tests, while Ability Tests include knowledge, skills, reasoning abil-\\nities, and emotion assessment (Anastasi & Urbina, 1997; Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Personality\\nTests concentrate mainly on capturing individuals\\u2019 attitudes, beliefs, and values, which are aspects\\n3The human norm and average human in this study refer to some specific human populations rather than\\nrepresentative samples of global data.

In contrast, most Ability Tests are constructed with in-\\nquiries featuring objectively correct responses designed to quantify individuals\\u2019 proficiencies within\\nspecific domains. Researchers in the field of psychometrics have ensured that these assessments\\nmeasure consistently and accurately (i.e., their reliability and validity), thereby enabling dependable\\nand sound inferences about individuals based on their assessment scores.\\nThe selected questionnaires or scales integrated into our PsychoBench framework are listed in Fig. 1.\\nThese chosen scales have been widely used in clinical psychology, showing sufficient reliability and\\nvalidity. We categorize them into four main domains: personality traits, interpersonal relationships,\\nmotivational tests for Personality Tests, and emotional abilities for Ability Tests. Our study focuses\\non the more subjective scales. Hence, standardized tests for cognitive abilities and specific domain\\nknowledge, which have objectively right or wrong answers, are not in the scope of this paper. The\\ndetailed introduction of these scales, including each subscale and the sources of human responses,\\nis presented in \\u00a7A in the appendix.\\n3\\nEXPERIMENTS\\nThis section provides an overview of our utilization of PsychoBench to probe LLMs. We begin\\nwith the experimental settings, including model selection, prompt design, and metrics for analysis.\\nSubsequently, we present the outcomes obtained from all selected models, accompanied by compre-\\nhensive analyses. Last but not least, we employ a jailbreak technique to bypass the safety alignment\\nprotocols of GPT-4, enabling an in-depth exploration of its psychological portrayal.\\n3.1\\nEXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS\\nModel Selection\\nWe consider candidates from the OpenAI GPT family and the Meta AI LLaMA 2\\nfamily, including applications ranging from commercial-level to open-sourced models. Specifically,\\nwe select the following models based on different factors that may affect their behaviors:\\n\\u2022 Model Updates. We choose text-davinci-003, ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4,\\nwhich are three representative models released sequentially by OpenAI.\\n\\u2022 Model Sizes. We also choose the 7B and 13B versions of LLaMA-2 pre-trained by Meta AI using\\nthe same architecture, data, and training strategy. We obtain the model checkpoints from the\\nofficial Huggingface repository (Llama-2-7b-chat-hf5 and Llama-2-13b-chat-hf6).\\n\\u2022 Model Safety. Beyond GPT-4, we also set up a jailbroken GPT-4 to bypass the safety alignment\\nprotocol of GPT-4, using a recent method named CipherChat (Yuan et al., 2024). The motivation\\nis that most LLMs are explicitly designed to avoid responding to inquiries concerning personal\\nsentiments, emotions, and subjective experiences. This constraint is added by the safety align-\\nment during the model\\u2019s instructional tuning process. An intriguing question arises as to whether\\nthe psychological portrayal changes if the regulations from developers are relaxed. Yuan et al.\\n(2024) find that when chatting in a cipher-based language, such as Caesar cipher, Morse code, or\\nASCII, GPT-4 demonstrates a higher propensity to produce toxic or harmful content, seemingly\\ndisregarding its programmed safety restrictions. To acquire responses that reflect the true thoughts\\nof GPT-4, we apply a Caesar cipher with shift three on its prompts.\\nWe set the temperature parameter to zero when utilizing the official OpenAI API7 to obtain more\\ndeterministic results. To ensure consistency with OpenAI models, we set the temperature parameter\\nto 0.01 (since it cannot be zero) for LLaMA 2 models. All models are executed for inference\\nonly, without modifying their parameters. The inference of LLaMA 2 models is performed on two\\nNVIDIA A100 GPUs.\\nPrompt Design\\nTo simplify the processing of model responses and mitigate instances where mod-\\nels decline to reply to queries about personal opinions and experiences, we instruct LLMs to reply\\nonly a number within the Likert scale levels. Furthermore, we provide detailed explanations for the\\ninterpretation of each Likert level.\\n5https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/meta-llama\\/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\\n6https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/meta-llama\\/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf\\n7https:\\/\\/platform.openai.com\\/docs\\/api-reference\\/chat\\n4\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

There is ample work on aligning LLMs with human ethics and preferences, including data filtering in pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, red teaming, etc. In this study, we discover that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which are mainly conducted in natural languages. We propose a novel framework CipherChat to systematically examine the generalizability of safety alignment to non-natural languages -- ciphers. CipherChat enables humans to chat with LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot enciphered demonstrations. We use CipherChat to assess state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 for different representative human ciphers across 11 safety domains in both English and Chinese. Experimental results show that certain ciphers succeed almost 100% of the time in bypassing the safety alignment of GPT-4 in several safety domains, demonstrating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-natural languages. Notably, we identify that LLMs seem to have a ''secret cipher'', and propose a novel SelfCipher that uses only role play and several unsafe demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability. SelfCipher surprisingly outperforms existing human ciphers in almost all cases.\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
