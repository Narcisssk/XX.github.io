{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Introduction\\nDiffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) [33, 13, 35] have become the new prevailing generative models\\nand have achieved competitive performance on many tasks including image synthesis [8, 29, 13],\\nvideo synthesis [15], text-to-image generation [27, 29, 12], voice synthesis [5], etc. Different from\\nGANs [10] and VAEs [20], DPMs are trained to explicitly match the gradient of the data density\\n(i.e., score), which is more stable and less sensitive to hyper-parameters. However, sampling from\\na pre-trained DPM usually requires multiple model evaluations to gradually perform denoising\\nfrom Gaussian noise [13], consuming more inference time and computational costs compared with\\nsingle-step generative models like GANs.\\nRecently, there have been increasing efforts to accelerate the sampling of DPMs [31, 28, 34, 25, 40].\\nAmong those, training-free methods [34, 25, 40] enjoy a wider usage in applications because they\\ncan be directly applied to off-the-shelf pre-trained DPMs. Although these methods have significantly\\nreduced the sampling steps from 1000 to less than 20 steps, the sampling quality with extremely few\\nsteps (e.g., <10) has been rarely investigated. Few-step sampling can be used in many scenarios\\nwhere we need to efficiently obtain plausible samples, such as designing a proper prompt for a text-\\nto-image diffusion model [29, 30] and computing losses on the generated samples during the training\\nof some diffusion-based visual systems [1, 6]. However, current fast samplers usually struggle to\\ngenerate high-quality samples within 10 steps (see Figure 1).\\n\\u2217Equal contribution.\\n\\u2020Corresponding author.\\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\\nDDIM (order = 1)\\n[34]\\nDEIS (order = 2)\\n[40]\\nDPM-Solver++ (order = 2)\\n[26]\\nUniPC (order = 3)\\n(Ours)\\nFigure 1: Qualitative comparisons between our UniPC and previous methods. All images are\\ngenerated by sampling from a DPM trained on ImageNet 256\\u00d7256 with only 7 number of function\\nevaluations (NFE) and a classifier scale of 8.0. We show that our proposed UniPC can generate\\nmore plausible samples with more visual details compared with previous first-order sampler [34] and\\nhigh-order samplers [40, 26]. Best viewed in color.\\nIn this paper, we propose a training-free framework for the fast sampling of DPMs called UniPC. We\\nfind that UniPC significantly outperforms existing methods within 5\\u223c10 NFE (number of function\\nevaluations), and can also achieve better sampling quality with more sampling steps. Specifically,\\nwe first develop a unified corrector (UniC) which works by using the the model output \\u03f5\\u03b8(xti, ti)\\nat the current timestep ti to obtain a refined xc\\nti. Different from the predictor-corrector paradigm in\\nnumerical ODE solver that requires a doubled NFE, our UniC reuses the model output \\u03f5\\u03b8(xti, ti)\\nto the next sampling step, thus introducing no extra function evaluation. UniC can be applied after\\nany existing DPM sampler to increase the order of accuracy, while the inference speed is almost\\nunaffected. Interestingly, we also find that by simply changing a hyper-parameter in UniC, a new\\nfamily of predictors (UniP) can be further obtained.\\nSince our UniC is method-agnostic, we combine UniP and UniC to obtain a new family of fast\\nsamplers called UniPC. Different from previous fast solvers [26, 25, 40] that either have no higher-\\norder (e.g., > 3) variants or have no explicit forms, our UniPC supports arbitrary orders with a unified\\nanalytical expression and are easy to implement. Benefiting from the universal design, variants of\\nUniPC (e.g., singlestep\\/multistep, noise\\/data prediction) can be easily derived. We theoretically\\nprove that UniPC enjoys higher convergence order and empirically demonstrate that UniPC has better\\nsampling quality in a variety of scenarios. We also show that the inference speed and memory usage\\nof UniPC is similar to DPM-Solver++ [26], indicating that UniPC can achieve superior performance\\nunder the same computational budgets.\\nWe conduct extensive experiments with both pixel-space and latent-space DPMs to verify the\\neffectiveness of the proposed UniPC. Our results show that UniPC performs consistently better than\\nprevious state-of-the-art methods on both unconditional and conditional sampling tasks. Notably,\\nUniPC can achieve 3.87 FID on CIFAR10 (unconditional) and 7.51 FID on ImageNet 256 \\u00d7 256\\n(conditional) with only 10 function evaluations. We also demonstrate that UniC can improve the\\nsampling quality of several existing fast samplers significantly with very few NFE (number of function\\nevaluations). Some qualitative comparisons are shown in Figure 1, where we observe that our UniPC\\ncan generate images with more visual details than other methods.\\n2\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
