{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

LLM-based agents), which aim to simulate human behaviors in real-world scenarios through their planning capabilities (Liu et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023; Akata et al., 2023). However, planning in the real world involves temporal and resource constraints (Russell and Norvig, 2010), which are rarely implemented in most textual simulations for LLMs and language agents (Wang et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023).\\nThe integration of time in simulated environments challenges agents to navigate and align with human-like effcient multitasking skills. Such a\\nFigure 1: An example illustrating multitasking with temporal constraints in TIMEARENA. The completion of tasks requires actions in a predetermined dependency and order. Underlined actions do not occupy the agent, allowing other actions to be processed by the agent simultaneously. The Wait action skips the current time step, meaning the agent is idle.\\nsimulation requires the agent to consider the following three factors: 1) Time Duration and Dependency: Actions will have durations upon dependencies, requiring agents to strategize and prioritize based on time constraints and task completion progress. 2) Agent Occupancy: Agents will be occupied by certain actions; thus, they might be unable to perform other actions at the same time. 3) Object Occupancy: Some objects might be occupied for some time, and agents must use available objects in the environment for the tasks. These factors are common in real life but are seldom addressed by current textual simulations.\\nTo help illustrate, Figure 1 shows an example of completing make tea (Task 1) and wash clothes (Task 2). The actions of each task might depend on previous actions, e.g., agents must boil water before make tea, and each action takes a duration in time, e.g., wash cup takes 5 minutes. In particular, some actions let agents be idle, allowing agents to carry out other actions. For example, wash clothes in washing machine allows agents to perform other actions at the same time. Moreover, actions temporarily occupy objects, making them unavailable for other actions and hindering parallel processing. For example, boil water occupies the pot, delaying other actions like cook soup until it is available. When no action is currently available for the agent, the only option is to wait. For example, in Solution 2, the agent must wait for the completion of wash clothes in washing machine, before hang clothes.\\n\\nIn this work, we introduce TIMEARENA, a textual simulated environment featuring 30 real-world tasks involving cooking, household activity, and laboratory work. TIMEARENA is the frst textual simulation to evaluate language agents on multitasking effciency. Specifcally, we incorporate the time duration of each action and set two types of actions based on agent occupancy. One type occupies agents (e.g., wash cup) and another lets agents be idle (e.g., boil water). Additionally, we simulate resource competition by implementing object occupancy, i.e., an object used for one task cannot be simultaneously used for another, which is common in parallel processing. Therefore, agents must focus on parallel processing, taking into account the occupancy of agents and objects, to minimize time consumption. We design four metrics in TIMEARENA to evaluate the average progress score, completion speed, task completion rate and average completion time. These metrics help to assess and analyze the effcient multitasking capabilities of language agents. Our comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs on TIMEARENA shows that current language agents struggle in effcient multitasking. Even the most powerful LLM, GPT-4, still faces challenges in parallel processing. In summary, our contributions are as follows:\\n\\u2022 To the best of our knowledge, we are the frst to explore the notion of time of language agents in a textual environment, which is important for more realistic simulation.\\n\\u2022 We create TIMEARENA, a novel text-based simulated environment consisting of 30 tasks, where LLMs can complete multiple tasks in parallel.\\n\\u2022 Using TIMEARENA, we conduct rich experiments to evaluate the effcient multitasking capabilities of language agents.

These simulated environments can be divided into two categories: 1) Social Simulations (Park et al., 2023; Mukobi et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023), which aim to evaluate the behaviors of language agents in some social scenarios; 2) Problem-solving simulations, which are created based on games (Chen et al., 2023a,b; Zhang et al., 2023; Agashe et al., 2023) and scientifc scenarios (Wang et al., 2022). In this paper, we focus on problem-solving simulations to investigate the effcient multitasking capabilities of language agents.\\nLanguage Planning Language planning aims to decompose a complex task into steps (Schank and Abelson, 1975, 2013). Early studies mainly focus on imbuing language models with planning capabilities by training them on specifc planning datasets (Peng et al., 2018; Hua et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2021), which exhibits poor generalization. Recent studies have identifed that LLMs can effectively decompose tasks into procedural steps (Wang et al., 2023c; Yuan et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023). However, multitasking planning with parallel processing in dynamic environments still remains under-studied.\\nTemporal Reasoning Temporal reasoning involves comprehending, structuring, and interpreting events, actions, and states through the lens of time (Allen, 1991; Vila, 1994; Stock, 1998). Previous studies in temporal reasoning focus on temporal relation extraction (Vashishtha et al., 2019; Mathur et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023b), event temporal reasoning (Mathur et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Wang and Zhao, 2023) and explore the temporal reasoning capability of LLMs with several contemporary time-sensitive QA datasets (Zhang and Choi, 2021; Shang et al., 2022; Tan et al., 2023). Distinguished from other benchmarks (Chu et al., 2023), our TIMEARENA creates a dynamic and interactive simulated environment.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 TIMEARENA\",\"section_content\":\"We create TIMEARENA, a textual simulated environment to evaluate the effcient multitasking capabilities of language agents.

This simulation emphasizes the importance of understanding, performing, and optimizing actions within a constrained timeframe, mirroring practical scenarios involving time management.\\nCentral to TIMEARENA are Tasks, Objects, and Actions. Tasks defne the objectives for the agents, Objects represent elements in the environment that agents will encounter and interact with, and Actions are the means to accomplish these tasks. Realtime feedback and scoring mechanisms are integral to the environment, assessing agent performance and adding to the simulation\\u2019s complexity and realism. Unique features like the duration and occupancy of actions and strategic resource utilization distinguish TIMEARENA from other environments.\\n\\nAn Example Run As in Figure 2, consider an agent tasked with make tea (Task 1), wash clothes (Task 2) and wash bed sheet (Task 3). The agent starts by decomposing the task into actions like boil water. In TIMEARENA, all actions have a duration (e.g., Boil water needs 8 minutes) and dependencies. (e.g., At $\\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathrm{T}=4\\\\operatorname*{min}$ , make tea violates the dependency because wash teapot and boil water are not completed yet.) The agent then interacts with objects (e.g., wash clothes in washing machine), which become occupied during the process. The agent can engage in non-occupied actions simultaneously (e.g., wash teapot) while others (e.g., boil water) are in progress. Environmental feedback guides the agent, indicating the legitimacy of actions and the completion of tasks. For example, if the washing machine is occupied, the agent adjusts its strategy. The agent\\u2019s goal is to complete all the tasks effciently, with performance evaluated based on progress and completion time.\\nThis dynamic interaction in TIMEARENA fosters an environment where strategic planning, resource management, and adaptability are key to an agent\\u2019s success.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.2 Components of TIMEARENA\",\"section_content\":\"Tasks In TIMEARENA, we design tasks within three distinct scenarios or simulated settings, namely, household activity, cooking, and laboratory work. Each scenario represents a specifc context or environment where multitasking is an integral part of the activities involved.2 For example, one can do sweep floor while doing boil water. Each scenario contains 10 tasks, and some actions and objects are shared across multiple tasks of a scenario. Each task requires multiple actions to be executed, which manipulates the objects in the environment for task completion. In the beginning, TIMEARENA gives a list of tasks to the agent, with a comprehensive task instruction consisting of a task description, an action space, and an object set:\\n\\n\\u2022 Task Description: Introduces task objectives, e.g., Make a dish of beef fried rice, which consists of cooked rice and fried beef. \\u2022 Action Space: Lists the valid actions for the tasks (e.g., chop, wash). Object Set: Lists the available objects in the environment for the tasks (e.g., pot, beaker).\\nAt every timestep $t$ , the agent needs to generate valid actions on the objects and receive feedback from the environment.\\nObjects Objects are integral to completing tasks and situating within the environment. In TIMEARENA, there are 71 different objects for all the tasks. Every task involves a list of objects, which might overlap with other tasks of the same scenario. To mimic the resource limitation in realworld parallel processing, we introduce:\\n\\u2022 Object Occupancy: the state of the object involved in an action is set to be occupied, e.g., wash cup will cause the object cup to be occupied. This object cannot be processed until the involved action is completed (after some time). Then, this object is reset as nonoccupied and waits for another action.\\nActions We design a total of 46 actions for all 30 tasks. Each action consists of a detailed description (e.g., chop OBJ, chop the whole item into sliced pieces.), showing a change of states the action will cause to an object.3 Different from existing text-based simulations (Wang et al., 2022; Gong et al., 2023; Shridhar et al., 2020), in our case, an action has a duration of time and may occupy the agent from performing other actions, to the passage of time. In detail:\\n\\u2022 Action Dependency: An action within the same task might depend on completing other actions within the same task. In Figure 2, make tea is dependent on wash teapot. \\u2022 Duration of Time: Each action holds a timeframe in the timeline, ranging from 1 to 10 minutes. In practice, agents only have an educated guess of the time duration of each action until actually interacting with TIMEARENA. \\u2022 Agent Occupancy: One key to parallel processing is agent occupancy, which prevents agents from performing other tasks. Therefore, we consider two types of actions based on agent occupancy: Type 1 action occupies the agent until completion (e.g., wash teapot), and Type 2 action lets agents be idle, allowing them to perform other actions at the same time (e.g., boil water).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.3 Interaction between Agent and Environment\",\"section_content\":\"Environmental Feedback The feedback from a textual environment is important to simulate and implement the constraints in TIMEARENA using only textual messages. We defne feedback as the response from the environment following an action by an agent. A feedback message could be of multiple types, including:\\n\\u2022 Invalid Action: An action attempt that does not match the required format, e.g., clean teapot is invalid.   \\n\\u2022 Action on Non-existing Object: An action attempt that visits objects that are not in the object set, e.g., pan is non-existent.   \\n\\u2022 Wrong Action Input: An action attempt that the prerequisite action has not been completed (e.g., Cannot perform action add to on object shrimp. Because shrimp is raw.) or has been completed (e.g., wash beaker has been completed).   \\n\\u2022 Action on Mismatched Object: An action attempt that does not match the object, e.g., You cannot perform read on potato.   \\n\\u2022 Action on Occupied Object: An action attempt on occupied objects, e.g., Object pot is being occupied by another action.\\nCorrespondingly, valid actions will trigger environmental feedback of the following types:\\n\\u2022 Action Start: Avoiding previous errors, valid actions will receive a feedback message containing the specifc performing time, marking the start of the action, e.g., You are doing wash cup, it will take 9 minutes.\\n\\n\\u2022 Action Completion: When an action is completed, the environment will send a message, e.g., cup is clean, and reset the occupancy state of the object (cup).\\nProgress Score The progress score, denoted as a percentage, refects the agent\\u2019s completion rate of required actions within the environment, where the total duration for all actions is considered as $100\\\\%$ . Each action\\u2019s contribution to the progress score is proportionate to its duration. Specifcally, if an action\\u2019s duration is $t_{i}$ minutes, its contribution to the progress score is calculated as $\\\\begin{array}{r}{s_{i}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{t_{i}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^{n}t_{j}}\\\\right)\\\\stackrel{\\\\cdot}{\\\\times}100\\\\%}\\\\end{array}$ , with $n$ representing the total number of actions.

In # Task ${}^{=1}$ scenario, agents focus on completing one task (e.g., make tea). For the other two scenarios, we combine either two or three tasks from 10 single tasks (e.g., make tea and wash clothes). Then, we randomly select 10 combined tasks for each scenario.4\\nInteraction Initially, the environment provides a comprehensive task instruction that details the task, action space, and object set. Subsequently, the agent produces an action based on this instruction, adhering to a prescribed format specifed in the action space; any deviation is considered invalid. To facilitate action recognition by the environment, regular expressions are employed to parse actions from responses (e.g., extracting wash clothes from I will wash clothes). For each action execution, the agent must incorporate task instructions, previous actions, and feedback from the environment into LLMs as context.5\\n\\nMaximum Time Each combined task is allocated a maximum completion time. We set the time limit for completing a single task at $40\\\\;\\\\mathrm{min}\\\\cdot$ - utes, which exceeds the total time required for all actions in any given task. For tasks that are combined, the time limit is proportionally increased by the number of tasks involved.\\nOracle Performance As shown in Table 2, Oracle represents the optimal performance, including the shortest completion time and the fastest completion rate, which are manually calculated. Specifically, we calculate oracle performance using a greedy-like strategy: always start the non-occupied actions as early as possible and avoid idleness when there are actions to perform.6\\nFinishing The interaction fnishes under any of the following conditions: 1) Agents have completed all the actions that solve the tasks (i.e., the progress score reaches $100\\\\%$ ); 2) Time has run out; 3) Agents who have performed incorrect actions 5 times in a row are considered to fail the task.\\nModel Choice We employ a diverse set of language models for the agent, including Mistral-7B by MistralAI (Jiang et al., 2023), OpenChat-3.5 fne-tuned from Mistral\\u2019s 7B model (Wang et al., 2023a), Vicuna-13B fne-tuned from LLaMA\\u2019s 13B model with instructions (Chiang et al., 2023), Mixtral- $\\\\mathbf{\\\\nabla}{\\\\cdot}8\\\\mathbf{x}7\\\\mathbf{B}$ , a Mixture-of-Expert version of Mistral (Mistral AI team, 2023), Google\\u2019s Gemini Pro (Team et al., 2023), OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-1106) (OpenAI, 2022), and GPT4 (gpt-4-1106-preview) (OpenAI, 2023). We employ greedy decoding for all the models with the temperature set to 0.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
