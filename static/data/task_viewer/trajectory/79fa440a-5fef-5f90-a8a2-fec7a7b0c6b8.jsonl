{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference.

Compared with DLO (transfer), MVP (transfer) achieves considerably better results under various transfer settings, showing a strong transferability (from $50.36\\\\%$ to $68.78\\\\%$ for TASD).

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development. Top usage scenarios include checking calendar, playing music, and asking about time, etc. We utilized the $10\\\\,\\\\mathrm{hr}$ test set for evaluation.\\nEthical Considerations: We have reviewed all licenses of public datasets, which allow the usage for research and paper publication. The in-house dataset ConvAI is internally approved for research purposes. All datasets are sets are de-identifed to ensure anonymity. We also make sure the datasets cover various English accents, speakers and backgrounds.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We validate our methods on 10 datasets over 4 tasks, including quadruplet tasks, ASQP and ACOS, and triplet tasks, ASTE and TASD.

The dataset consists of original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts. We show examples in Table 1.\\nAlthough it is crucial to choose texts that cover as many periods as possible since vocabulary and grammar change with time, it is diffcult to construct a comprehensive dataset. To our knowledge, Tangshixuan8 (Selection of Tang Poems) is the largest resource containing both original ancient Chinese texts and translated Kanbun texts. We use this resource to make our dataset. For preprocessing, we extract the Japanese reading order from Kanbun by a rule-based program. For the special tokens that may not appear in Kanbun or appear multiple times, we annotated them manually. We also convert the characters from old character forms to new character forms (kind of like transforming Traditional Chinese to Simplifed Chinese, but in Japanese character forms) using dictionaries to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem.\\nTangshixuan contains a total of 465 poems. We split the dataset using group shuffe split to ensure that all sentences in one poem would not be split. Table 2 lists the statistics of the dataset.\\nBased on the dataset, we introduce two tasks, character reordering and machine translation, both of which are signifcant in Kanbun comprehension. For character reordering, the goal is to transform Classical Chinese texts into Japanese reading orders, from SVO to SOV. Japanese reading orders as\\nTable 1: Examples of our dataset.

The character\\u2019s index is added to handle the cases where more than two identical characters appear in one sentence. To make gold labels for training, we normalize the ranks by the lengths of the sentences, making the value of ranks range from 0 to 1 (for a sentence of length 5, the ranks will be normalized from 1, 2, ..., 5 to 0.2, 0.4, ..., 1). Once we collect the output ranks, we sort them in ascending order and restore them to the original characters. Then we obtain a reordered sentence. An illustration of our sorting method is shown in (A) of Figure 2.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Details of Dataset\\nTo train the visual text generation model, we constructed a dataset called TG-2M, which contains rich\\ntextual data. The images in this dataset are sourced from existing open-source datasets, including\\nMARIO-10M [5], Wukong [8], ArT [6], LSVT [27], MLT [16], ReCTS [37], TextSeg [31]. Following\\nAnyText [28], we filter the images with some rules, which can devided into three steps. Specifically,\\nthe filtering rules of the first step include:\\n\\u2022 The images of width smaller than 256 will be filtered out.\\n\\u2022 The images with aspect ratio larger than 2.0 or smaller than 0.5 will be filtered out.\\nAfter step 1, we use PP-OCR5 to detect and recognize the texts in these images. Then, we undergo\\nthe second filtering step:\\n\\u2022 The images with more than 10 texts will be filtered out.\\n\\u2022 The images with more than 3 small texts will be filtered out. The small text refers to\\nhorizontal text with a height of less than 30 pixels or vertical text with a width of less than\\n30 pixels.

We also employ a hybrid\\narchitecture combining Attention and Mamba, along with two auxiliary losses for feature modeling.\\n3\\n3.1\\nProblem formulation\\nGiven HD map and agents in the driving scenario, motion forecasting aims to predict the future\\ntrajectories for the interested agents. The HD map comprises several polylines of lanes or crossings,\\nwhile agents are traffic participants like vehicles and pedestrians. To transform these elements into\\neasily processable and learnable inputs, we utilize a popular vectorized representation following [18].\\nSpecifically, the map M \\u2208RNm\\u00d7L\\u00d7Cm is generated by dividing each line into several shorter\\nsegments, where Nm, L, and Cm denote the number of map polylines, divided segments and feature\\nchannels, respectively. We represent the historical information of agents as A \\u2208RNa\\u00d7Th\\u00d7Ca, where\\nNa, Th, and Ca are the number of agents, historical timestamps, and motion states (e.g., position,\\nheading angle, velocity). Additionally, the future trajectories Af \\u2208RNaoi\\u00d7Tf\\u00d72 for agents of interest\\nare estimation objectives, with Naoi, Tf indicating the number of selected agents and the future\\ntimestamps, respectively.\\n3.2\\nScene context encoding\\nGiven the vectorized representations A for agents and M for HD map, we first employ individual\\nencoders to process them separately. Specifically, we use a PointNet-based polyline encoder, as\\ndescribed in [8, 54, 55], to process the map representation M, generating the map features Fm \\u2208\\nRNm\\u00d7C. For the agents A, we replace generic Transformer [61] or RNN with several Unidirectional\\nMamba [24] blocks, which are more efficient and effective for sequence encoding, to aggregate\\nthe historical trajectory features Fa \\u2208RNa\\u00d7C up to the current time. Subsequently, the scene\\ncontext features Fs \\u2208R(Na+Nm)\\u00d7C are formed by concatenating them and further propagated to a\\nTransformer encoder for intra-interaction learning. The overall process can be formulated as:\\nFm = PointNet(M),\\nFa = UniMamba(A),\\nFs = Transformer(Concat(Fa, Fm)).\\n(1)\\n3.3\\nTrajectory decoding with decoupled queries\\nAfter obtaining the scene context features, we aim to decode multi-modal future trajectories for\\neach interested agent based on our proposed decoupled queries. As illustrated in Figure 2, the\\ndecoder network comprises a State Consistency Module that enhances the consistency and accuracy\\nof dynamic future state queries, a Mode Localization Module for learning distinct motion modes,\\nand a Hybrid Coupling Module to integrate the decoupled queries and generate the final output. The\\ndetailed description of these components are provided in the following.\\nDynamic state consistency.\\nConsidering the recurrence and causality of the future trajectories\\nAf, we propose to represent them as a series of dynamic states across various time steps, distinct\\nyet interconnected. To preserve precise time information, the state queries Qs \\u2208RNaoi\\u00d7Ts\\u00d7C are\\ninitialized with an MLP module for real-time differences. It is notable that the steps Ts can differ from\\nTf to balance the effectiveness and efficiency, especially when predicting long-term future trajectories\\nor a higher frequency of future trajectories. The State Consistency Module is then employed to\\nenhance the consistency of the state queries and aggregate the specific scene context, which can be\\nformulated as follows:\\nQs = MLP([t1, t2, \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 , tTs]),\\nQs = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qs, K = Fs, V = Fs),\\nQs = BiMamba(Qs).\\n(2)\\nSpecifically, cross-attention is first applied to enable state queries to interact with the scene context,\\nfollowed by a Mamba block to model sequence relationships with linear-time complexity. Simultane-\\nously, to account for the influences of rear state queries on the front ones, we adopt the bidirectional\\nMamba [35, 80] for both forward and backward scanning. Additionally, a simple MLP module is\\nutilized to decode the state queries Qs into a single future trajectory for explicit supervision of time\\nconsistency.\\n4\\nDirectional intention localization.\\nMode queries Qm \\u2208RNaoi\\u00d7K\\u00d7C represent different motion\\nmodes, with each query responsible for decoding one of the K trajectories. We utilize the Mode\\nLocalization Module to localize the potential directional intentions, as shown below:\\nQm = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qm, K = Fs, V = Fs),\\nQm = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qm, K = Qm, V = Qm).\\n(3)\\nFor spatial motion learning, two Multi-Head Attention blocks are employed to enable interactions\\namong mode queries and with the scene context. Additionally, we also employ simple MLPs to\\ndecode the future trajectories and probabilities. Similarly, we introduce another auxiliary supervision\\nto endow mode queries with distinct motion intentions.\\nHybrid query coupling.\\nTo incorporate dynamic states and directional intentions, we simply add\\nQm and Qs together to form the hybrid spatiotemporal queries Qh \\u2208RNaoi\\u00d7K\\u00d7Ts\\u00d7C. Then, the\\nHybrid Coupling Module is utilized to further process Qh and yield a comprehensive representation\\nfor future trajectories, as formulated below:\\nQh = MultiHeadAttn(Q = Qh, K = Fs, V = Fs),\\nQh = HybridMultiHeadAttn(Q = Qh, K = Qh, V = Qh),\\nQh = ModeMultiHeadAttn(Q = Qh, K = Qh, V = Qh),\\nQh = BiMamba(Qh).\\n(4)\\nBesides the Attention and Mamba modules for interaction with the scene context, among modes, and\\nacross time states, we additionally introduce a hybrid self-attention layer, which connects queries\\nacross both time and modes, boosting the diversity of predicted trajectories. The change in feature\\ndimensions in this module is shown in Figure 2. The final predictions are generated by decoding the\\noutput Qh into trajectory positions and probabilities with MLPs.\\n3.4\\nTraining losses\\nDeMo is trained with three component losses in an end-to-end manner. Primarily, the regression loss\\nLreg and the classification loss Lcls are employed to supervise the accuracy of predicted trajectories\\nand their associated probability scores. Additionally, we introduce two auxiliary losses, Lts and Lm,\\nfor intermediate features of time states and motion modes, respectively. The former enhances the\\ncoherence and causality of dynamic states across various time steps, while the latter endows mode\\nwith distinct directional intentions. The overall loss L is a combination of these individual losses\\nwith equal weights, formulated as follows:\\nL = Lreg + Lcls + Lts + Lm.\\n(5)\\nWe adopt the cross-entropy loss for probability score classification and the smooth-L1 loss for\\ntrajectory regression tasks. The winner-take-all strategy is employed, optimizing only the best\\nprediction with minimal average prediction error to the ground truth.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

For multi-task settings, we use a different split of the training and development sets in each run.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We frst evaluate the performance of the scoring model by measuring how well it distinguishes the correct and incorrect argument role predictions from an event extraction model. Specifcally, we compute event predictions by running a fully trained event extraction model (i.e., OneIE or AMR-IE) on the validation and test sets of the three benchmark datasets. Based on the gold event annotations, we create a gold binary label (correct or incorrect) for each argument role prediction to indicate its correctness. For each event prediction, we pass it along with the corresponding AMR graph of the source sentence into the scoring model. If the correctness16 predicted by the scoring model agrees with the gold binary label, we treat it as a true prediction for scoring model, otherwise, a false prediction.\\nTo examine the impact of leveraging AMR in scoring model performance, we develop a baseline scoring model that shares the same structure with our proposed scoring model except that it does not take an AMR graph as an input. Specifcally, the baseline scoring model just takes the event mention (triggers, arguments and argument labels) in order to measure the compatibility score. The baseline scoring model is essentially an ablation of our scoring model where the AMR path is absent. As shown in Table 2, the performance of our scoring model outperforms the baseline scoring model by 1.4-1.7 F-score on the test sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graph in characterizing the correctness of each event prediction.\\nIn Table 1, we can observe that the semantics and structure of AMR paths can be easily mapped to argument role types. Sometimes, the even triggers are far from their arguments in plain text, but the AMR paths between them is short and informative. Another observation is that the scoring model tends to assign positive scores to argument roles that are more compatible with the AMR paths, although sometimes the scores for the gold argument roles are not the highest.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 3 shows the event extraction results of both our approach and strong baselines17. For clarity, in the rest of the section, we refer to our proposed framework as STFAMR and our proposed framework with the baseline scoring model as STFW\\/O_AMR. We can see that, both STFAMR and STFW\\/O_AMR improve the performance of the event extraction models on argument role classifcation while the vanilla self-training and GradLRE barely work, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging the feedback to the pseudo labels during selftraining.\\nWe further analyze the reasons in terms of why the vanilla self-training and GradLRE do not work and notice that: due to the data scarcity, the base event extraction model (i.e., OneIE) performs poorly on many argument roles (lower than $40\\\\%$ F-score). Thus, the event predictions on unlabeled corpora can be very noisy and inaccurate. The model suffers from confrmation bias (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017; Arazo et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020): it accumulates errors and diverges when it\\u2019s iteratively trained on such noisy pseudo labeled examples during self-training. In addition, we also notice that with self-training, the event extraction model becomes overconfdent about its predictions. We check the averaged probability of all the argument role predictions on the unlabeled dataset which is 0.93. In such case, it is clear that the predicted probability can not faithfully refect the correctness of the predictions, which is referred as the calibration error (Guo et al., 2017; NiculescuMizil and Caruana, 2005). Thus, the self-training process which relies on overconfdent prediction can become highly biased and diverge from the initial baseline model. In GradLRE, the quality of the reward is highly depend on the averaged gradient direction computed during the supervised training process. However, due to the scarcity of the training data, the stored gradient direction can be unreliable. In addition, the gradient computed on the pseudo-labeled dataset with high reward is used to update the average gradient direction, which can introduce noises into the reward function. As seen in Table 3, the best models of self-training and GradLRE are on par or worse than the baseline approach, and these approaches show the detrimental effects as they show a continuous decline of the performance as training proceeds.\\n\\nBy considering AMR structure, STFAMR encourages the event extraction models to predict event structures that are more compatible with AMR graphs. This claim is supported by Table 4, which compares the compatibility scores between the model without STF (OneIE baseline) and one with STF (OneIE $+{\\\\bf S}\\\\mathrm{TF}$ ) framework on the three benchmark datasets. The compatibility scores are measured by the AMR based scoring models. We can clearly see that the compatibility scores measured on OneIE+STFAMR are much higher than the scores measured on base OneIE.\\nLastly, we observe that OneIE+STFAMR outperforms AMR-IE $^{,+}$ STFAMR, even when AMR-IE performs better than OneIE baseline without STF. We argue the reason is that even though STFAMR does not need AMR parsing at inference time, AMRIE does require AMR graphs at inference time which causes it to suffer from potential errors in the AMR parsing. On the other hand, OneIE trained by STFAMR does not require AMR graphs at inference time, making it free from potential error propagation. Figure 2 shows more examples to illustrate how the feedback from AMR structures in STF helps to improve event predictions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To gain a deeper understanding of cTBLS, we conducted human evaluation using the metrics outlined by Nakamura et al. (2022), namely Coherence, Fluency, and Informativeness. For the evaluation of these metrics, we enlisted crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess $50\\\\%$ of the test data. The evaluation process involved a comparison between the responses generated by HYBRIDIALOGUE and cTBLS Top-3.\\nIn accordance with the methodology delineated in Nakamura et al. (2022), Coherence was defned as the degree to which a response continued the conversation in a logically coherent manner based on prior context. Fluency, conversely, was determined by evaluating absence of grammatical and spelling errors, and appropriate use of parts of speech.\\nTo ensure the quality of the evaluated responses, we engaged crowd workers possessing a Masters qualifcation on AMT and originating from Englishspeaking countries (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Great Britain). Each task required approximately 30 seconds to complete, and workers were remunerated at a rate of $\\\\mathbb{S}0.05$ per task. Moreover, to minimize bias and guarantee the dependability of the evaluations, we assigned two crowd workers to assess each response, with a response deemed more coherent or fuent only if both evaluations concurred.\\nThe results presented in Table 5 reveal that the responses generated by cTBLS Top-3 were more coherent than those produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE in $84.2\\\\%$ of cases and exhibited greater fuency $82.7\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that improvements in table retrieval, knowledge retrieval, and response generation lead to better downstream performance.\\nInformativeness represents the accuracy of machine-generated responses when compared to the ground-truth (Nakamura et al., 2022) and serves as a measure of hallucination in LLMs. Hallucinated responses tend to be less informative, deviating signifcantly from the ground-truth.\\nTo evaluate informativeness, crowd workers determined whether generated responses were semantically equivalent to the ground truth response. Each response was assessed by two Turkers, and a response was deemed more informative only if there was inter-annotator agreement. The absence of illustrative examples in the prompting process resulted in responses generated by cTBLS Top-1 and cTBLS Top-3 being longer than the ground truth response. Consequently, the knowledge-augmented cTBLS responses were considered informative if all the information provided in the ground truth was encapsulated in the model response, even if cTBLS included supplementary information.\\n\\nThe data in Table 6 indicate that cTBLS Top-3 encompasses the same information as the ground truth response $50\\\\%$ of the time, a higher rate than cTBLS Top-1 at $45.6\\\\%$ , exemplifying the benefts of partitioning retrieval into coarse and fne state tracking and augmenting with additional knowledge. Based on these fndings, we hypothesize that the attention mechanism in decoder models facilitates additional knowledge retrieval. cTBLS NoK generates the correct response $30.6\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that HYBRIDIALOGUE comprises questions and answers predicated on general world knowledge embedded in the weights of LLMs. Responses produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE are informative in merely $12.4\\\\%$ of instances.\\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of responses generated by various confgurations of cTBLS on the HYBRIDIALOGUE dataset. The entire dialogue history constitutes the context and is depicted as an exchange between the user (in blue) and the system (in yellow). The fnal question box represents the follow-up query to be addressed, while the last answer chat box indicates the ground truth response. Knowledge K1, K2, and K3 correspond to cells of the table retrieved during state tracking, based on which responses are produced. cTBLS NoK generates a response solely relying on the context, cTBLS Top-1 formulates a response conditioned on K1, and cTBLS Top-3 devises a response based on K1, K2, and K3.\\ncTBLS NoK creates a hallucinated response, answering with the random Faroese club B68 Toftir. Similarly, cTBLS Top-1 hallucinates a response, opting for B36 T\\u00f3rshavn, as K1 refers to the stadium Vi\\u00f2 Marg\\u00e1ir rather than the correct club\\u2019s name. In contrast, cTBLS Top-3 produces the accurate response, EB\\/Streymur, since K3 contains the necessary information. This example demonstrates the benefts of augmenting response generation with additional pertinent knowledge, which aids in mitigating the hallucination problem (Maynez et al., 2020).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Evaluation details\\nE.1\\nSynthetic tasks\\nWe implement our neural process by modifying the Llama 2 architecture [42] to model sequences of\\ncontinuous variables. We replace the tokenizer with a linear layer and the output categorical distribu-\\ntion with a Riemann distribution [7]. We train the model from random initialization on sequences of\\n(x, y) pairs using a standard next token prediction objective and use the AdamW optimizer [84] with\\nlearning_rate = 0.0001, \\u03b21 = 0.9, \\u03b22 = 0.999, \\u03f5 = 1e\\u22128, and weight_decay = 1e\\u221263.

The data generating\\nprocess is described in Appendix F.1.\\nE.2\\nNatural language ICL tasks\\nWe consider tasks defined by six datasets: Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST2) [49]: predict\\nsentiment positive or negative; Subjectivity [50]: predict review subjective or objective; AG News\\n[6]: predict article World, Sports, Business or Sci\\/Tech; Medical QP [51]: predict medical question\\npairs as similar or dissimilar; RTE [52]: predict two sentences as entailment or not entailment; and\\nWNLI [53]: predict sentence with pronoun replaced as entailment or not entailment. We replace\\nthe label Sci\\/Tech with Science for AG News and not entailment with not for RTE and WNLI. We\\nfilter out any queries of length longer than 116 tokens. Full descriptions of these datasets are given in\\nAppendix F.2.\\nTo implement ICL for a given dataset, we sample a response balanced training set of query\\/response\\npairs Dtrain = (xi, yi)n\\n1. Each query in Dtrain is prepended with the string Input: and appended\\nwith a new line . Each response is prepended with the Label: and appended with \\\\n\\\\n. A test query\\nxtest is prepended with the Input: and appended with \\\\nLabel: . These strings are concatenated\\ntogether to form a prompt and we generate a response y from the predictive distribution given by a\\nLlama-2 model p\\u03b8(y | xtest, Dtrain). An example prompt from the Subjectivity dataset is shown in\\nAppendix E.2.\\nFor our experiments in 3.2, we employ LLaMA-2 [42], a family of open source LLMs based on an\\nauto-regressive transformer, pretrained on 2 trillion tokens with a context window of 4,096 tokens.\\nWe run LLaMA-2-7B as an unquantized model (16-bit).\\nTo estimate the predictive distribution over responses, we sample n input\\/label pairs based on the\\ngiven context length, create a prompt based on the context, and generate y samples. An example of a\\nprompt from the Subjectivity dataset is set forth in Figure 7.\\nThe y samples are generated as single tokens, since all labels for our datasets can be identified based\\non their first token. We set the temperature and top_p parameters to 1 to provide the greatest\\npossible diversity and randomness to the label output.\\nFor predictive resampling, we initialize the context by sampling n input\\/label pairs, generate N \\u2212n\\nnew context examples by producing prompts that include the updated context, and produce y samples\\nfrom the cumulative context.

We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6. This task additionally requires dexterous manipulations since the\\nblue box has the be stacked upright and is thus considered to be the\\nmost challenging out of all five tasks. Here, \\u2018X\\u2019 does not refer to the\\ndifficulty but rather to the evaluation protocol: For Stacking-X with\\nX \\u2208{1, 2, 3} we compute the performance metrics of the models that\\nare capable of stacking X blocks. The \\u22481k trajectories were recorded\\nusing augmented reality (AR) such that each stacking order is equally\\noften present.\\n4\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Training Set The training corpora consist of $10{\\\\bf K}+$ hours of paired audio-text data, sampled from both public and in-house datasets. This data regime is representative of a variety of ASR systems used for various speech applications, with a mix of accents, speakers, sampling rates, and background noise. Less than $5\\\\%$ of the data are synthetic audios generated using AWS Polly Text-to-Speech (TTS) 2 neural backend.\\nEvaluation Set We evaluate the proposed MATE approach on both synthetic and real datasets from various domains: MTDialogue (movie-twitter), LibriSpeech (LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) and VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) are in-domain sets, as the training set includes their corresponding train data splits. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993), ConvAI (in-house), SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) datasets are out-of-domain (OOD) datasets for zero-shot evaluation.\\nMTDialogue (movie-twitter) is based on a public lexical dialogue corpus 3 which consists of movie subtitles and twitter user interactions. The audios are generated from TTS system. MTDialogue dataset is a seen dataset for open-book evaluation; i.e., all its data samples are covered in training data. An subset of 1.2 hour is sampled for evaluation. LibriSpeech(LS) (Panayotov et al., 2015) is a read English speech corpus based on LibriVox audiobooks. We consider the two offcial evaluation sets: test-clean and test-other, each with 5.0 hours of test audios. VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) consists of public political speech, sampled from 2009-2020 European Parliament event recordings. For our evaluation purpose, we utilize a 5-hour subset of VoxPopuli English data.\\n\\nWe also evaluate MATE on OOD evaluation sets: ConvAI, WSJ, and SLURP. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (Garofolo et al., 1993) corpus contains conventional and spontaneous dictation by journalists. The test_eval93 split of 0.4 hour is selected for our evaluation. ConvAI is based on in-house user utterances of a task-oriented conversational AI system. The typical usage scenarios include booking fights, ordering food and querying health insurance information, etc. The 2.0 hours of audios are generated from TTS system. SLURP (Bastianelli et al., 2020) is a public dataset for smart home virtual assistant development.

The dataset consists of original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts. We show examples in Table 1.\\nAlthough it is crucial to choose texts that cover as many periods as possible since vocabulary and grammar change with time, it is diffcult to construct a comprehensive dataset. To our knowledge, Tangshixuan8 (Selection of Tang Poems) is the largest resource containing both original ancient Chinese texts and translated Kanbun texts. We use this resource to make our dataset. For preprocessing, we extract the Japanese reading order from Kanbun by a rule-based program. For the special tokens that may not appear in Kanbun or appear multiple times, we annotated them manually. We also convert the characters from old character forms to new character forms (kind of like transforming Traditional Chinese to Simplifed Chinese, but in Japanese character forms) using dictionaries to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem.\\nTangshixuan contains a total of 465 poems. We split the dataset using group shuffe split to ensure that all sentences in one poem would not be split. Table 2 lists the statistics of the dataset.\\nBased on the dataset, we introduce two tasks, character reordering and machine translation, both of which are signifcant in Kanbun comprehension. For character reordering, the goal is to transform Classical Chinese texts into Japanese reading orders, from SVO to SOV. Japanese reading orders as\\nTable 1: Examples of our dataset.

The character\\u2019s index is added to handle the cases where more than two identical characters appear in one sentence. To make gold labels for training, we normalize the ranks by the lengths of the sentences, making the value of ranks range from 0 to 1 (for a sentence of length 5, the ranks will be normalized from 1, 2, ..., 5 to 0.2, 0.4, ..., 1). Once we collect the output ranks, we sort them in ascending order and restore them to the original characters. Then we obtain a reordered sentence.

For multi-task settings, we use a different split of the training and development sets in each run.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We frst evaluate the performance of the scoring model by measuring how well it distinguishes the correct and incorrect argument role predictions from an event extraction model. Specifcally, we compute event predictions by running a fully trained event extraction model (i.e., OneIE or AMR-IE) on the validation and test sets of the three benchmark datasets. Based on the gold event annotations, we create a gold binary label (correct or incorrect) for each argument role prediction to indicate its correctness. For each event prediction, we pass it along with the corresponding AMR graph of the source sentence into the scoring model. If the correctness16 predicted by the scoring model agrees with the gold binary label, we treat it as a true prediction for scoring model, otherwise, a false prediction.\\nTo examine the impact of leveraging AMR in scoring model performance, we develop a baseline scoring model that shares the same structure with our proposed scoring model except that it does not take an AMR graph as an input. Specifcally, the baseline scoring model just takes the event mention (triggers, arguments and argument labels) in order to measure the compatibility score. The baseline scoring model is essentially an ablation of our scoring model where the AMR path is absent. As shown in Table 2, the performance of our scoring model outperforms the baseline scoring model by 1.4-1.7 F-score on the test sets, demonstrating the effectiveness of AMR graph in characterizing the correctness of each event prediction.\\nIn Table 1, we can observe that the semantics and structure of AMR paths can be easily mapped to argument role types. Sometimes, the even triggers are far from their arguments in plain text, but the AMR paths between them is short and informative. Another observation is that the scoring model tends to assign positive scores to argument roles that are more compatible with the AMR paths, although sometimes the scores for the gold argument roles are not the highest.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Table 3 shows the event extraction results of both our approach and strong baselines17. For clarity, in the rest of the section, we refer to our proposed framework as STFAMR and our proposed framework with the baseline scoring model as STFW\\/O_AMR. We can see that, both STFAMR and STFW\\/O_AMR improve the performance of the event extraction models on argument role classifcation while the vanilla self-training and GradLRE barely work, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging the feedback to the pseudo labels during selftraining.\\nWe further analyze the reasons in terms of why the vanilla self-training and GradLRE do not work and notice that: due to the data scarcity, the base event extraction model (i.e., OneIE) performs poorly on many argument roles (lower than $40\\\\%$ F-score). Thus, the event predictions on unlabeled corpora can be very noisy and inaccurate. The model suffers from confrmation bias (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017; Arazo et al., 2020; Pham et al., 2020): it accumulates errors and diverges when it\\u2019s iteratively trained on such noisy pseudo labeled examples during self-training. In addition, we also notice that with self-training, the event extraction model becomes overconfdent about its predictions. We check the averaged probability of all the argument role predictions on the unlabeled dataset which is 0.93. In such case, it is clear that the predicted probability can not faithfully refect the correctness of the predictions, which is referred as the calibration error (Guo et al., 2017; NiculescuMizil and Caruana, 2005). Thus, the self-training process which relies on overconfdent prediction can become highly biased and diverge from the initial baseline model. In GradLRE, the quality of the reward is highly depend on the averaged gradient direction computed during the supervised training process. However, due to the scarcity of the training data, the stored gradient direction can be unreliable. In addition, the gradient computed on the pseudo-labeled dataset with high reward is used to update the average gradient direction, which can introduce noises into the reward function. As seen in Table 3, the best models of self-training and GradLRE are on par or worse than the baseline approach, and these approaches show the detrimental effects as they show a continuous decline of the performance as training proceeds.\\n\\nBy considering AMR structure, STFAMR encourages the event extraction models to predict event structures that are more compatible with AMR graphs. This claim is supported by Table 4, which compares the compatibility scores between the model without STF (OneIE baseline) and one with STF (OneIE $+{\\\\bf S}\\\\mathrm{TF}$ ) framework on the three benchmark datasets. The compatibility scores are measured by the AMR based scoring models. We can clearly see that the compatibility scores measured on OneIE+STFAMR are much higher than the scores measured on base OneIE.\\nLastly, we observe that OneIE+STFAMR outperforms AMR-IE $^{,+}$ STFAMR, even when AMR-IE performs better than OneIE baseline without STF. We argue the reason is that even though STFAMR does not need AMR parsing at inference time, AMRIE does require AMR graphs at inference time which causes it to suffer from potential errors in the AMR parsing. On the other hand, OneIE trained by STFAMR does not require AMR graphs at inference time, making it free from potential error propagation. Figure 2 shows more examples to illustrate how the feedback from AMR structures in STF helps to improve event predictions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"To gain a deeper understanding of cTBLS, we conducted human evaluation using the metrics outlined by Nakamura et al. (2022), namely Coherence, Fluency, and Informativeness. For the evaluation of these metrics, we enlisted crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to assess $50\\\\%$ of the test data. The evaluation process involved a comparison between the responses generated by HYBRIDIALOGUE and cTBLS Top-3.\\nIn accordance with the methodology delineated in Nakamura et al. (2022), Coherence was defned as the degree to which a response continued the conversation in a logically coherent manner based on prior context. Fluency, conversely, was determined by evaluating absence of grammatical and spelling errors, and appropriate use of parts of speech.\\nTo ensure the quality of the evaluated responses, we engaged crowd workers possessing a Masters qualifcation on AMT and originating from Englishspeaking countries (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Great Britain). Each task required approximately 30 seconds to complete, and workers were remunerated at a rate of $\\\\mathbb{S}0.05$ per task. Moreover, to minimize bias and guarantee the dependability of the evaluations, we assigned two crowd workers to assess each response, with a response deemed more coherent or fuent only if both evaluations concurred.\\nThe results presented in Table 5 reveal that the responses generated by cTBLS Top-3 were more coherent than those produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE in $84.2\\\\%$ of cases and exhibited greater fuency $82.7\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that improvements in table retrieval, knowledge retrieval, and response generation lead to better downstream performance.\\nInformativeness represents the accuracy of machine-generated responses when compared to the ground-truth (Nakamura et al., 2022) and serves as a measure of hallucination in LLMs. Hallucinated responses tend to be less informative, deviating signifcantly from the ground-truth.\\nTo evaluate informativeness, crowd workers determined whether generated responses were semantically equivalent to the ground truth response. Each response was assessed by two Turkers, and a response was deemed more informative only if there was inter-annotator agreement. The absence of illustrative examples in the prompting process resulted in responses generated by cTBLS Top-1 and cTBLS Top-3 being longer than the ground truth response. Consequently, the knowledge-augmented cTBLS responses were considered informative if all the information provided in the ground truth was encapsulated in the model response, even if cTBLS included supplementary information.\\n\\nThe data in Table 6 indicate that cTBLS Top-3 encompasses the same information as the ground truth response $50\\\\%$ of the time, a higher rate than cTBLS Top-1 at $45.6\\\\%$ , exemplifying the benefts of partitioning retrieval into coarse and fne state tracking and augmenting with additional knowledge. Based on these fndings, we hypothesize that the attention mechanism in decoder models facilitates additional knowledge retrieval. cTBLS NoK generates the correct response $30.6\\\\%$ of the time, suggesting that HYBRIDIALOGUE comprises questions and answers predicated on general world knowledge embedded in the weights of LLMs. Responses produced by HYBRIDIALOGUE are informative in merely $12.4\\\\%$ of instances.\\nFigure 3 presents a comparison of responses generated by various confgurations of cTBLS on the HYBRIDIALOGUE dataset. The entire dialogue history constitutes the context and is depicted as an exchange between the user (in blue) and the system (in yellow). The fnal question box represents the follow-up query to be addressed, while the last answer chat box indicates the ground truth response. Knowledge K1, K2, and K3 correspond to cells of the table retrieved during state tracking, based on which responses are produced. cTBLS NoK generates a response solely relying on the context, cTBLS Top-1 formulates a response conditioned on K1, and cTBLS Top-3 devises a response based on K1, K2, and K3.\\ncTBLS NoK creates a hallucinated response, answering with the random Faroese club B68 Toftir. Similarly, cTBLS Top-1 hallucinates a response, opting for B36 T\\u00f3rshavn, as K1 refers to the stadium Vi\\u00f2 Marg\\u00e1ir rather than the correct club\\u2019s name. In contrast, cTBLS Top-3 produces the accurate response, EB\\/Streymur, since K3 contains the necessary information. This example demonstrates the benefts of augmenting response generation with additional pertinent knowledge, which aids in mitigating the hallucination problem (Maynez et al., 2020).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Evaluation details\\nE.1\\nSynthetic tasks\\nWe implement our neural process by modifying the Llama 2 architecture [42] to model sequences of\\ncontinuous variables.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"INTRODUCTION\\nIt is well known that a small malicious perturbation, or an adversarial perturbation, can change a\\nclassifier\\u2019s prediction from the correct class to an incorrect class (Szegedy et al., 2014). An inter-\\nesting observation by Ilyas et al. (2019) has shown that a neural network, trained on adversarial\\nexamples labeled by such incorrect classes, can generalize to correctly labeled test samples. Specif-\\nically, the training procedure is as follows:1\\nDefinition 1.1 (Learning from adversarial perturbations (later redefined) (Ilyas et al., 2019)). Let\\nD := {(xn, yn)}N\\nn=1 be a training dataset, where xn denotes an input (e.g., an image) and yn\\ndenotes the corresponding label. Let f be a classifier trained on D. For each n, an adversarial\\nexample xadv\\nn\\nis produced by imposing an adversarial perturbation on xn to increase the probability\\nfor a target label yadv\\nn\\n\\u0338= yn given by f, constructing Dadv := {(xadv\\nn\\n, yadv\\nn\\n)}N\\nn=1. Training a\\nclassifier from scratch on Dadv is called learning from adversarial perturbations.\\nNotably, a training sample xadv appears almost identical to x to humans, but is always labeled\\nas a different class yadv \\u0338= y (e.g., an adversarially perturbed, yet semantically unchanged, horse\\nimage with a cat label). Counterintuitively, networks can learn to classify correctly labeled test\\nsamples (e.g., a cat image with a cat label) from such mislabeled adversarial samples.\\nThe unexpected success of training on mislabeled adversarial examples suggests that adversarial\\nperturbations may contain label-aligned features. For example, frog adversarial images labeled as\\nhorses have perturbations that appear as noises to humans but contain horse features. This feature\\n1This is neither adversarial training nor training with (partially) noisy labels (cf. Appendix A).\\n1\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nhypothesis not only explains the counterintuitive generalization of learning from perturbations, but\\nalso sheds light on several puzzling phenomena of adversarial examples, such as why adversarial\\nexamples can fool classifiers and transfer among them (cf. Section 2).\\nWhile the feature hypothesis is considered a potential explanation for adversarial perturbations, a\\ntheoretical understanding of this hypothesis and its empirical foundation, learning from perturba-\\ntions, remains limited. For example, it is still unknown how adversarial perturbations contain class\\nfeatures. The similarity in decision boundaries between the network trained on clean and mislabeled\\nadversarial samples is also unknown.\\nIn this study, we provide the first theoretical validation of the learnability from adversarial perturba-\\ntions. Using recent results on the decision boundary of a one-hidden-layer neural network trained on\\nmutually orthogonal samples (Frei et al., 2023), we show that perturbations contain sufficient class\\nfeatures for generalization. In addition, we demonstrate that the decision boundary when learn-\\ning from perturbations is consistent with that from natural samples except for specific regions under\\nmild conditions. While Ilyas et al. (2019) empirically considered only the case where L2-constrained\\nperturbations were superimposed on natural data, our theory covers broader settings. We reveal that\\neven sparse perturbations, perturbations of a few pixels, contain class features and enable gener-\\nalization. Moreover, we show that the alignment of decision boundaries derived from adversarial\\nperturbations and natural samples becomes stronger when perturbations are superimposed on ran-\\ndom noises. The main contributions are summarized as follows:\\n\\u2022 We theoretically justified the feature hypothesis and learning from perturbations with one-\\nhidden-layer neural networks trained on mutually orthogonal training samples.\\n\\u2022 We showed that various adversarial perturbations including sparse perturbations can be rep-\\nresented by the weighted sum of benign training samples. This suggests that perturbations,\\nyet apparently uninterpretable, contain sufficient class features for generalization.\\n\\u2022 We demonstrated that classifiers learning from mislabeled adversarial samples produce\\nconsistent predictions with those from clean samples under mild conditions. Moreover,\\nclassifiers trained on random noises with perturbations provide accurate predictions for\\nnatural data even though the classifiers do not see any natural data during training.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"RELATED WORK\\nIlyas et al. (2019) first claimed that an adversarial perturbation contains class features, called non-\\nrobust features. These features are highly predictive and generalizable, yet brittle and incomprehen-\\nsible to humans. This idea is supported by neural networks that learn from perturbations (cf. Def-\\ninition 1.1) achieving good test accuracies on standard datasets (Ilyas et al., 2019). The hypothesis\\nthat perturbations contain features elucidates several phenomena of adversarial examples (Szegedy\\net al., 2014). For example, models misclassify adversarial examples because they react to features in\\nperturbations. Transferability (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015) is also explained: dif-\\nferent models respond to the same features in perturbations. Moreover, adversarially robust models\\nfocus on robust (semantic) features and ignore highly predictive non-robust (non-semantic) features,\\nproviding insights into the trade-off between robustness and accuracy (Su et al., 2018; Tsipras et al.,\\n2019; Raghunathan et al., 2019; 2020; Yang et al., 2020), the human-aligned image gradients of\\nrobust models (Engstrom et al., 2019b; Kaur et al., 2019; Santurkar et al., 2019; Tsipras et al., 2019;\\nAugustin et al., 2020), and the enhanced transfer learning ability of robust models (Aggarwal et al.,\\n2020; Salman et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2021; Utrera et al., 2021).\\nSubsequent studies deepened the discussion of non-robust features. While Ilyas et al. (2019) con-\\nsidered robust and non-robust features separately, Springer et al. (2021b) claimed their potential\\nentanglement. Some studies have attempted to separate robust and non-robust features using the\\ninformation bottleneck (Kim et al., 2021) and neural tangent kernel (Tsilivis & Kempe, 2022). En-\\ngstrom et al. (2019a) provided a broad discussion about robust neural style transfer and feature\\nleakage. Other studies have used the feature hypothesis to generate highly transferable adversarial\\nexamples (Springer et al., 2021a;b;c), understand the behavior of batch normalization in adversar-\\nial training (Benz et al., 2021), and degrade the robustness of adversarially trained models (Tao\\net al., 2022). However, the nature of adversarial perturbations as class features and the theoretical\\nexplanation for the counterintuitive success of learning from perturbations remain unclear.\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nIn this study, we justify learning from perturbations, which is an essential foundation of the fea-\\nture hypothesis. Our results support the above studies based on the feature hypothesis. We do not\\nconsider whether adversarial perturbations are robust or non-robust. We discuss the nature of per-\\nturbations as class features and why classifiers can obtain generalization ability from perturbations.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"CONCLUSION AND LIMITATION\\nWe provided the first theoretical justification for learning from adversarial perturbations for one-\\nhidden-layer networks trained on mutually orthogonal samples. We revealed that various perturba-\\ntions, even sparse perturbations, contain sufficient class features for generalization. Moreover, we\\ndemonstrated that in natural sample and noise data scenarios, networks learning from perturbations\\nproduce decisions consistent with those of normally trained networks, except for specific inputs.\\nOur major limitations are the assumptions of a simple model, i.e., a one-hidden-layer neural net-\\nwork, and orthogonal training samples. In particular, the orthogonality assumptions, Ineqs. (2)\\nand (5), restrict the perturbation constraint \\u03f5 to O(\\np\\nd\\/N). However, in practice, \\u03f5 is typically set to\\nO(\\n\\u221a\\nd). Relaxing these conditions enhances the applicability of our theorems. Nevertheless, our re-\\nsearch provides the first fundamental insight and justification of learning from perturbations, which\\nsupports the feature hypothesis and various puzzling phenomena of adversarial examples.\\n9\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe would like to thank Huishuai Zhang for useful discussions.

Overall, we observe that our proposed approach (row 8) signifcantly outperforms text-only baseline (row 3) on in-domain datasets indicating that audio information helps even when we have suffcient target domain corpus for fne-tuning. Furthermore, results on OOD datasets indicate that MATE generalizes much better to new domains in the complete absence of domain data (zero-shot setting), when compared to the text-only baseline, by utilizing the rich information from audio.\\nMLMs are more effective multi-modal rescorers than autoregressive LMs: Rows 2-5 indicate a signifcant performance gap between BERT and autoregressive rescorers (LAS\\/GPT-2). BERT-Text, which is a text-only baseline, outperforms even the multi-modal GPT2 indicating the root cause of the gap is the lack of bi-directional (left and right) context in GPT2 which is necessary for reliable and effective LLM scoring, hence validating the choice of MLM in MATE.\\n\\nAlignment loss gives signifcant performance boost: To study the effect of alignment loss, we train the multi-modal rescorer with two loss functions: Mean squared error (MSE) loss and contrastive loss. Signifcant performance gains (row 6 vs. row 7-8) in Table 1 indicate that explicit alignment techniques greatly improve learning of multimodal representations. Specifcally, contrastive loss not only aligns relevant pairs like MSE loss, but also promotes distancing irrelevant samples, leading to improved generalization on OOD sets.\\nParameter-effcient fne-tuning results in limited gains: Rows 9-11 study the performance of a multi-modal rescorer under different parameter effcient fne-tuning settings. We observe that performance degrades as we move from full fnetuning to adapter-tuning and freezing the full BERT encoder layers, indicating that fne-tuning BERT encoder is the most benefcial in terms of performance improvement. As expected, in comparison to model with full fne-tuning (row 6), rows 9-11 exhibit lower performance. This suggests that frozen or parameter-effcient training methods may lack the model capacity to fully leverage the acoustic information present in the multi-modal data.\\nMATE is the most effective few-shot learner: To study the effect of few-shot learning, we plot the relative WER reduction (WERR) on Voxpopuli and WSJ datasets across different resource conditions as shown in Figure 2. We observe that MATE transfers well to the new domains in the zero-shot setting with no training or domain data at all. Fewshot performance clearly improves with more examples and goes a reasonable way towards closing the gap from zero-shot performance to full fnetuning performance. We also observe that MATE consistently has superior performance to text-only baseline across both datasets, confrming the ability to rapidly adapt to new domains by leveraging additional information from the audio modality.\\nMATE achieves best zero-shot performance improvement on downstream SLU tasks: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the end goals in a dialog system, we compare it with other baselines using metrics such as scenario\\/action accuracy and entity F1 score in a zeroshot setting on SLURP dataset. From results in Table 2, we observe that MATE consistently outperforms5 the other baselines on end-to-end goals indicating that the improvements are mainly on\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Since each view may predict more than one tuple, we frst aggregate the results of all views and then use the tuples that appear in most views as the fnal prediction.

In comparison with Paraphrase, the single-view method which applies templates with elements in a fxed order, MVP achieves a sizable improvement of $1.89\\\\%$ on average, verifying the effectiveness of multiple informative views.\\n2) Element order-based prompt learning effectively guides the generation of tuples by unifying training and inference.

Compared with LEGO-ABSA, a multi-task unifed baseline, MVP (multi-task) obtains a $+2.82\\\\%$ absolute improvement in F1 score on average.\\nMVP, a single model completing tuple prediction by information from multiple views, can be naturally employed on multiple ABSA tasks, achieving competitive or better performances than previous methods that require task-specifc fne-tuning, data augmentation (e.g., Seq2Path) or complex pretraining (e.g., UIE), either in single-task or multitasking settings, showing strong stability.\"}\n\nIn total, 5 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
