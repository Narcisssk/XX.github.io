{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nConcurrent to our work, methods for training diverse agents with respect to reward have been\\nproposed.\\nIn LIPO [7], they also consider cross-play as a diversity metric, but do not address the critical issue of\\nhandshakes that arise when minimizing cross-play. Their results reinforce our observations when the\\nmixed-play weight, \\u03b2, is set to 0. However, as we have noticed in our Balance Beam simulation results\\nand the Overcooked user study, mixed-play has a large impact on creating good-faith conventions.\\nThe ADVERSITY [8] work considers a zero-shot coordination framework in the game of Hanabi.\\nThey propose a belief reinterpretation model to address a similar \\u201csabotaging\\u201d behavior that we\\nexperienced. This model is designed to tackle the issue of handshakes by finding a plausible\\ndistribution of self-play states that would result in the same observation received from cross-play and\\nuse this while training so agents cannot discriminate between self-play and cross-play observations.\\nHowever, it is unclear whether belief reinterpretation would help in the games we examine in this\\npaper since cross-play can potentially encounter observations that are completely impossible under\\nself-play. Specifically, in Overcooked, all agents have access to the state from the prior frame, but\\nconventions exist as a way to manage the workload of tasks between partners. In Hanabi, a core part\\nof the game is predicting the underlying state of the game given the observation. As such, conventions\\nare based around communicating information about the state implicitly through actions.\\nADVERSITY uses the fact that multiple trajectories can generate the same action-observation history,\\nwhich enables it to gain very strong results in Hanabi. However, this technique would fail in our\\nsettings because there are observations that are only possible under cross-play and not self-play,\\nso belief reinterpretation would not be helpful. Therefore, although ADVERSITY and CoMeDi\\nboth attempt to address the problem of handshakes, their core assumptions are entirely different.\\n24\\nSince CoMeDi does not perform explicit belief reinterpretation, it will not be competitive with\\nADVERSITY on Hanabi, but it would still be able to train a sequence of agents.\\nIn games where implicit communication to predict the underlying state is the core task, ADVERSITY\\nis a strong choice for training a diverse set of agents. However, CoMeDi would be more effective\\nin tasks where a team needs to divide a workload or commit to a particular strategy for effective\\ncoordination. We believe that these scenarios are more similar to the tasks that one would encounter\\nin a robotics domain or typical video game setting.\\nD\"}\n\nIn total, 1 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Discussion\\nWe present NAVSIM, a framework for non-reactive AV simulation. We address shortcomings of\\nexisting driving benchmarks and propose standardized but configurable simulation-based metrics for\\nbenchmarking driving policies. For accessibility, we provide challenging scenario splits and simple\\ndata curation methods. We show that our evaluation protocol is better aligned to closed-loop driving,\\nbenchmark an established set of end-to-end planning baselines from CARLA and nuScenes, and\\npresent the results of our inaugural competition. We hope that NAVSIM can serve as an accessible\\ntoolkit for AV researchers that bridges the gap between simulated and real-world driving.\\nNeed for Reactive Simulation. While we show improvements over displacement errors, several\\naspects of driving remain unaddressed by evaluation in NAVSIM. A high PDMS does not always imply\\na high CLS, since our framework does not consider reactiveness or the compounding accumulation\\n2https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/spaces\\/AGC2024-P\\/e2e-driving-navsim\\n9\\nof errors in closed-loop simulation. Moreover, as in CLS, rear-end collisions into the ego vehicle\\nare currently not classified as \\\"at-fault\\\", resulting in little importance given to the scene behind the\\nvehicle in NAVSIM. In the future, data-driven sensor or traffic simulation could alleviate these issues,\\nonce such methods mature and become computationally tractable. Given these limitations of the\\ncurrent framework, we strongly encourage the use of graphics-based closed-loop simulators, such as\\nCARLA [17], as complementary benchmarks to NAVSIM when developing planning algorithms.\\nSimplicity of Metrics. As a starting point, NAVSIM offers both interpretable open-loop subscores\\nand a scalarizing function, which lets us provide a final score and ranking for participants in the\\nchallenge. In the future, multi-objective evaluation and other aggregation functions might be required.\\nMoreover, closed-loop metrics also face problems, i.e., PDMS inherits several weaknesses of nuPlan\\u2019s\\nCLS. Both scores do not regard certain traffic rules (e.g., stop-sign or traffic light compliance) or\\nconcepts such as transit and fuel efficiency. In the future, we aim to improve the subscore definitions\\n(e.g. the at-fault collision logic) and add more subscores during aggregation.\\nCall for Datasets. Certain limitations of the nuPlan dataset persist in NAVSIM, such as missing\\nclasses in the label space, minor errors in camera parameters, or noise in vehicle poses and 3D\\nannotations. Our analysis might favor methods that are robust to such inconsistencies. In addition,\\nthe lack of road elevation data in our representation presents a challenge for integrating scenarios\\nbased on 3D map annotations. We aim to support more datasets in the future, and advocate for more\\nopen dataset releases by the community for accelerating progress in autonomous driving.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the ERC Starting Grant LEGO-3D (850533), the DFG EXC number\\n2064\\/1 - project number 390727645, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research:\\nT\\u00fcbingen AI Center, FKZ: 01IS18039A and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs\\nand Climate Action within the project NXT GEN AI METHODS.
