{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In this setup, a human\\nexpert controls the robot, e.g., using tele-operation interfaces, and demonstrates solutions to com-\\nplex tasks. Leveraging human expertise, IL algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in\\ntraining robots to perform a wide range of complex tasks with finesse (Brohan et al., 2022; Zhao\\net al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023). However, learning from human data is challenging due to the\\ninherent diversity in human behavior (Grauman et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2020). This diversity,\\narising from factors such as individual preferences, noise, varying levels of expertise, and different\\nproblem-solving approaches, poses a formidable hurdle for existing imitation learning algorithms.\\nIn recent years, there has been a notable surge of interest in the development of methods aimed at\\ncapturing diverse behaviors (Shafiullah et al., 2022; Chi et al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023). These\\nendeavors are driven by various objectives, including improving generalization capabilities (Merel\\net al., 2018; Li et al., 2017), enhancing skill transfer between policies (Merel et al., 2018; Kumar\\net al., 2020), and gaining advantages in competitive games (Celik et al., 2022), among others.

Other datasets are collected directly on\\nreal robot platforms and lack simulation environments that can be used for benchmarking other al-\\ngorithms. While real robot environments are of course preferable to show the applicability of the\\napproaches on the real system, they hinder benchmarking new algorithms against the reported re-\\nsults as that would require rebuilding the real robot setup, which is often infeasible. Furthermore,\\nthe majority of existing studies do not provide metrics to quantitatively measure a model\\u2019s ability to\\nreplicate diverse behaviors, often relying solely on qualitative analysis (Shafiullah et al., 2022).\\nTo address these challenges, this work introduces benchmark environments and the corresponding\\nDatasets with Diverse Human Demonstrations for Imitation Learning (D3IL). Our primary aim is\\nto provide a comprehensive evaluation framework that explicitly assesses an algorithm\\u2019s ability to\\nlearn from multi-modal data distributions. We have designed these datasets to encompass the rich-\\nness and variability inherent in human behavior, offering more realistic and challenging benchmark\\nscenarios for imitation learning.

Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of the distinctive fea-\\ntures that set our work apart from the most closely related benchmarks in the field.\\nRLBench (James et al., 2020) and ManiSkill2 (Mu et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2023) are two recent\\nlarge-scale benchmarks for robot learning with a large variety of tasks with both, proprioceptive\\nand visual data. However, the demonstrations are generated through motion planning and are hence\\nlacking diversity. Meta-World is another robot learning benchmark with 50 different tasks and a\\nfocus on multi-task reinforcement learning (Yu et al., 2020). Yet, no human demonstrations exists\\nfor these tasks and most tasks typically only have one solution. D4RL (Fu et al., 2020) proposed\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nstandardized environments and datasets for offline reinforcement learning with various tasks. Sev-\\neral other benchmarks specialize in areas such as language-guided multitask learning in simulation\\n(Mees et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2023; Gong et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2023; Gong\\net al., 2023), continual learning (Liu et al., 2023) and diverse multi-task real world skill learning\\n(Walke et al., 2023; Bharadhwaj et al., 2023; Heo et al., 2023). A benchmark with a focus on human\\ndemonstrations is Robomimic (Mandlekar et al., 2021), featuring 8 different task in simulation and\\nreal world environments. The demonstrations, collected by multiple people with various degrees of\\nexpertise using the RoboTurk framework (Mandlekar et al., 2018). Yet, the tasks where not designed\\nto show diverse behavior and consequently, non of the tested algorithms was designed to capture the\\ndiversity of the behavior.\\nThe benchmarks most closely related to D3IL are Block-Push (Florence et al., 2022; Shafiullah\\net al., 2022), T-Shape Pushing (Florence et al., 2022) and Relay Kitchen Gupta et al. (2019). While\\nBlock-Push has 4 different modalities, the behavior is generated by a scripted policy and is hence\\nlacking variance and fall-back solutions in the dataset. T-Shape tasks are limited to a maximum of\\ntwo modalities. The Relay Kitchen environment (Gupta et al., 2019) contains 7 different tasks with\\nhuman demonstrations that solve four tasks in sequence but does not require closed-loop sensory\\nfeedback. Further, several recent work have shown to achieve nearly optimal performance (Chi\\net al., 2023; Reuss et al., 2023) on these benchmarks, limiting further progress in these environments.\\nMoreover, none of the mentioned benchmarks offer metrics to evaluate the diversity of the learned\\nbehavior.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Datasets with Diverse Demonstrations for Imitation Learning\",\"section_content\":\"DATASETS WITH DIVERSE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR IMITATION LEARNING\\nIn this section, we present a novel suite of tasks known as D3IL - Datasets with Diverse Demon-\\nstrations for Imitation Learning. We first introduce metrics for the quantification of diverse behavior\\n(refer to Section 3.1). Subsequently, we delve into the design principles underlying our tasks, which\\nare subsequently introduced at the end of this section.\\n3.1\\nQUANTIFYING DIVERSE BEHAVIOR\\nLet D = {(an, sn)}N\\nn=1 be a human-recorded demonstration dataset with actions a \\u2208A and states\\ns \\u2208S. Further, let p(a|s) be the underlying state-conditional action distribution. The goal of\\nimitation learning is to learn a policy \\u03c0(a|s) \\u2248p(a|s). Diversity is characterized by a multimodal\\naction distribution p(a|s), meaning that there are multiple distinct actions that are likely for a given\\nstate s. We refer to this as multimodality on a state-level. However, this multimodality is hard to\\nquantify in most scenarios as we do not have access to p(a|s). Instead, we look at the multimodality\\non a behavior-level to define an auxiliary metric that reflects if a model is capable of imitating diverse\\nbehaviors. To define behavior-level multi-modality, we introduce discrete behavior descriptors \\u03b2 \\u2208\\nB, for example, which box has been chosen to be pushed first. The space B of behavior descriptors\\nare thus task-specific and are discussed in Section 3.3.\\nTo evaluate the ability of a trained policy \\u03c0(a|s) to capture multi-modality, we collected data such\\nthat we have an approximately equal number of demonstrations for each behavior descriptor \\u03b2 \\u2208B.\\nThereafter, we perform simulations in the task environment to compute the agents\\u2019 distribution \\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\nover its achieved behaviors. We then assess the policy\\u2019s capability of learning diverse behavior by\\nleveraging the behavior entropy, that is,\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n= \\u2212\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2).\\n(1)\\nPlease note that we employ the logarithm with a base of |B| to ensure that H\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2)\\n\\u0001\\n\\u2208[0, 1].\\nThis choice of base facilitates a straightforward interpretation of the metric: An entropy value of 0\\nsignifies a policy that consistently executes the same behavior, while an entropy value of 1 represents\\na diverse policy that executes all behaviors with equal probability, that is, \\u03c0(\\u03b2) \\u22481\\/|B| and hence\\nmatches the true behavior distribution by the design of the data collection process. Yet, a high\\nbehavior entropy can also be achieved by following different behaviors in different initial states in a\\ndeterministic manner, and hence, this behavior entropy can be a poor metric for behavior diversity.\\nHence, we evaluate the expected entropy of the behavior conditioned on the initial state s0. If, for\\nthe same initial state, all behaviors can be achieved, the conditional behavior entropy is high, while\\n3\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nif for the same initial state always the same behavior is executed, this entropy is 0. We define the\\nconditional behavior entropy as\\nEs0\\u223cp(s0)\\n\\u0002\\nH\\n\\u0000\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0)\\n\\u0001\\u0003\\n\\u2248\\u22121\\nS0\\nX\\ns0\\u223cp(s0)\\nX\\n\\u03b2\\u2208B\\n\\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0) log|B| \\u03c0(\\u03b2|s0),\\n(2)\\nwhere the expectation is approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate. Here, S0 denotes the number\\nof samples from the initial state distribution p(s0).\\n3.2\\nTASK DESIGN PRINCIPLES\\nWe build D3IL based on the following key principles: i) Diverse Behavior. Diversity is the central\\naspect of our task design. We intentionally design our tasks to encompass multiple viable approaches\\nto successful task completion. To quantify the behavior diversity, we explicitly specify these dis-\\ntinct behaviors, each representing a legitimate solution. ii.) Multiple Human Demonstrators. To\\nreflect the natural variability in human behavior and to obtain a richer dataset, we have collected\\ndemonstration data from multiple human demonstrators. This diversity in data sources introduces\\nvariations in the quality and style of demonstrations. iii.) Variable Trajectory Lengths. Our tasks\\nincorporate variable trajectory lengths, replicating real-world scenarios where demonstrations may\\ndiffer in duration. This design choice challenges our learning agents to handle non-uniform data se-\\nquences effectively. By accommodating varying trajectory lengths, our approach must learn to adapt\\nand generalize to different time horizons, a critical property for real-world applications. iv.) Task\\nVariations and Closed-Loop Feedback. For most tasks, agents need to rely on sensory feedback\\nto achieve a good performance which considerably increases the complexity of the learning task\\nin comparison to learning open-loop trajectories. We achieve this by introducing task variations in\\nevery execution. For example, in every execution, the initial position of the objects will be different\\nand the agent needs to adapt its behaviour accordingly.\\n3.3\\nTASK DESCRIPTION AND DATA COLLECTION\\nWe simulate all tasks (T1-T5) using the Mujoco physics engine (Todorov et al. (2012)). The simula-\\ntion environment consists of a 7DoF Franka Emika Panda robot and various objects. For T1-T4, the\\nrobot is equipped with a cylindrical end effector to perform object manipulations. The corresponding\\ndemonstrations are recorded by using an Xbox game-pad which sends commands to an inverse kine-\\nmatics (IK) controller. In T5, the robot has a parallel gripper and uses an augmented reality setup\\nfor controlling the end effector (Jiang et al., 2024), allowing for more dexterous manipulations.\\nAvoiding (T1). The Avoiding task requires the robot to reach the green\\nfinish line from a fixed initial position without colliding with one of\\nthe six obstacles. The task does not require object manipulation and\\nis designed to test a model\\u2019s ability to capture diversity. There are\\n24 different ways of successfully completing the task and thus |B| =\\n24. The dataset contains 96 demonstrations in total, comprising 24\\nsolutions with 4 trajectories for each solution.\\nAligning (T2). The Aligning task requires the robot to push a hollow\\nbox to a predefined target position and orientation. The task can be\\ncompleted by either pushing the box from outside or inside and thus\\n|B| = 2. It requires less diversity than T1 but involves complex object\\nmanipulation. The dataset contains 1k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial states.\\n4\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nPushing (T3). This task requires the robot to push two blocks to fixed\\ntarget zones. Having two blocks and two target zones results in |B| = 4\\nbehaviors. The task has more diversity than T2 and involves complex\\nobject manipulations. Additionally, the task has high variation in tra-\\njectory length caused by multiple human demonstrators with different\\nexperience levels. The dataset contains 2k demonstrations, 500 for each\\nbehavior with uniformly sampled initial block positions.\\nSorting-X (T4). This task requires the robot to sort red and blue blocks\\nto their color-matching target box. The \\u2018X\\u2019 refers to the number of\\nblocks. In this work, we test three difficulty levels, i.e., X \\u2208{2, 4, 6}.\\nThe number of behaviors |B| is determined by the sorting order. For\\nX = 6, the task has many objects, is highly diverse (|B| = 20), re-\\nquires complex manipulations, has high variation in trajectory length,\\nand is thus more challenging than T1-T3. The dataset contains 1.6k\\ndemonstrations for X = 6 and an approximately equal number of tra-\\njectories for each sorting order.\\nStacking-X (T5). This task requires the robot to stack blocks with\\ndifferent colors in a (yellow) target zone. The number of behaviors |B|\\nis given by the stacking order. Having three different blocks results\\nin six different combinations for stacking the blocks and hence |B| =\\n6.

Yet, working with data remains time-consuming and painful due\\nto a wide variety of data formats, the lack of interoperability between tools, and the dif\\ufb01culty of\\ndiscovering and combining datasets [28, 34]. Data\\u2019s prominent role in ML also leads to questions\\nabout its responsible use for training and evaluating ML models in areas such as licensing, privacy, or\\nfairness, among others [39]. New approaches are needed to make datasets easier to work with, while\\nalso addressing concerns around their responsible use.\\nThis paper1 presents Croissant, a metadata format designed to improve ML datasets\\u2019 discoverability,\\nportability, reproducibility, and interoperability. Croissant makes datasets \\u201cML-ready\\u201d by recording\\nML-speci\\ufb01c metadata that enables them to be loaded directly into ML frameworks and tools (see\\nFigure 2 for sample code). Croissant describes datasets\\u2019 attributes, the resources they contain, and\\ntheir structure and semantics. This uniform description streamlines their usage and sharing within\\nthe ML community and between ML platforms and tools while fostering responsible ML practices.\\nFigure 1 gives an overview of the Croissant lifecycle and ecosystem.\\nCroissant can describe most types of data commonly used in ML work\\ufb02ows, such as images,\\ntext, audio, or tabular.

We analyzed the consistency\\nof their responses and collected their\\nfeedback on Croissant.\\nThe remainder of the paper is struc-\\ntured as follows: in Section 2 we con-\\ntextualize related work. In Section 3\\nwe describe the Croissant format, its\\nintegrations, and the tools that support\\nit. Section 4 comprises the user study\\nand discusses its results and limita-\\ntions.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Related Work\\nWhile there have been many prior ef-\\nforts in standardizing dataset meta-\\ndata, they typically lack ML-speci\\ufb01c support, do not work with existing ML tools, or lag behind the\\ndemands of dynamically evolving requirements, such as responsible ML. We outline the state of the\\n\\ufb01eld below.\\nVocabularies for Dataset Documentation. Dataset documentation is indispensable for effective\\ndata management and serves as a foundational element for training and evaluating ML models [16].\\nMetadata descriptions of datasets enhance their discoverability, interoperability, and usability, which\\nis critical for advancing research and data-driven applications. Ontologies and vocabularies are\\nsemantic web tools used to standardize dataset documentation. While vocabularies comprise sets of\\nterms and their meanings to describe data consistently, ontologies provide a structured framework\\nto de\\ufb01ne and relate these concepts within a domain. Ontologies and vocabularies are evaluated for\\ntheir coverage (i.e., do they represent all relevant concepts), accuracy (correctness of de\\ufb01nitions and\\nrelationships), consistency (no logical contradictions), and usability (ease of use and integration).\\nThis is done through methods like competency questions, expert validation, and use-case testing [46].\\nStandards for Catalogs and Metadata. With the increase of data availability online, various efforts\\nhave focused on making data both discoverable and user-friendly by supplementing datasets with\\ncomprehensive metadata. This metadata may include details about the dataset, such as authorship,\\nformat, and intended use, all structured consistently to support automated processing and retrieval.\\nKey efforts towards documentation have led to the creation of standards like the Data Catalog Vocabu-\\nlary (DCAT) [9] and the Dataset vocabulary in schema.org [40]. DCAT facilitates interoperability\\namong web-based data catalogs, enabling users to aggregate, classify, and \\ufb01lter datasets ef\\ufb01ciently.\\nSchema.org [19] acts as a de facto standard for metadata, helping search engines discover and index\\npublished web content, including datasets, thus enhancing dataset accessibility and understandability.\\nThis versatility allows schema.org to describe a wide array of content types effectively. Other\\nframeworks, such as Data Packages [2] and CSV on the Web [1] support methods for describing\\nand exchanging tabular data. The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health\\u2019s Data Use Ontology\\n(DUO) [29] re\\ufb01nes data usage terms with optional modi\\ufb01ers, improving clarity in genomic data\\nsharing agreements. Efforts towards integration of FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Inter-\\noperability, and Reusability) [45] in metadata vocabularies are also noteworthy. Despite their utility\\nfor speci\\ufb01c domains and formats, these standards do not entirely meet the specialized needs of data\\nmanagement within the ML domain. In this context, the compliance of ML-ready datasets with\\nthe FAIR principles is a primary need for improving discoverability, portability and reproducibility\\nin the ML ecosystem. The adoption of standard metadata description practices across the broader\\ncommunity further enhances the interoperability of ML datasets from diverse domains.\\n2\\n1 # 1.

Data-centric ML [34, 25] is increasingly\\nseen as critical to the development of trustworthy ML systems, including aspects such as fairness,\\naccountability, transparency, data privacy and governance, safety, and robustness [41]. Seminal works,\\nsuch as Datasheets for Datasets [16] and Data Statements [11], have emphasized the importance of\\ndataset documentation to assess and increase the trustworthiness of ML systems. Several related\\ndocumentation efforts such as Data Cards [38] and Data Nutrition Labels [23] have been inspired\\nthem. ML data repositories, such as Kaggle [6], OpenML [44] and Hugging Face [5], have initiated\\ntheir own metadata documentation efforts. Hugging Face, for example, provides Dataset Cards [4]\\nthat include summaries, \\ufb01elds, splits, potential social impacts, and biases inherent in the datasets.\\nThese approaches typically rely on data documentation written in natural language, without a standard\\nmachine-readable representation, which makes data documentation challenging for machines to read\\nand process. Croissant \\ufb01lls this gap by providing a standardized framework for data documentation\\nthat ensures semantic consistency and machine readability, thereby facilitating seamless integration\\nwith existing tools and frameworks used by the ML community.\\n3\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
