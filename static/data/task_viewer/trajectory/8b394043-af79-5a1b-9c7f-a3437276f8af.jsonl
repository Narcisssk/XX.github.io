{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

(2023) Liu\\net al. (2020) Xu et al. (2020) Xu et al. (2024). The learning algorithm of SNNs is vital to their\\nperformance and application, which are mainly divided into two categories: local learning Hebb\\n(2005) Song et al. (2000) Lu & Sengupta (2023) and global learning Zenke & Ganguli (2018) Wu\\net al. (2018). Local learning is a correlation-driven learning method, suitable for sparse networks\\nand low-power hardware but difficult to handle complex tasks and deep networks. Global learning is\\na loss-driven learning method, suitable for dense networks to solve complex tasks, but requires a lot\\nof computational energy consumption. Therefore, integrating local and global learning so that the\\nlearning algorithm has both the energy-saving advantages of local learning and the high-performance\\nadvantages of global learning is a significant research interest in the field of SNN.\\nThe biological three-factor learning rules Gerstner et al. (2018) Bailey et al. (2000) provide biologi-\\ncal insights for the new way of integrating local and global learning. The three-factor rule is that the\\nadjustment of synaptic weights depends not only on the activity of the pre-synaptic neuron and the\\npost-synaptic neuron but also on a third factor (e.g., neurotransmitter). Wu et al. (2022) also pro-\\nposed a hybrid synergic learning algorithm, which uses two sets of weights to update the weights of\\nlocal learning and global learning separately and then directly adds the two sets of weights, achiev-\\ning comparable performance.

Moreover, the type of hybrid learning algorithms still needs more reasonable biolog-\\nical plausibility. Hence, the current hybrid learning algorithms have some theoretical and practical\\nshortcomings and need further improvement and optimization via the excitation-inhibition mecha-\\nnism.\\nIn this paper, we propose an Excitation-Inhibition Mechanism assisted hybrid Learning(EIHL) al-\\ngorithm. Inspired by the excitation-inhibition mechanism of biological neural networks Rosenberg\\net al. (2023) Sadeh & Clopath (2021) Wang et al. (2022) Xue et al.

When the neural network is in an over-excited\\nstate, it switches to an inhibited state. When the neural network is in an over-inhibited state, it\\nswitches to an excited state. Based on the dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition in the neural\\nnetwork, we achieve dynamic switching between global learning and local learning.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\\n\\u2022 We propose an excitation-inhibition mechanism-assisted hybrid learning(called EIHL),\\nwhich can combine the high accuracy of global learning and the low energy consump-\\ntion of local learning and showed excellent accuracy and sparsity in the experiments on\\nthree datasets and two models.\\n\\u2022 We obtained inspiration from neuroscience and adopted the excitation-inhibition mecha-\\nnism to solve the problem of how to reasonably integrate hybrid learning.

Based on these rules, spike-timing dependent plasticity\\n(STDP) was proposed by Song et al. (2000). STDP is a local learning algorithm that adjusts synaptic\\nweights based on the pulse timing interval between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Deep-\\nSTDP Lu & Sengupta (2023) is a local learning algorithm based on STDP, which uses pseudo-labels\\nobtained through clustering for loss backpropagation and updating of synaptic weights, significantly\\nimproving performance. However, Deep-STDP also increases computational complexity and energy\\nconsumption.\\nGlobal learning: The Backpropagation (BP) BP (1990) algorithm performs well in artificial neural\\nnetworks (ANNs) Agatonovic-Kustrin & Beresford (2000), but cannot be directly applied to spiking\\nneural networks (SNNs) Maass (1997). So, the SuperSpike Zenke & Ganguli (2018) algorithm em-\\nploys a gradient approximation method but does not consider the unique spatiotemporal information\\nof SNNs. The Spatio-Temporal Backpropagation (STBP) Wu et al. (2018) algorithm compensates\\nfor the insufficient SuperSpike algorithm. STBP is a modified variant of the backpropagation al-\\ngorithm specifically designed for training SNNs. STBP considers the temporal relationships and\\nconnectivity between spiking neurons, emphasizing the temporal nature of spikes. While STBP\\nperforms excellently in task recognition accuracy, it also brings greater computational complexity.\\nIn practice, Wu et al. (2022)proposed hybrid plasticity (HP), which uses two sets of weights to\\nupdate local and global learning weights, respectively. This hybrid learning method integrates local\\nand global learning, resulting in higher accuracy. HP inspired our method to fuse local and global\\nlearning from the weights perspective. In biology, the three-factor learning rules Gerstner et al.\\n(2018) Bailey et al.

The solid lines represent the\\nconnections that exist, and the dashed lines represent the connections that are broken. In global\\nlearning, the LTP effect of excitation is synaptic enhancement, which makes the neurons in the net-\\nwork more active to fire spikes. In local learning, the LTD effect of inhibition is synaptic shrinkage\\nor even disconnection, which makes the neurons in the network more passive to fire spikes.\\nFirst of all, the challenge of hybrid learning lies in the integration of global and local learning.\\nWhile current hybrid learning methods have achieved excellent results in terms of accuracy Wu\\net al. (2022), they could do slightly better in integrating the low energy consumption advantage\\nof local learning. Therefore, based on the exciting Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) Malenka et al.\\n(1999a) results of global learning and the inhibitory Long-Term Depression (LTD) Ito (1989) results\\nof local learning, an excitatory-inhibitory mechanism is adopted to balance the two.

Finally, according to the excitatory-inhibitory mechanism, excitation and inhibition\\nare automatically balanced. As shown in Fig. 1. when the network is overly excited, it should be\\ninhibited, and when it is in an overly inhibited state, it should be excited. We propose an Excitatory-\\nInhibitory Hybrid Learning (EIHL) method, which better integrates the advantages of local and\\nglobal learning, resulting in a model with high accuracy and low power consumption.

(2023) Liu\\net al. (2020) Xu et al. (2020) Xu et al. (2024). The learning algorithm of SNNs is vital to their\\nperformance and application, which are mainly divided into two categories: local learning Hebb\\n(2005) Song et al. (2000) Lu & Sengupta (2023) and global learning Zenke & Ganguli (2018) Wu\\net al. (2018). Local learning is a correlation-driven learning method, suitable for sparse networks\\nand low-power hardware but difficult to handle complex tasks and deep networks. Global learning is\\na loss-driven learning method, suitable for dense networks to solve complex tasks, but requires a lot\\nof computational energy consumption. Therefore, integrating local and global learning so that the\\nlearning algorithm has both the energy-saving advantages of local learning and the high-performance\\nadvantages of global learning is a significant research interest in the field of SNN.\\nThe biological three-factor learning rules Gerstner et al. (2018) Bailey et al. (2000) provide biologi-\\ncal insights for the new way of integrating local and global learning. The three-factor rule is that the\\nadjustment of synaptic weights depends not only on the activity of the pre-synaptic neuron and the\\npost-synaptic neuron but also on a third factor (e.g., neurotransmitter). Wu et al. (2022) also pro-\\nposed a hybrid synergic learning algorithm, which uses two sets of weights to update the weights of\\nlocal learning and global learning separately and then directly adds the two sets of weights, achiev-\\ning comparable performance. However, the current hybrid learning algorithm needs to trade-off\\nbetween the accuracy advantage of global learning and the low energy consumption advantage of\\n\\u2217Corresponding author: Qi Xu, xuqi@dlut.edu.cn\\n1\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nlocal learning. Moreover, the type of hybrid learning algorithms still needs more reasonable biolog-\\nical plausibility. Hence, the current hybrid learning algorithms have some theoretical and practical\\nshortcomings and need further improvement and optimization via the excitation-inhibition mecha-\\nnism.\\nIn this paper, we propose an Excitation-Inhibition Mechanism assisted hybrid Learning(EIHL) al-\\ngorithm. Inspired by the excitation-inhibition mechanism of biological neural networks Rosenberg\\net al. (2023) Sadeh & Clopath (2021) Wang et al. (2022) Xue et al. (2014) Shea (2021) Simeone &\\nRho (2009) Wang (2020), We choose to distinguish between excitation and inhibition states accord-\\ning to the overall connection state of the network. When the neural network is in an over-excited\\nstate, it switches to an inhibited state. When the neural network is in an over-inhibited state, it\\nswitches to an excited state. Based on the dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition in the neural\\nnetwork, we achieve dynamic switching between global learning and local learning.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\\n\\u2022 We propose an excitation-inhibition mechanism-assisted hybrid learning(called EIHL),\\nwhich can combine the high accuracy of global learning and the low energy consump-\\ntion of local learning and showed excellent accuracy and sparsity in the experiments on\\nthree datasets and two models.\\n\\u2022 We obtained inspiration from neuroscience and adopted the excitation-inhibition mecha-\\nnism to solve the problem of how to reasonably integrate hybrid learning. The experimen-\\ntal results showed that EIHL also achieved sparsity advantages, which made it possible to\\ndeploy on hardware.\\n\\u2022 We used the neural excitation-inhibition mechanism to achieve the integration of global and\\nlocal learning and implemented it by adjusting the weights. This not only provides a new\\nperspective for the field of SNN training methods but also prepares for the generalization\\nof EIHL to the ANN domain.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"RELATED WORKS\\n2.1\\nLEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS\\nLocal learning: The Hebb learning rule Hebb (2005) states that the pre-synaptic neuron must be\\nactivated before the post-synaptic neuron. Based on these rules, spike-timing dependent plasticity\\n(STDP) was proposed by Song et al. (2000). STDP is a local learning algorithm that adjusts synaptic\\nweights based on the pulse timing interval between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Deep-\\nSTDP Lu & Sengupta (2023) is a local learning algorithm based on STDP, which uses pseudo-labels\\nobtained through clustering for loss backpropagation and updating of synaptic weights, significantly\\nimproving performance. However, Deep-STDP also increases computational complexity and energy\\nconsumption.\\nGlobal learning: The Backpropagation (BP) BP (1990) algorithm performs well in artificial neural\\nnetworks (ANNs) Agatonovic-Kustrin & Beresford (2000), but cannot be directly applied to spiking\\nneural networks (SNNs) Maass (1997). So, the SuperSpike Zenke & Ganguli (2018) algorithm em-\\nploys a gradient approximation method but does not consider the unique spatiotemporal information\\nof SNNs. The Spatio-Temporal Backpropagation (STBP) Wu et al. (2018) algorithm compensates\\nfor the insufficient SuperSpike algorithm. STBP is a modified variant of the backpropagation al-\\ngorithm specifically designed for training SNNs. STBP considers the temporal relationships and\\nconnectivity between spiking neurons, emphasizing the temporal nature of spikes. While STBP\\nperforms excellently in task recognition accuracy, it also brings greater computational complexity.\\nIn practice, Wu et al. (2022)proposed hybrid plasticity (HP), which uses two sets of weights to\\nupdate local and global learning weights, respectively. This hybrid learning method integrates local\\nand global learning, resulting in higher accuracy. HP inspired our method to fuse local and global\\nlearning from the weights perspective. In biology, the three-factor learning rules Gerstner et al.\\n(2018) Bailey et al. (2000) indicate that another factor affects synaptic strength besides the activity\\nbetween presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, such as neurotransmitters.\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n2.2\\nEXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY MECHANISMS IN NEURAL SYSTEMS\\nNeuronal excitation and inhibition mechanisms have pathological and functional significance Rosen-\\nberg et al.

From a pathological\\nperspective, excitation-inhibition not only regulates the emotions of impulse or hesitation but also\\ninduces or reduces the frequency and duration of epileptic seizures, as well as improves cognitive\\nand memory functions Rosenberg et al. (2023). From a functional perspective, networks with exci-\\ntation and inhibition have stronger learning abilities than networks with only excitation, as shown\\nby Wang et al. (2022) who set positive weights as excitation and negative weights as inhibition in\\nan ANN with a monotonic activation function. They proved that networks with only excitation can\\nachieve monotonic functions and can not implement the XOR function.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Preliminary\",\"section_content\":\"PRELIMINARY\\n3.1\\nINTEGRATE-AND-FIRE MODEL\\nThis paper uses the integrate-and-fire (IF) model as a single computational unit in SNNs, which is\\na biological neuron model that describes how neurons produce action potentials.

The solid lines represent the\\nconnections that exist, and the dashed lines represent the connections that are broken. In global\\nlearning, the LTP effect of excitation is synaptic enhancement, which makes the neurons in the net-\\nwork more active to fire spikes. In local learning, the LTD effect of inhibition is synaptic shrinkage\\nor even disconnection, which makes the neurons in the network more passive to fire spikes.\\nFirst of all, the challenge of hybrid learning lies in the integration of global and local learning.\\nWhile current hybrid learning methods have achieved excellent results in terms of accuracy Wu\\net al. (2022), they could do slightly better in integrating the low energy consumption advantage\\nof local learning. Therefore, based on the exciting Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) Malenka et al.\\n(1999a) results of global learning and the inhibitory Long-Term Depression (LTD) Ito (1989) results\\nof local learning, an excitatory-inhibitory mechanism is adopted to balance the two. Secondly, in\\nthe cerebral cortex, the excitatory mechanism can enhance synaptic strength Malenka et al. (1999b),\\nwhile the inhibitory mechanism can weaken it Abraham & Bear (1996) Li et al. (2017b). Unlike\\nprevious works Kern & Chao (2023) Zhu et al.

Finally, according to the excitatory-inhibitory mechanism, excitation and inhibition\\nare automatically balanced. As shown in Fig. 1. when the network is overly excited, it should be\\ninhibited, and when it is in an overly inhibited state, it should be excited.

(2023) Liu\\net al. (2020) Xu et al. (2020) Xu et al. (2024). The learning algorithm of SNNs is vital to their\\nperformance and application, which are mainly divided into two categories: local learning Hebb\\n(2005) Song et al. (2000) Lu & Sengupta (2023) and global learning Zenke & Ganguli (2018) Wu\\net al. (2018). Local learning is a correlation-driven learning method, suitable for sparse networks\\nand low-power hardware but difficult to handle complex tasks and deep networks. Global learning is\\na loss-driven learning method, suitable for dense networks to solve complex tasks, but requires a lot\\nof computational energy consumption. Therefore, integrating local and global learning so that the\\nlearning algorithm has both the energy-saving advantages of local learning and the high-performance\\nadvantages of global learning is a significant research interest in the field of SNN.\\nThe biological three-factor learning rules Gerstner et al. (2018) Bailey et al. (2000) provide biologi-\\ncal insights for the new way of integrating local and global learning. The three-factor rule is that the\\nadjustment of synaptic weights depends not only on the activity of the pre-synaptic neuron and the\\npost-synaptic neuron but also on a third factor (e.g., neurotransmitter). Wu et al. (2022) also pro-\\nposed a hybrid synergic learning algorithm, which uses two sets of weights to update the weights of\\nlocal learning and global learning separately and then directly adds the two sets of weights, achiev-\\ning comparable performance. However, the current hybrid learning algorithm needs to trade-off\\nbetween the accuracy advantage of global learning and the low energy consumption advantage of\\n\\u2217Corresponding author: Qi Xu, xuqi@dlut.edu.cn\\n1\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nlocal learning. Moreover, the type of hybrid learning algorithms still needs more reasonable biolog-\\nical plausibility. Hence, the current hybrid learning algorithms have some theoretical and practical\\nshortcomings and need further improvement and optimization via the excitation-inhibition mecha-\\nnism.\\nIn this paper, we propose an Excitation-Inhibition Mechanism assisted hybrid Learning(EIHL) al-\\ngorithm. Inspired by the excitation-inhibition mechanism of biological neural networks Rosenberg\\net al. (2023) Sadeh & Clopath (2021) Wang et al. (2022) Xue et al. (2014) Shea (2021) Simeone &\\nRho (2009) Wang (2020), We choose to distinguish between excitation and inhibition states accord-\\ning to the overall connection state of the network. When the neural network is in an over-excited\\nstate, it switches to an inhibited state. When the neural network is in an over-inhibited state, it\\nswitches to an excited state. Based on the dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition in the neural\\nnetwork, we achieve dynamic switching between global learning and local learning.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\\n\\u2022 We propose an excitation-inhibition mechanism-assisted hybrid learning(called EIHL),\\nwhich can combine the high accuracy of global learning and the low energy consump-\\ntion of local learning and showed excellent accuracy and sparsity in the experiments on\\nthree datasets and two models.\\n\\u2022 We obtained inspiration from neuroscience and adopted the excitation-inhibition mecha-\\nnism to solve the problem of how to reasonably integrate hybrid learning. The experimen-\\ntal results showed that EIHL also achieved sparsity advantages, which made it possible to\\ndeploy on hardware.\\n\\u2022 We used the neural excitation-inhibition mechanism to achieve the integration of global and\\nlocal learning and implemented it by adjusting the weights. This not only provides a new\\nperspective for the field of SNN training methods but also prepares for the generalization\\nof EIHL to the ANN domain.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"RELATED WORKS\\n2.1\\nLEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS\\nLocal learning: The Hebb learning rule Hebb (2005) states that the pre-synaptic neuron must be\\nactivated before the post-synaptic neuron. Based on these rules, spike-timing dependent plasticity\\n(STDP) was proposed by Song et al. (2000). STDP is a local learning algorithm that adjusts synaptic\\nweights based on the pulse timing interval between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Deep-\\nSTDP Lu & Sengupta (2023) is a local learning algorithm based on STDP, which uses pseudo-labels\\nobtained through clustering for loss backpropagation and updating of synaptic weights, significantly\\nimproving performance. However, Deep-STDP also increases computational complexity and energy\\nconsumption.\\nGlobal learning: The Backpropagation (BP) BP (1990) algorithm performs well in artificial neural\\nnetworks (ANNs) Agatonovic-Kustrin & Beresford (2000), but cannot be directly applied to spiking\\nneural networks (SNNs) Maass (1997). So, the SuperSpike Zenke & Ganguli (2018) algorithm em-\\nploys a gradient approximation method but does not consider the unique spatiotemporal information\\nof SNNs. The Spatio-Temporal Backpropagation (STBP) Wu et al. (2018) algorithm compensates\\nfor the insufficient SuperSpike algorithm. STBP is a modified variant of the backpropagation al-\\ngorithm specifically designed for training SNNs. STBP considers the temporal relationships and\\nconnectivity between spiking neurons, emphasizing the temporal nature of spikes. While STBP\\nperforms excellently in task recognition accuracy, it also brings greater computational complexity.\\nIn practice, Wu et al. (2022)proposed hybrid plasticity (HP), which uses two sets of weights to\\nupdate local and global learning weights, respectively. This hybrid learning method integrates local\\nand global learning, resulting in higher accuracy. HP inspired our method to fuse local and global\\nlearning from the weights perspective. In biology, the three-factor learning rules Gerstner et al.\\n(2018) Bailey et al. (2000) indicate that another factor affects synaptic strength besides the activity\\nbetween presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, such as neurotransmitters.\\n2\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\n2.2\\nEXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY MECHANISMS IN NEURAL SYSTEMS\\nNeuronal excitation and inhibition mechanisms have pathological and functional significance Rosen-\\nberg et al.

From a pathological\\nperspective, excitation-inhibition not only regulates the emotions of impulse or hesitation but also\\ninduces or reduces the frequency and duration of epileptic seizures, as well as improves cognitive\\nand memory functions Rosenberg et al. (2023). From a functional perspective, networks with exci-\\ntation and inhibition have stronger learning abilities than networks with only excitation, as shown\\nby Wang et al. (2022) who set positive weights as excitation and negative weights as inhibition in\\nan ANN with a monotonic activation function. They proved that networks with only excitation can\\nachieve monotonic functions and can not implement the XOR function.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"Preliminary\",\"section_content\":\"PRELIMINARY\\n3.1\\nINTEGRATE-AND-FIRE MODEL\\nThis paper uses the integrate-and-fire (IF) model as a single computational unit in SNNs, which is\\na biological neuron model that describes how neurons produce action potentials.

The solid lines represent the\\nconnections that exist, and the dashed lines represent the connections that are broken. In global\\nlearning, the LTP effect of excitation is synaptic enhancement, which makes the neurons in the net-\\nwork more active to fire spikes. In local learning, the LTD effect of inhibition is synaptic shrinkage\\nor even disconnection, which makes the neurons in the network more passive to fire spikes.\\nFirst of all, the challenge of hybrid learning lies in the integration of global and local learning.\\nWhile current hybrid learning methods have achieved excellent results in terms of accuracy Wu\\net al. (2022), they could do slightly better in integrating the low energy consumption advantage\\nof local learning. Therefore, based on the exciting Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) Malenka et al.\\n(1999a) results of global learning and the inhibitory Long-Term Depression (LTD) Ito (1989) results\\nof local learning, an excitatory-inhibitory mechanism is adopted to balance the two.

Finally, according to the excitatory-inhibitory mechanism, excitation and inhibition\\nare automatically balanced. As shown in Fig. 1. when the network is overly excited, it should be\\ninhibited, and when it is in an overly inhibited state, it should be excited.
