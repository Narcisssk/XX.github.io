{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Discussion\\nWe present NAVSIM, a framework for non-reactive AV simulation. We address shortcomings of\\nexisting driving benchmarks and propose standardized but configurable simulation-based metrics for\\nbenchmarking driving policies. For accessibility, we provide challenging scenario splits and simple\\ndata curation methods. We show that our evaluation protocol is better aligned to closed-loop driving,\\nbenchmark an established set of end-to-end planning baselines from CARLA and nuScenes, and\\npresent the results of our inaugural competition. We hope that NAVSIM can serve as an accessible\\ntoolkit for AV researchers that bridges the gap between simulated and real-world driving.\\nNeed for Reactive Simulation. While we show improvements over displacement errors, several\\naspects of driving remain unaddressed by evaluation in NAVSIM. A high PDMS does not always imply\\na high CLS, since our framework does not consider reactiveness or the compounding accumulation\\n2https:\\/\\/huggingface.co\\/spaces\\/AGC2024-P\\/e2e-driving-navsim\\n9\\nof errors in closed-loop simulation. Moreover, as in CLS, rear-end collisions into the ego vehicle\\nare currently not classified as \\\"at-fault\\\", resulting in little importance given to the scene behind the\\nvehicle in NAVSIM. In the future, data-driven sensor or traffic simulation could alleviate these issues,\\nonce such methods mature and become computationally tractable. Given these limitations of the\\ncurrent framework, we strongly encourage the use of graphics-based closed-loop simulators, such as\\nCARLA [17], as complementary benchmarks to NAVSIM when developing planning algorithms.\\nSimplicity of Metrics. As a starting point, NAVSIM offers both interpretable open-loop subscores\\nand a scalarizing function, which lets us provide a final score and ranking for participants in the\\nchallenge. In the future, multi-objective evaluation and other aggregation functions might be required.\\nMoreover, closed-loop metrics also face problems, i.e., PDMS inherits several weaknesses of nuPlan\\u2019s\\nCLS. Both scores do not regard certain traffic rules (e.g., stop-sign or traffic light compliance) or\\nconcepts such as transit and fuel efficiency. In the future, we aim to improve the subscore definitions\\n(e.g. the at-fault collision logic) and add more subscores during aggregation.\\nCall for Datasets. Certain limitations of the nuPlan dataset persist in NAVSIM, such as missing\\nclasses in the label space, minor errors in camera parameters, or noise in vehicle poses and 3D\\nannotations. Our analysis might favor methods that are robust to such inconsistencies. In addition,\\nthe lack of road elevation data in our representation presents a challenge for integrating scenarios\\nbased on 3D map annotations. We aim to support more datasets in the future, and advocate for more\\nopen dataset releases by the community for accelerating progress in autonomous driving.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the ERC Starting Grant LEGO-3D (850533), the DFG EXC number\\n2064\\/1 - project number 390727645, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research:\\nT\\u00fcbingen AI Center, FKZ: 01IS18039A and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs\\nand Climate Action within the project NXT GEN AI METHODS.

Specifically, for trustfulness, LVLMs may suffer from hallucinations that conflict\\nwith facts [95, 96, 69, 8, 87, 91, 88, 35, 76]. Previous methods evaluate LVLM hallucinations for\\nVQA [36, 11, 15] and captioning [36, 9, 70, 94], with models exhibiting significant hallucinations. For\\nsafety, attack and jailbreak strategies are leveraged to induce erroneous responses [63].

Our\\nfindings indicate that existing Med-LVLMs are highly unreliable, frequently generating factual errors\\nand misjudging their capabilities. Furthermore, these models struggle to achieve fairness across\\ndemographic groups and are susceptible to attacks and producing toxic responses. Ultimately, the\\nevaluations conducted in CARES aim to drive further standardization and the development of more\\nreliable Med-LVLMs.\\nAcknowledgement\\nWe sincerely thank Tianyi Wu for his assistance in data selection.

For input-level shifts, although Med-LVLMs are trained on data corresponding to the\\nmodality of the test data, they should robustly refuse to respond when the data is too noisy for making\\naccurate judgments. The results, as shown in Table 5, demonstrate a significant decrease in model\\nperformance, yet abstentions are rare. Regarding semantic-level shifts, we evaluate the behavior of\\nMed-LVLMs trained on radiology data but tested on another modality (e.g., fundus photography).\\nAlthough Med-LVLMs lack sufficient medical knowledge to answer questions from a new modality,\\nthe abstention rate remains nearly zero (see Table 6), indicating the model\\u2019s insensitivity to OOD\\ndata. Both results demonstrate that Med-LVLMs exhibit poor out-of-distribution robustness, failing\\nto detect OOD samples and potentially leading to erroneous model judgments.\\n4\\nRelated Work\\nMedical Large Vision Language Models.

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"CARES Datasets\\nIn this section, we present the data curation process in CARES. Here, we utilize existing open-source\\nmedical vision-language datasets and image classification datasets to devise a series of high-quality\\nquestion-answer pairs, which are detailed as follows:\\nEye\\nChest\\nCentral Nervous System\\nOral \\nCavity\\nCardiac\\nStomach\\nFoot\\nArticulatio \\nGenus\\nHand\\nPelvic \\nCavity\\nSkin\\nLarge \\nIntestine\\nSmall \\nIntestine\\nLiver\\nFigure 2:\\nStatistical overview of CARES\\ndatasets. (left) CARES covers numerous anatom-\\nical structures, including the brain, eyes, heart,\\nchest, etc. (right) the involved medical imaging\\nmodalities, including major radiological modali-\\nties, pathology, etc.\\nData Source. We utilize open-source medical\\nvision-language datasets and image classification\\ndatasets to construct CARES benchmark, which\\ncover a wide range of medical image modali-\\nties and body parts.\\nSpecifically, we collect\\ndata from four medical vision-language datasets\\n(MIMIC-CXR [27], IU-Xray [10], Harvard-\\nFairVLMed [45], PMC-OA [38]), two medical\\nimage classification datasets (HAM10000 [62],\\nOL3I [90]), and one recently released large-scale\\nVQA dataset (OmniMedVQA [21]), some of\\nwhich include demographic information. As il-\\nlustrated in Figure 2, the diversity of the datasets\\nensures richness in question formats and indicates\\ncoverage of 16 medical image modalities and 27\\nhuman anatomical structures. Details of the in-\\nvolved datasets are provided in Appendix B.\\nTypes of Questions and Metrics. There are two\\ntypes of questions in CARES: (1) Closed-ended\\nquestions: Two or more candidate options are pro-\\nvided for each question as the prompt, with only one being correct. We calculate the accuracy by\\nmatching the option in the model output; (2) Open-ended questions: Open-ended questions do not\\nhave a fixed set of possible answers and require more detailed, explanatory or descriptive responses. It\\nis more challenging, as fully open settings encourage a deeper analysis of medical scenarios, enabling\\na comprehensive assessment of the model\\u2019s understanding of medical knowledge. We quantify the\\naccuracy of model responses using GPT-4. We request GPT-4 to rate the helpfulness, relevance,\\naccuracy, and level of detail of the ground-truth answers and model responses and provide an overall\\nscore ranging from 1 to 10 [33]. Subsequently, we normalize the relative scores using GPT-4\\u2019s\\nreference scores for calculation.\\nConstruction of QA Pairs.\\nWe explore the processes of constructing QA pairs from both\\nclosed-ended and open-ended questions.\\nFirstly, we delve into closed-ended questions.\\nFor\\nclosed-ended yes\\/no questions, we utilize the OL3I [90] and IU-Xray [10] datasets, converting\\ntheir questions along with corresponding labels or reports into yes\\/no formats. For example, the\\nquestion \\\"Can ischemic heart disease be detected in this image?\\\" is transformed\\naccordingly.\\nFor closed-ended multi-choice questions, the multi-class classification dataset\\nHAM10000 [62] is converted into QA pairs with multiple options. For example, in the HAM10000\\ndataset, for lesion types, we can design the following QA pair: Question:\\nWhat specific\\ntype of pigmented skin lesion is depicted in this dermatoscopic image?\\nThe\\ncandidate options are:[A:melanocytic nevi, B:dermatofibroma, C:melanoma,\\nD:basal cell carcinoma]; Answer:\\nA:melanocytic nevi.\\nTo increase the diversity\\nof question formats and ensure the stability of testing performance, we design 10-30 question\\ntemplates for multi-choice question type (see detailed templates in Appendix C). Furthermore, to\\n3\\nenrich the dataset with diverse modalities and anatomical regions, a comprehensive multi-choice\\nVQA dataset, OmniMedVQA [21] is also collected. For open-ended questions, CARES features a\\nseries of open-ended questions derived from vision-language datasets, namely MIMIC-CXR [27],\\nHarvard-FairVLMed [45], and PMC-OA [38]. Specifically, medical reports or descriptions are\\ntransformed into a series of open-ended QA pairs by GPT-4 [49] (see details in Appendix C).\\nPost-processing. To enhance the quality of the generated open-ended question-answer pairs, we\\ninstruct GPT-4 to perform a self-check of its initial output of these QA pairs in conjunction with the\\nreport. Subsequently, we manually exclude pairs with obvious issues and corrected errors.\\nOverall, our benchmark comprises around 18K images with 41K QA items, encompassing 16 medical\\nimaging modalities and 27 anatomical regions across multiple question types. This enables us to\\ncomprehensively assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLM.\\n3\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Involved Datasets\\nWe utilize open-source medical vision-language datasets and image classification datasets to con-\\nstruct CARES benchmark, which cover a wide range of medical image modalities and anatomical\\nregions.
