{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Introduction\\nHuman pose estimation and tracking involve the identification and monitoring of human body parts\\nor significant joints. This task holds paramount importance in comprehending human activities and\\nanalyzing movements across various domains, including rehabilitation, sports, augmented\\/virtual\\nreality, autonomous driving. Consequently, numerous datasets [10, 33, 11, 20, 30] have been\\ndedicated to studying human pose estimation and tracking for various applications. However, despite\\nthe dynamic nature of human activity, most datasets assume that the subjects are well-groomed in\\nterms of motion and lighting conditions. Considering the reality of perceiving human motion, most\\nindividuals move in a dynamic fashion. Moreover, human activity occurs across various times of the\\nday, exposing individuals to diverse lighting environments. This diversity is directly reflected in the\\ncameras acquiring the data. Ultimately, AI models should strive to predict human body movements\\neven in such varied environments.\\nTo address this, we acquired human pose estimation and tracking dataset that tackle two extreme\\ncases that can occasionally arise when capturing images with cameras. Firstly, we obtained data\\n\\u2217Equal contribution.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.\\nincluding motion blur that may occur due to the movement of the subject or camera during the\\nexposure time. While videos from professional sports, captured by experts using high-end equipment\\nlike gimbals, tend to be clean, videos taken by average users often exhibit blur caused by moving\\nsubjects. Additionally, when the camera attempts to track human objects, motion blur caused by\\nthe camera may also occur. Therefore, solving human pose estimation and tracking within motion\\nblur is crucial. Secondly, we acquired data captured in low-light environments to perform human\\npose estimation and tracking under poor lighting conditions. The ability to analyze human actions\\nat low-light condition has been of continuous interest [22, 41, 17], prompting us to capture data in\\nconditions where very little light is present, allowing for scenarios people are barely visible. These\\ntwo extreme cases are closely related, as increasing the exposure time of the camera to compensate\\nfor the low intensity in low-light environments can exacerbate motion blur. Addressing both cases\\nsimultaneously is highly practical and reasonable, as they often occur together and solving them\\ntogether offers a comprehensive solution.\\nPerforming accurate human pose estimation and tracking in these extreme conditions poses a sig-\\nnificant challenge. Especially when both situations are present, relying solely on standard cameras\\nmay not provide sufficient information. Therefore, we augmented standard cameras with a auxiliary\\nsensor called an event camera [12, 44], also known as a neuromorphic camera. Event cameras mimic\\nthe human eye by providing pixel-wise changes asynchronously in an on\\/off manner. These cameras\\npossess high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, ensuring sufficient data even in low-light\\nconditions and being immune to motion blur. Therefore, to tackle extreme conditions, we introduce\\nthe Event-guided Human Pose Estimation and Tracking in eXtreme Conditions (EHPT-XC) dataset\\nand benchmark. To build the dataset, we constructed a multi-camera system to acquire high-resolution\\nRGB-Event paired data, enabling us to freely adjust camera settings for extreme conditions. Addi-\\ntionally, we captured diverse motions and scenarios through experimental participants and manually\\nlabeled the acquired data accordingly. The contributions and unique aspects of EHPT-XC datasets\\nare as follows:\\n\\u2022 Multi-human Pose Dataset with Neuromorphic Cameras. While existing datasets utilizing RGB\\nframes can be collected from various sources such as publicly available human-centric datasets and\\ndata shared on platforms like YouTube and the web, data collection using event cameras presents a\\nchallenge, particularly for human-centric datasets, as there are no readily available sources. We\\ngathered human data directly using a multi-camera system, making EHPT-XC the first multi-human\\npose dataset utilizing neuromorphic cameras. Moreover, EHPT-XC provides track IDs, enabling its\\nutilization for multi-object tracking. While datasets for event-based single-object tracking [48, 38]\\nexist, EHPT-XC stands as the pioneering dataset for multi-object tracking using event cameras.\\n\\u2022 Real-captured Data in Extreme Conditions. The EHPT-XC dataset aims to address scenarios\\ncharacterized by low-light conditions and significant motion blur. The absence of multi-human\\npose estimation and tracking datasets in such conditions stems from the difficulty in directly\\nacquiring data and annotating it due to the challenges posed by degradation conditions. To tackle\\nthis, we developed a multi-camera system consisting of a triplet camera configuration, where two\\ncameras capture RGB frames and the remaining one comprises an event camera. One of the RGB\\ncameras was configured to acquire data in low-light environments and\\/or motion blur by adjusting\\nits settings, while the other was set to capture sharp image under normal lighting conditions.\\n\\u2022 Indoor\\/outdoor Environments and Various Scenarios. The EHPT-XC dataset comprises data\\nnot only in general scenes but also in dynamic scenarios such as sports, encompassing a variety of\\nindoor and outdoor environments. This further emphasizes the motivation behind these low-light\\nand motion blur conditions. Additionally, we varied the number of people appearing in each\\nsequence to enhance the versatility of the dataset.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Related Works\\n2.1\\nHuman Pose Estimation and Tracking Datasets in Low-light Conditions.\\nSeveral datasets [45, 23, 21, 40] have been proposed to facilitate perception in low-light environ-\\nments.

However, datasets like ExLPose and WIHPD, which include captures in\\nlow-light environments, have significantly fewer total images, with 3K and 2K, respectively, and\\npose annotations of 15K and 7.3K, respectively. On the other hand, the proposed EHPT-XC dataset\\ncaptures diverse scenes despite the extreme conditions, comprising 16K total images and 38K pose\\nannotations, making it comparable to other datasets. Additionally, we captured a dataset that includes\\nimages with both reduced visibility, commonly observed in low-light environments, and motion\\nblur, distinguishing it from the ExLPose and WIHPD datasets. The inclusion of event data further\\ndistinguishes it, providing richer information for human action understanding.\\n2.2\\nHuman Pose Estimation and Tracking Datasets in Motion Blur.\\nThe dynamic nature of human motion naturally introduces blur into acquired data, which differs\\nin distribution from clean and sharp images. Failure to account for this during the training process\\ncan significantly degrade performance during inference. Existing works [53, 24, 25] have also\\nattempted human pose estimation on blurred images based on similar motivations. However, these\\nworks have not used real-captured blurred images; instead, they synthesized blur by interpolating\\nhigh frame rate videos for training and evaluation due to annotation labels. As mentioned in recent\\ndeblurring benchmarks [54, 27, 55, 16, 15], this synthesized blur differs from the actual process\\nof blur generation, leading to discrepancies in properties such as continuity and saturation. One\\nalternative approach is to acquire data during exposure time to capture real blur through motion and\\nperform annotation on these blurred frames. However, annotating accurate poses on images degraded\\nby such blur is extremely challenging and, in severe cases, may be impossible. To accurately annotate\\nposes on images generated through real blur processes, we constructed a multi-camera system with\\nsynchronization, enabling precise pose annotation even in situations with intense blur. Our EHPT-XC\\ndataset is the first study to enable annotation on the real blur images corresponding to the sharp\\nground truth, providing accurate human pose and track IDs even in blurred situations.\\n2.3\\nEvent-based Multi-human Pose Estimation and Tracking Dataset.\\nRecently, various multi-sensor datasets [4, 18, 14, 1, 8, 52] have emerged for human pose estimation\\nacross different edge cases. The EHPT-XC dataset, proposed for multi-human pose estimation and\\ntracking using event cameras, stands as the first of its kind. While there are no directly comparable\\nevent-based datasets to our work, existing datasets with some degree of similarity include single\\nhuman pose estimation, such as [57, 5, 39], and single object tracking, such as [38, 31, 35, 47]. These\\nworks primarily leverage the high temporal resolution property of the event modality to effectively\\naddress tasks. This underscores the value of our multi-modal dataset and highlights our unique\\nchallenge in venturing into the first work on multi-human pose estimation and tracking. Particularly,\\nbenchmarking low-light and motion blur as extreme conditions effectively utilizing the event modality\\nsets our work apart.\\n3\\nFigure 1: Our triplet camera system comprises two RGB cameras and one event camera, all aligned\\nusing two beam splitters. One RGB camera is set to capture sharp frames with short exposure time in\\na well-lit environment exclusively for annotation purposes, while the other RGB camera is configured\\nto capture low-light images through aperture adjustments or the use of ND filters or extend exposure\\ntime for acquiring blurred frames. The event camera was adjusted to ensure the exact same amount\\nof light enters as with the low-light camera by applying the same ND filter and aperture settings.\\n3\\nEvent-guided Human Pose Estimation and Tracking in eXtreme Conditions\\n(EHPT-XC) dataset\\nEHPT-XC encompasses RGB video frames from 158 diverse sequences, along with pixel-wise\\naligned and temporally synchronized event streams, and annotations containing 38K 2D keypoints\\nand bounding boxes with track IDs. To ensure accurate annotation in extreme low-light and motion\\nblur environments, we designed a triplet camera system. This system enabled the simultaneous\\nacquisition of RGB frames degraded by low-light and\\/or blur alongside sharp RGB frames.\\n3.1\\nTriplet Camera System\\nTo address the difficulty in marking accurate keypoints of human joints in images with strong motion\\nblur, where object boundaries and structures are hard to distinguish, as well as the challenge of\\nannotating in low-light environments where people are barely visible, we devise an approach using an\\nadditional RGB camera serving as a reference for annotation alongside RGB and event pair cameras.\\nThis additional RGB camera captures sharp and well-lit images, unlike the one recording blurred\\nand\\/or low-light images, and is used solely for annotation process.\\nCamera system with beam splitters. One of the issues when using multiple cameras to capture\\nthe same scene is that each camera has different camera coordinates and image planes, making\\npixel-wise alignment challenging. To address this, we utilize an optical device called a beam splitter\\nto divide incoming light into two identical beams, allowing two cameras to capture the same scene.\\nSpecifically, as shown in Fig. 1, two RGB cameras (BFS-U3-16S2C-CS) and one event camera\\n(Prophesee EVK4) are aligned two 50\\/50 mirror beam splitters, resulting in a minimal baseline. Our\\ncamera system aligns the axes of three cameras but there is still geometric misalignment due to the\\nremaining baseline. To deal with this, we correct the residual mismatching using homography-based\\ngeometric alignment.\\nCamera synchronization. Even if multiple cameras are geometrically aligned, another issue arises\\nfrom the fact that they can capture data at different time instances. To address this, precise time\\nsynchronization among the multi-camera setup is required, and we accomplished this by designing\\na micro-controller (ATmega) to serve as an external trigger for hardware-level synchronization of\\nthree different cameras. The event and two RGB cameras are connected to the micro-controller via\\na trigger cable, ensuring simultaneous transmission of signals. Recording software is then created\\nusing the provided C++ SDK of each camera product to control them by receiving signals from the\\nmicrocontroller. Each camera synchronizes with the falling and rising edges of the trigger signals,\\nallowing for control of the RGB camera\\u2019s exposure time with synchronized signals.

However, datasets like ExLPose and WIHPD, which include captures in\\nlow-light environments, have significantly fewer total images, with 3K and 2K, respectively, and\\npose annotations of 15K and 7.3K, respectively. On the other hand, the proposed EHPT-XC dataset\\ncaptures diverse scenes despite the extreme conditions, comprising 16K total images and 38K pose\\nannotations, making it comparable to other datasets. Additionally, we captured a dataset that includes\\nimages with both reduced visibility, commonly observed in low-light environments, and motion\\nblur, distinguishing it from the ExLPose and WIHPD datasets. The inclusion of event data further\\ndistinguishes it, providing richer information for human action understanding.\\n2.2\\nHuman Pose Estimation and Tracking Datasets in Motion Blur.\\nThe dynamic nature of human motion naturally introduces blur into acquired data, which differs\\nin distribution from clean and sharp images. Failure to account for this during the training process\\ncan significantly degrade performance during inference. Existing works [53, 24, 25] have also\\nattempted human pose estimation on blurred images based on similar motivations. However, these\\nworks have not used real-captured blurred images; instead, they synthesized blur by interpolating\\nhigh frame rate videos for training and evaluation due to annotation labels. As mentioned in recent\\ndeblurring benchmarks [54, 27, 55, 16, 15], this synthesized blur differs from the actual process\\nof blur generation, leading to discrepancies in properties such as continuity and saturation. One\\nalternative approach is to acquire data during exposure time to capture real blur through motion and\\nperform annotation on these blurred frames. However, annotating accurate poses on images degraded\\nby such blur is extremely challenging and, in severe cases, may be impossible. To accurately annotate\\nposes on images generated through real blur processes, we constructed a multi-camera system with\\nsynchronization, enabling precise pose annotation even in situations with intense blur. Our EHPT-XC\\ndataset is the first study to enable annotation on the real blur images corresponding to the sharp\\nground truth, providing accurate human pose and track IDs even in blurred situations.\\n2.3\\nEvent-based Multi-human Pose Estimation and Tracking Dataset.\\nRecently, various multi-sensor datasets [4, 18, 14, 1, 8, 52] have emerged for human pose estimation\\nacross different edge cases. The EHPT-XC dataset, proposed for multi-human pose estimation and\\ntracking using event cameras, stands as the first of its kind. While there are no directly comparable\\nevent-based datasets to our work, existing datasets with some degree of similarity include single\\nhuman pose estimation, such as [57, 5, 39], and single object tracking, such as [38, 31, 35, 47]. These\\nworks primarily leverage the high temporal resolution property of the event modality to effectively\\naddress tasks. This underscores the value of our multi-modal dataset and highlights our unique\\nchallenge in venturing into the first work on multi-human pose estimation and tracking. Particularly,\\nbenchmarking low-light and motion blur as extreme conditions effectively utilizing the event modality\\nsets our work apart.\\n3\\nFigure 1: Our triplet camera system comprises two RGB cameras and one event camera, all aligned\\nusing two beam splitters. One RGB camera is set to capture sharp frames with short exposure time in\\na well-lit environment exclusively for annotation purposes, while the other RGB camera is configured\\nto capture low-light images through aperture adjustments or the use of ND filters or extend exposure\\ntime for acquiring blurred frames. The event camera was adjusted to ensure the exact same amount\\nof light enters as with the low-light camera by applying the same ND filter and aperture settings.\\n3\\nEvent-guided Human Pose Estimation and Tracking in eXtreme Conditions\\n(EHPT-XC) dataset\\nEHPT-XC encompasses RGB video frames from 158 diverse sequences, along with pixel-wise\\naligned and temporally synchronized event streams, and annotations containing 38K 2D keypoints\\nand bounding boxes with track IDs. To ensure accurate annotation in extreme low-light and motion\\nblur environments, we designed a triplet camera system. This system enabled the simultaneous\\nacquisition of RGB frames degraded by low-light and\\/or blur alongside sharp RGB frames.\\n3.1\\nTriplet Camera System\\nTo address the difficulty in marking accurate keypoints of human joints in images with strong motion\\nblur, where object boundaries and structures are hard to distinguish, as well as the challenge of\\nannotating in low-light environments where people are barely visible, we devise an approach using an\\nadditional RGB camera serving as a reference for annotation alongside RGB and event pair cameras.\\nThis additional RGB camera captures sharp and well-lit images, unlike the one recording blurred\\nand\\/or low-light images, and is used solely for annotation process.\\nCamera system with beam splitters. One of the issues when using multiple cameras to capture\\nthe same scene is that each camera has different camera coordinates and image planes, making\\npixel-wise alignment challenging. To address this, we utilize an optical device called a beam splitter\\nto divide incoming light into two identical beams, allowing two cameras to capture the same scene.\\nSpecifically, as shown in Fig. 1, two RGB cameras (BFS-U3-16S2C-CS) and one event camera\\n(Prophesee EVK4) are aligned two 50\\/50 mirror beam splitters, resulting in a minimal baseline. Our\\ncamera system aligns the axes of three cameras but there is still geometric misalignment due to the\\nremaining baseline. To deal with this, we correct the residual mismatching using homography-based\\ngeometric alignment.\\nCamera synchronization. Even if multiple cameras are geometrically aligned, another issue arises\\nfrom the fact that they can capture data at different time instances. To address this, precise time\\nsynchronization among the multi-camera setup is required, and we accomplished this by designing\\na micro-controller (ATmega) to serve as an external trigger for hardware-level synchronization of\\nthree different cameras. The event and two RGB cameras are connected to the micro-controller via\\na trigger cable, ensuring simultaneous transmission of signals. Recording software is then created\\nusing the provided C++ SDK of each camera product to control them by receiving signals from the\\nmicrocontroller. Each camera synchronizes with the falling and rising edges of the trigger signals,\\nallowing for control of the RGB camera\\u2019s exposure time with synchronized signals.
