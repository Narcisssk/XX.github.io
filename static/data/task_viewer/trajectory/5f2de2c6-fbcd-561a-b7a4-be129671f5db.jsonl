{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Multiple techniques such as data fltering and supervised fnetuning have been developed to strengthen LLM safety. However, currently known techniques presume that corpora used for safety alignment of LLMs are solely interpreted by semantics. This assumption, however, does not hold in real-world applications, which leads to severe vulnerabilities in LLMs. For example, users of forums often use ASCII art, a form of text-based art, to convey image information. In this paper, we propose a novel ASCII art-based jailbreak attack and introduce a comprehensive benchmark Vision-in-Text Challenge (VITC) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in recognizing prompts that cannot be solely interpreted by semantics. We show that fve SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2) struggle to recognize prompts provided in the form of ASCII art. Based on this observation, we develop the jailbreak attack ArtPrompt, which leverages the poor performance of LLMs in recognizing ASCII art to bypass safety measures and elicit undesired behaviors from LLMs. ArtPrompt only requires black-box access to the victim LLMs, making it a practical attack. We evaluate ArtPrompt on fve SOTA LLMs, and show that ArtPrompt can effectively and effciently induce undesired behaviors from all fve LLMs. Our code is available at https: \\/\\/github.com\\/uw-nsl\\/ArtPrompt.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (Achiam et al., 2023), Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Team et al., 2023) are increasingly deployed to serve users across various application scenarios.

The widespread use of LLMs highlights signifcant safety concerns (Weidinger et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a). Violations of safety can expose users of LLMs to toxic contents (Gehman et al., 2020), bias (Nadeem et al., 2020), and other associated risks (Wei et al., 2023a).\\nExtensive efforts have been made to ensure safety alignment of LLMs, including supervised fne-tuning (Bakker et al., 2022), reinforcement learning from human feedback (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022), and red-teaming (Dinan et al., 2019; Ge et al., 2023). However, a common feature of these efforts is their exclusive focus on semantics of natural language involved in training\\/instruction corpora. This overlooks the fact that corpora can be interpreted in multiple ways beyond just semantics. For example, the word \\u201cBOMB\\\" in Figure 1 is written using characters \\u2018\\\\*\\u2019 and spaces. Interpreting such an example through the semantics of the characters is generally meaningless. Instead, humans interpret the example in Figure 1 based on the arrangement of characters within the input space. This observa\\ntion raises the question:\\n\\u201cWill semantics-only interpretation of corpora during safety alignment lead to vulnerabilities of LLM safety that can be exploited by malicious users?\\\"\\nIn this paper, we address this question by making the following contributions. First, we develop a benchmark, named Vision-in-Text Challenge (VITC), to evaluate the capabilities of fve SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023), Gemini (Team et al., 2023), Claude (Anthropic, 2023), and Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023)) of perceiving and responding to queries in the form of ASCII art (Wagner, 2023), which cannot be interpreted using semantics of characters involved. Our results indicate that all fve LLMs struggle to understand input queries that use ASCII art to represent one single letter or number. Furthermore, the ability of the LLMs to correctly recognize input queries drop signifcantly (close to zero) as the input queries contain more letters or numbers.\\nSecond, we exploit the limitations of LLMs in recognizing ASCII art and reveal vulnerabilities of LLMs to a novel jailbreak attack, termed ArtPrompt. A malicious user can launch ArtPrompt by following two steps as depicted in Figure 2. In Step I, ArtPrompt fnds the words within a given prompt that may trigger rejections from LLM. In Step II, ArtPrompt crafts a set of cloaked prompts by visually encoding the identifed words in the frst step using ASCII art. These cloaked prompts are subsequently sent to the victim LLM to execute our jailbreak attack, resulting in responses that fulfll the malicious user\\u2019s objectives and induce unsafe behaviors from the victim LLM.\\n\\nThird, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate ArtPrompt on fve LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama2) using two benchmark datasets (AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) and HEx-PHI (Qi et al., 2023)). Our comparison with fve jailbreak attacks (Direct Instruction, GCG (Zou et al., 2023), AutoDan (Liu et al., 2023), PAIR (Chao et al., 2023), and DeepInception (Li et al., 2023a)) demonstrates that ArtPrompt can effectively and effciently induce unsafe behaviors from LLMs, and outperforms all attacks on average. We further evaluate ArtPrompt against three defenses (Perplexity, Paraphrase (Jain et al., 2023), and Retokenization (Provilkov et al., 2019)). We show that ArtPrompt successfully bypasses all defenses.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Work\",\"section_content\":\"Jailbreak Attacks. As LLMs become increasingly integrated in real-world applications, misuses of LLMs and safety concerns (Bender et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Carlini et al., 2021; Ganguli et al., 2022; Weidinger et al., 2021) have attracted attention. In particular, multiple jailbreak attacks against LLMs have been developed. Zou et al. (2023) and Jones et al. (2023) proposed gradientbased methods to search for inputs to LLMs that can trigger undesired outputs. Another line of work (Liu et al., 2023) used hierarchical genetic algorithm to automatically generate jailbreak prompts. Chao et al. (2023) proposed to use a pre-trained LLM to generate adversarial prompt to the victim\\nLLM. Alternatively, Mozes et al. (2023) and Kang et al. (2023) exploited instruction-following behaviors of LLMs to disrupt LLM safety. Manuallycrafted prompts for jailbreaking LLMs were constructed by Deng et al. (2023) and Yu et al. (2023). In context demonstrations were used in (Wei et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023b).\\nDefenses against Jailbreak Attacks. We categorize current defense against jailbreak attacks into the following two categories. The frst is Detection-based Defenses, which involve applying input or output flters to detect and block potentially harmful user prompts. For example, Jain et al. (2023) adopted input perplexity as an input detection mechanism to defend against jailbreak attacks. Helbling et al. (2023) leverages LLM\\u2019s own capabilities to detect whether it generates harmful outputs. SmoothLLM (Robey et al., 2023) detected harmful inputs by randomly perturbing multiple copies of inputs and aggregating the corresponding outputs to detect adversarial inputs. The second category is Mitigation-based Defenses. Jain et al. (2023) used paraphrase and retokenization to modify the input to reduce the success rate of gradientbased jailbreak attacks. Li et al. (2023b) proposed rewindable auto-regressive inference that allows LLMs to evaluate their own model outputs, and then use the evaluation result to guide the generation towards safer and more reliable outputs. Other defenses leveraged in-context prompt demonstration to enhance the safety awareness of LLMs (Wei et al., 2023b; Xie et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b). Xu et al. (2024) leveraged an expert model focusing on safety and developed a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to mitigate jailbreak attacks.\\nASCII Art Text. ASCII Art can be used to generate visuals using printable elements and enrich the text environment with enhanced human expressions (Wagner, 2023). Content that can be presented by ASCII Art are diverse, including portraits, objects, and rich-formatting texts. In our paper, we focus on (rich-formatting) texts represented as ASCII Art. We will demonstrate that SOTA LLMs are inadequately equipped to recognize prompts encoding information using ASCII art.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 VITC Benchmark to Evaluate LLM Capabilities of ASCII Art Recognition\",\"section_content\":\"In this section, we evaluate the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs when they are given prompts that cannot\\nbe interpreted using semantics. We design a benchmark called Vision-in-Text Challenge (VITC), and evaluate the capabilities of fve SOTA LLMs.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3.1 Design of Benchmark VITC\",\"section_content\":\"Goals. Our objectives are two-fold. First, we aim to comprehensively evaluate LLMs\\u2019 capabilities of responding to prompts that cannot be interpreted semantically. Second, we investigate potential strategies to improve the capabilities of LLMs.\\nDatasets. VITC provides two labeled datasets, namely VITC-S and VITC-L. VITC-S consists of 8424 samples and covers 36 classes. Each sample is a single character (e.g., a digit from 0 to 9, or a letter from A to $Z$ in upper or lower case) in the form of ASCII art. Samples with identical labels are represented in 234 different fonts fltered by human using Python art library . VITC-L consists of 8000 samples and covers 800 classes in 10 representative distinct fonts. Each sample in VITC-L consists of a sequence of characters obtained from VITC-S, where the length of the sequence varies from 2 to 4. Each sample is labeled by concatenating the corresponding labels of each individual character. Detailed statistics of VITC-S and VITCL datasets are presented in Table 1.\\nTask. We consider a recognition task on datasets VITC-S and VITC-L. An LLM performing this task is required to predict the label $\\\\hat{y}\\\\,=\\\\,f(x|x_{0})$ , where $x$ is a data sample from either VITC-S or VITC-L, $x_{0}$ is a task description prompt, $f(\\\\cdot\\\\vert\\\\cdot)$ represents the process of generating response under given prompt and input sample. When the predicted label $\\\\hat{y}$ matches the ground truth label $y$ associated with $x$ , then the LLM is considered to succeed in the recognition task.\\nMetrics. VITC employs two metrics to assess LLM performance on the recognition task. The frst metric is prediction accuracy $(A c c)$ , defned as\\nThe second metric, termed as average match ratio $\\\\left(A M R\\\\right)$ , is defned as follows:\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{D}$ denotes the dataset used for evaluation, $|\\\\mathcal D|$ represents the size of dataset, $x$ is a sample 1https:\\/\\/github.com\\/sepandhaghighi\\/art\\nTable 1: The statistic of VITC-S and VITC-L datasets.\\nfrom dataset $\\\\mathcal{D}$ , $y$ is the associated label, $M(y,\\\\hat{y})$ denotes the number of matched digits or characters between $y$ and $\\\\hat{y}$ . $A M R$ is particularly valuable when dataset VITC-L is used for evaluation since label $y$ has length longer than one. Different from $A c c$ which assigns a binary result for each individual sample $x$ , $A M R$ captures partial fulfllment of the recognition task. For example, when the predicted label is $\\\\hat{y}\\\\,=\\\\,a1c$ while the ground truth label is $y\\\\,=\\\\,a7c$ , we have $A M R\\\\,=\\\\,66.66\\\\%$ and $A c c=0$ . When the length of label $y$ is one, $A M R$ reduces to $A c c$ as a special case.\\n3.2 Experiments using our VITC Benchmark Models. We evaluate multiple model families, including closed-source models GPT-3.5, GPT-4 (from OpenAI), Gemini (Google) and Claude (Anthropic) and open-sourced model Llama2 (Meta).\\nExperimental Setup. The task description prompt $x_{0}$ indicates whether the data sample to be fed into LLM contains a digit or a character. We adopt three strategies when querying LLMs, including zero-shot (Kojima et al., 2022), few-shot In-Context-Learning (ICL) (Brown et al., 2020), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022b).\\nExperimental Results. In what follows, we report our experimental results obtained using our VITC benchmark.\\nLLMs struggle with the recognition task. Table 2 summarizes the performance of evaluated LLMs on the recognition task. We observe that all models struggle with the recognition task. For example, the highest performance (exhibited by GPT-4) on dataset VITC-S is only $A c c\\\\ =\\\\ 25.19\\\\%$ , which is considerably lower compared to evaluations on other tasks such as code completion, summarization, and math reasoning (Achiam et al., 2023). Notably, as model size increases (from Llama2-7B to Llama2-70B), performance slightly increases from $1.01\\\\%$ to $10.04\\\\%$ .\\nWhen evaluated on dataset VITC-L, the performance of all models deteriorate signifcantly. For example, GPT-4 only achieves $A c c=3.26\\\\%$ .\\nCompared to the evaluation results on VITC-S, the signifcant decrease on $A c c$ is because the recognition task becomes more challenging, i.e., samples contain sequences of digits or characters. Additionally, the highest $A M R$ among all models is $54.39\\\\%$ , achieved by GPT-3.5. This indicates that, on average, the model can only recognize about half of the digits or characters associated with a data sample.\\nIn summary, all evaluated LLMs exhibit poor performance on both datasets VITC-S and VITCL when assessed with metrics Acc and $A M R$ . The reason is that these models are trained with corpora that rely solely on the semantics for interpretation.\\nFew-Shot Prompting and CoT Provide Marginal Performance Improvement. We adopt the ICL and CoT as prompting strategies to investigate whether they can improve the capabilities of LLMs in the recognition task. The results are presented in Figure 8 in Appendix B. We observe that both prompting strategies provide marginal performance improvement. As we vary the number of demonstrations from one to four, we notice that the performance may not necessarily increase (e.g., Gemini and Llama2-13B). Furthermore, for models from the same family (Llama2-7B\\/13B\\/70B), smaller models barely gain performance improvement from demonstrations. Instead, these models may even be confused by demonstrations due to limited model capabilities (Achiam et al., 2023).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 A Jailbreak Attack via ASCII Art\",\"section_content\":\"In this section, we show that LLMs failing the recognition task (described in Section 3) create vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by malicious users to bypass safety measures implemented by LLMs, resulting in jailbreak attack.

First, given that LLMs often struggle with the recognition task, substituting words likely to trigger rejection by LLMs with ASCII art potentially increases the probability of bypassing safety measures. In the meantime, although LLMs fnd it diffcult to interpret specifc words represented as ASCII art, they can still infer what such a word might be based on the context content in the remainder of the prompt.\\nThese two insights inspire our design of a novel jailbreak attack, ArtPrompt, shown in Figure 2. ArtPrompt consists of two steps, namely word masking and cloaked prompt generation. In the word masking step, given the targeted behavior that the attacker aims to provoke, the attacker frst masks the sensitive words in the prompt that will likely confict with the safety alignment of LLMs, resulting in prompt rejection. In the cloaked prompt generation step, the attacker uses an ASCII art generator to replace the identifed words with those represented in the form of ASCII art. Finally, the generated ASCII art is substituted into the original prompt, which will be sent to the victim LLM to generate response. We describe the detailed design of ArtPrompt in the remainder of this section.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4.2 Design of ArtPrompt\",\"section_content\":\"Step I: Word Masking. The frst step of ArtPrompt is to mask the words within a prompt from the attacker that trigger rejections from LLMs. To serve this purpose, we place a mask on each word of the prompt from attacker, resulting in a masked prompt. As illustrated in Figure 2, by placing a mask on the word \\u201cbomb\\\" from the prompt \\u201cHow to make a bomb?\\\", the attacker generates a masked prompt \\u201cHow to make a ?\\\". If there are $N$ words in the prompt from attacker, then the attacker may generate $N$ such masked prompts in the worst-case. In practice, the number of masked prompts will be signifcantly less than N since the attacker does not need to mask function words such as \\u201ca\\u201d, \\u201cthe\\\", and \\u201cI\\\". These masked prompts will later serve as the template when generating the attack prompt in the subsequent step.\\n\\nCompared to the existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks (Zou et al., 2023; Jones et al., 2023), masking words that trigger rejections is more effcient. The reason is that there are fnitely many words within the prompt that need to be masked. By contrast, the search space of optimization-based jailbreak attacks, however, is discrete and infnite, requiring iterative procedures to search for words\\/- tokens that lead to successful jailbreak attacks.\\nStep II: Cloaked Prompt Generation. Given a masked prompted generated in Step I, the attacker utilizes an ASCII art generator to substitute the masked word with ASCII art. Subsequently, the ASCII art is integrated into the masked prompt obtained from the previous step, resulting in a cloaked prompt. For example, the ASCII art representing the masked word \\u201cbomb\\\" is shown in Figure 2. Then this representation is combined with the masked prompt to generate the cloaked prompt, as illustrated in Figure 2. Finally, the cloaked prompt is sent to the victim LLM for jailbreak attacks. An additional example on the cloaked prompt and the response from victim model is presented in Appendix C. We remark that if the attacker generates $N$ masked prompts in Step 1, then it can create $N$ cloaked prompts for jailbreak attack. Furthermore, all the cloaked prompts can be sent to the LLM simultaneously to reduce the latency incurred during attack.\\nIn comparison to existing jailbreak attacks that manually craft prompts (Deng et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023), ArtPrompt can be automated by simply stitching the output of ASCII art generator with the masked prompt. Furthermore, the cloaked prompt is readable by humans, making ArtPrompt more stealthy and natural compared to jailbreak attacks that manipulate tokens (Zou et al., 2023).\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"5 Experimental Evaluations of ArtPrompt\",\"section_content\":\"In this section, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate ArtPrompt.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Goals. Our objectives are two-fold. First, we aim to comprehensively evaluate LLMs\\u2019 capabilities of responding to prompts that cannot be interpreted semantically. Second, we investigate potential strategies to improve the capabilities of LLMs.\\nDatasets. VITC provides two labeled datasets, namely VITC-S and VITC-L. VITC-S consists of 8424 samples and covers 36 classes. Each sample is a single character (e.g., a digit from 0 to 9, or a letter from A to $Z$ in upper or lower case) in the form of ASCII art. Samples with identical labels are represented in 234 different fonts fltered by human using Python art library . VITC-L consists of 8000 samples and covers 800 classes in 10 representative distinct fonts. Each sample in VITC-L consists of a sequence of characters obtained from VITC-S, where the length of the sequence varies from 2 to 4. Each sample is labeled by concatenating the corresponding labels of each individual character. Detailed statistics of VITC-S and VITCL datasets are presented in Table 1.\\nTask. We consider a recognition task on datasets VITC-S and VITC-L. An LLM performing this task is required to predict the label $\\\\hat{y}\\\\,=\\\\,f(x|x_{0})$ , where $x$ is a data sample from either VITC-S or VITC-L, $x_{0}$ is a task description prompt, $f(\\\\cdot\\\\vert\\\\cdot)$ represents the process of generating response under given prompt and input sample. When the predicted label $\\\\hat{y}$ matches the ground truth label $y$ associated with $x$ , then the LLM is considered to succeed in the recognition task.\\nMetrics. VITC employs two metrics to assess LLM performance on the recognition task. The frst metric is prediction accuracy $(A c c)$ , defned as\\nThe second metric, termed as average match ratio $\\\\left(A M R\\\\right)$ , is defned as follows:\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{D}$ denotes the dataset used for evaluation, $|\\\\mathcal D|$ represents the size of dataset, $x$ is a sample 1https:\\/\\/github.com\\/sepandhaghighi\\/art\\nTable 1: The statistic of VITC-S and VITC-L datasets.\\nfrom dataset $\\\\mathcal{D}$ , $y$ is the associated label, $M(y,\\\\hat{y})$ denotes the number of matched digits or characters between $y$ and $\\\\hat{y}$ . $A M R$ is particularly valuable when dataset VITC-L is used for evaluation since label $y$ has length longer than one. Different from $A c c$ which assigns a binary result for each individual sample $x$ , $A M R$ captures partial fulfllment of the recognition task. For example, when the predicted label is $\\\\hat{y}\\\\,=\\\\,a1c$ while the ground truth label is $y\\\\,=\\\\,a7c$ , we have $A M R\\\\,=\\\\,66.66\\\\%$ and $A c c=0$ . When the length of label $y$ is one, $A M R$ reduces to $A c c$ as a special case.\\n3.2 Experiments using our VITC Benchmark Models. We evaluate multiple model families, including closed-source models GPT-3.5, GPT-4 (from OpenAI), Gemini (Google) and Claude (Anthropic) and open-sourced model Llama2 (Meta).\\nExperimental Setup. The task description prompt $x_{0}$ indicates whether the data sample to be fed into LLM contains a digit or a character. We adopt three strategies when querying LLMs, including zero-shot (Kojima et al., 2022), few-shot In-Context-Learning (ICL) (Brown et al., 2020), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022b).\\nExperimental Results. In what follows, we report our experimental results obtained using our VITC benchmark.\\nLLMs struggle with the recognition task. Table 2 summarizes the performance of evaluated LLMs on the recognition task. We observe that all models struggle with the recognition task. For example, the highest performance (exhibited by GPT-4) on dataset VITC-S is only $A c c\\\\ =\\\\ 25.19\\\\%$ , which is considerably lower compared to evaluations on other tasks such as code completion, summarization, and math reasoning (Achiam et al., 2023). Notably, as model size increases (from Llama2-7B to Llama2-70B), performance slightly increases from $1.01\\\\%$ to $10.04\\\\%$ .\\nWhen evaluated on dataset VITC-L, the performance of all models deteriorate signifcantly. For example, GPT-4 only achieves $A c c=3.26\\\\%$ .\\nCompared to the evaluation results on VITC-S, the signifcant decrease on $A c c$ is because the recognition task becomes more challenging, i.e., samples contain sequences of digits or characters. Additionally, the highest $A M R$ among all models is $54.39\\\\%$ , achieved by GPT-3.5. This indicates that, on average, the model can only recognize about half of the digits or characters associated with a data sample.\\nIn summary, all evaluated LLMs exhibit poor performance on both datasets VITC-S and VITCL when assessed with metrics Acc and $A M R$ . The reason is that these models are trained with corpora that rely solely on the semantics for interpretation.\\nFew-Shot Prompting and CoT Provide Marginal Performance Improvement. We adopt the ICL and CoT as prompting strategies to investigate whether they can improve the capabilities of LLMs in the recognition task. The results are presented in Figure 8 in Appendix B. We observe that both prompting strategies provide marginal performance improvement. As we vary the number of demonstrations from one to four, we notice that the performance may not necessarily increase (e.g., Gemini and Llama2-13B). Furthermore, for models from the same family (Llama2-7B\\/13B\\/70B), smaller models barely gain performance improvement from demonstrations. Instead, these models may even be confused by demonstrations due to limited model capabilities (Achiam et al., 2023).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"ArtPrompt is effective against all victim LLMs. We use AdvBench to evaluate the performance of ArtPrompt and all baselines on victim LLMs. We summarize the results in Table 3 and make the following observations. First, ArtPrompt is effective against all victim LLMs. For example, ArtPrompt using the Ensemble confguration achieves the highest ASR $(52\\\\%)$ among all jailbreak attacks on Claude, whereas most baselines except GCG fail with ASR being $0\\\\%$ . Furthermore, we observe that ArtPrompt is the most effective jailbreak attack on almost all victim LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. We note that on Llama2, AutoDAN and PAIR outperform ArtPrompt. However, both AutoDAN and PAIR fail to generalize such effectiveness to other models. Indeed, as shown in Table 3, on average ArtPrompt outperforms all baselines, achieving the highest HPR $(84\\\\%)$ , HS (3.6), and ASR $(52\\\\%)$ .\\n\\nWe also evaluate ArtPrompt on HEx-PHI (Qi et al., 2023) by representing the harmful instructions from HEx-PHI using ArtPrompt. The HS across the eleven prohibited categories in HEx-PHI when ArtPrompt is adopted are summarized in Figure 3. We observe that most victim LLMs exhibit safe behaviors when the harmful instructions are directly sent to the model to generate responses. However, when these harmful instructions are modifed using ArtPrompt, unsafe behaviors can be induced from victim models, even for well aligned model such as GPT-4.\\n\\nArtPrompt is effcient. In Figure 4, we present the average number of iterations required by ArtPrompt and other jailbreak attacks to construct the harmful instructions to victim models along with their ASRs. Here, the number of iterations refects the computational cost incurred by an attacker to launch the jailbreak attack. We observe that ArtPrompt achieves the highest ASR among all jailbreak attacks with only one iteration with the victim LLM. The reason is ArtPrompt can effciently construct the set of cloaked prompts, and send them to the model in parallel. However, optimization-based jailbreak attacks such as GCG require signifcantly larger amount of iterations to construct the prompt. These iterations cannot be processed in parallel because the optimization in subsequent iterations depends on results from previous iterations. This highlights the effciency of\\nArtPrompt compared to existing jailbreak attacks.\\nArtPrompt can bypass existing defenses against jailbreak attacks. In Table 4, we evaluate ArtPrompt when victim LLMs employ defenses PPL, Paraphrase, or Retokenization to mitigate jailbreak attacks. We make the following two observations. First, ArtPrompt can successfully bypass defenses PPL and Retokenization on all victim models. This highlights the urgent need for developing more advanced defenses against our ArtPrompt jailbreak attack. We note that Retokenization may even help ArtPrompt to improve ASR. We conjecture that this is because the spaces introduced by Retokenization forms a new font for ArtPrompt, which further reduces the chance of triggering safety measures deployed by victim models. Second, we observe that Paraphrase is the most effective defense against ArtPrompt. The reason is that Paraphrase may disrupt the arrangement used by ArtPrompt, and thus reduces the ASR. However, Paraphrase is still inadequate to mitigate ArtPrompt. We note that on average, ArtPrompt achieves $39\\\\%$ ASR and 3.18 HS when Paraphrase is deployed by victim models.\\nAblation analysis of ArtPrompt. Based on our analysis in Section 3, we have shown that the capabilities of victim models in recognizing ASCII art vary as the font of ASCII art changes. In Table 5, we analyze how the choice of font used by ArtPrompt impacts HPR, HS, and ASR. We use the tail-set fonts from Appendix A.3, and apply ArtPrompt to the harmful queries to all victim models. We observe that all metrics decrease slightly compared to those in Table 3. However, ArtPrompt still remain effective in jailbreaking all victim LLMs. To achieve the best effectiveness of jailbreak attack using ArtPrompt, it is necessary to confgure the Top 1 and ensemble strategy for ArtPrompt by leveraging our results in Figure 6.\\n\\nWe further perform ablation analysis on the impact of arrangements of ASCII art in Table 5. In this set of experiments, we arrange the characters forming ASCII art along the vertical direction. We observe that vertical arrangment leads to degradation in effectiveness of ArtPrompt. We conjecture that the reason is that vertical arrangement signifcantly reduces the prediction accuracy of the recognition task, making the victim models uncertain about the input prompt.\\nAblation analysis on the masked words setup used by ArtPrompt is deferred to Appendix B.2.\\nArtPrompt on models fne tuned with nonsemantic interpretations. To further assess the vulnerabilities introduced by semantics-only interpretation of corpora during safety alignment, we evaluate ArtPrompt on models fne tuned using VITC-S dataset. Specifcally, we use $60\\\\%$ data samples for fne-tuning and $40\\\\%$ data samples for testing the model performance on the recognition task of VITC benchmark. We observe that the fne-tuned model gets accuracy $71.54\\\\%$ , which signifcantly outperforms the original model (i.e., $10.26\\\\%$ in the recognition task.\\n\\nWe further evaluate the effectiveness of ArtPrompt on the fne-tuned model. We observe that HS of the responses returned by the fne-tuned model decrease compared to those generated by the original model. Specifcally, for the fne-tuned model, $64\\\\%$ , $10\\\\%$ , and $12\\\\%$ of responses yield an $H S$ of 5, 4, and 2, respectively. In contrast, for the original model, $72\\\\%$ , $8\\\\%$ , and $6\\\\%$ of responses yield an $H S$ of 5, 4, and 2, respectively. This indicates that providing LLMs with corpora that should not be solely interpreted by semantics could mitigate the vulnerabilities identifed in our paper. We believe that such vulnerabilities may be further mitigated if such corpora is used during pre-training and safety alignment procedures. However, we defer further exploration as future work.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"We note that the text content and specifc font used (i.e., the format encoding for individual characters) are important in the generation of ASCII Art Text. We consider the samples representing letters in VITC-S dataset, and apply the Acc metric for selection. The experimental results across different LLMs are demonstrated in Figure 6. We observe that while the ability of LLMs to identify ASCII Art text of letters varies signifcantly across fonts, there are certain subsets of fonts that exhibit similar performance patterns across all tested models.\\nTo reduce potential biases in our study, we selected fonts based on their consistent performance across various LLMs. Specifcally, we chose the head-set fonts from art library, which exhibited higher Acc across all models. This includes \\u2018alphabet\\u2019, \\u2018cards\\u2019, \\u2018letters\\u2019, \\u2018keyboard\\u2019, and \\u2018puzzle\\u2019.
